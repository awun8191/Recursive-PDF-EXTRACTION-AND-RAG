Note on SI units

The units used throughout the book are those of the Systéme Internationale d’Unités; this is
usually referred to as the SI system. In the field of the strength of materials and structures we
are concerned with the following basic units of the SI system:

length metre (m)
mass kilogramme (kg)
time second (s)
temperature kelvin (K)

There are two further basic units of the SI system — electric current and luminous intensity —
which we need not consider for our present purposes, since these do not enter the field of the
strength of materials and structures. For temperatures we shall use conventional degrees
centigrade (°C), since we shall be concerned with temperature changes rather than absolute
temperatures. The units which we derive from the basic SI units, and which are relevant to out
fielf of study, are:

force newton (N) kg.m.s~

work, energy —_ joule (J) kg.m’.s” =Nm
power watt (W) kg.m?.s> = Js"
frequency hertz (Hz) cycle per second
pressure Pascal (Pa) N.m” = 107° bar

The acceleration due to gravity is taken as:
-2
g =9.81ms
Linear distances are expressed in metres and multiples or divisions of 10° of metres, i.e.
Kilometre (km) 10° m
metre (m) lm
millimetre (mm 10° m
In many problems of stress analysis these are not convenient units, and others, such as the
centimetre (cm), which is 10™ m, are more appropriate.

The unit of force, the newton (N), is the force required to give unit acceleration (ms”’) to
unit mass kg). In terms of newtons the common force units in the foot-pound-second-system
(with g =9.81 ms) are

1 Ib.wt = 4.45 newtons (N)

1 ton.wt = 9.96 x 10° newtons (N)

xiv Note on SI units

In general, decimal multiples in the SI system are taken in units of 10°. The prefixes we make
most use of are:

kilo k 10°
mega M 10°
giga G 10°

Thus:
1 ton.wt = 9.96 kN

The unit of force, the newton (N), is used for external loads and internal forces, such as
shearing forces. Torques and bending of moments are expressed in newton-metres (Nm).
An important unit in the strength of materials and structures is stress. In the foot-pound-
second system, stresses are commonly expressed in Ib.wt/in’, and tons/in?. In the SI system
these take the values:
1 Ib.wt/in? = 6.89 x 103 N/m? = 6.89 kN/m?
1 ton.wt/in? = 15.42 x 106 N/m? = 15.42 MN/m?

Yield stresses of the common metallic materials are in the range:
200 MN/m’ to 750 MN/m?

Again, Young’s modulus for steel becomes:

E eet = 30 x 106 tb.wt/in? = 207 GN/m?

Thus, working and yield stresses will usually be expressed in MN/m? units, while Young’s
modulus will usually be given in GN/m’ units.

Preface

This new edition is updated by Professor Ross, and while it retains much of the basic and
traditional work in Case & Chilver’s Strength of Materials and Structures, it introduces modern
numerical techniques, such as matrix and finite element methods.

Additionally, because of the difficulties experienced by many of today’s students with basic
traditional mathematics, the book includes an introductory chapter which covers in some detail the
application of elementary mathematics to some problems involving simple statics.

The 1971 edition was begun by Mr. John Case and Lord Chilver but, because of the death of
Mr. John Case, it was completed by Lord Chilver.

Whereas many of the chapters are retained in their 1971 version, much tuning has been applied
to some chapters, plus the inclusion of other important topics, such as the plastic theory of rigid
jointed frames, the torsion of non-circular sections, thick shells, flat plates and the stress analysis
of composites.

The book covers most of the requirements for an engineering undergraduate course on strength
of materials and structures.

The introductory chapter presents much of the mathematics required for solving simple
problems in statics.

Chapter 1 provides a simple introduction to direct stresses and discusses some of the
fundamental features under the title: Strength of materials and structures.

Chapter 2 is on pin-jointed frames and shows how to calculate the internal forces in some
simple pin-jointed trusses. Chapter 3 introduces shearing stresses and Chapter 4 discusses the
modes of failure of some structural] joints.

Chapter 5 is on two-dimensional stress and strain systems and Chapter 6 is on thin walled
circular cylindrical and spherical pressure vessels.

Chapter 7 deals with bending moments and shearing forces in beams, which are extended in
Chapters 13 and 14 to include beam deflections. Chapter 8 is on geometrical properties.

Chapters 9 and 10 cover direct and shear stresses due to the bending of beams, which are
extended in Chapter 13. Chapter 11 is on beam theory for beams made from two dissimilar
materials. Chapter 15 introduces the plastic hinge theory and Chapter 16 introduces stresses due
to torsion. Chapter 17 is on energy methods and, among other applications, introduces the plastic
design of rigid-jointed plane frames.

Chapter 18 is on elastic buckling.

Chapter 19 is on flat plate theory and Chapter 20 is on the torsion of non-circular sections.
Chapter 21 is on thick cylinders and spheres.

Chapter 22 introduces matrix algebra and Chapter 23 introduces the matrix displacement
method.

Chapter 24 introduces the finite element method and in Chapter 25 this method is extended to

cover the vibrations of complex structures.

Introduction

1.1 Introduction

Stress analysis is an important part of engineering science, as failure of most engineering
components is usually due to stress. The component under a stress investigation can vary from the
legs of an integrated circuit to the legs of an offshore drilling rig, or from a submarine pressure hull
to the fuselage of a jumbo jet aircraft.

The present chapter will commence with elementary trigonometric definitions and show how
elementary trigonometry can be used for analysing simple pin-jointed frameworks (or trusses).
The chapter will then be extended to define couples and show the reader how to take moments.

1.2 Trigonometrical definitions

Figure I.1  Right-angled triangle.

With reference to Figure I.1,

sin6 = be/ac
cos@ = ab/ac (1.1)
tan@ = bc/ab

For a triangle without a right angle in it, as shown in Figure I.2, the sine and cosine rules can be
used to determine the lengths of unknown sides or the value of unknown angles.

2 Introduction

Figure I.2. Triangle with no right angle.

The sine rule states that:

a _ b _ c 1D
sin A sinB —ssinC (1.2)

where
a = length of side BC; opposite the angle A

6b = length of side AC; opposite the angle B
c = length of side AB; opposite the angle C
The cosine rule states that:

a =b’ +c’ -2becosA

1.3 Vectors and scalars

A scalar is a quantity which has magnitude but no direction, such as a mass, length and time. A
vector is a quantity which has magnitude and direction, such as weight, force, velocity and
acceleration.

NB It is interesting to note that the moment of a couple, (Section I.6) and energy
(Chapter 17), have the same units; but a moment of a couple is a vector quantity and
energy is a scalar quantity.

1.4 Newton’s laws of motion

These are very important in engineering mechanics, as they form the very fundamentals of this
topic.
Newton’s three laws of motion were first published by Sir !saac Newton in The Principia in
1687, and they can be expressed as follows:
(1) Every body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is
compelled by an external force to change that state.

(2) The rate of change of momentum of a body with respect to time, is proportional to the
resultant force, and takes place in a direction of which the resultant force acts.

(3) Action and reaction are equal and opposite.

1.5 Elementary statics

The trigonometrical formulae of J.2 can be used in statics. Consider the force F acting on an angle
6 to the horizontal, as shown by Figure I.3(a). Now as the force F is a vector, (i.e. it has magnitude
and direction), it can be represented as being equivalent to its horizontal and vertical components,
namely F,, and F,, respectively, as shown by Figure [.3(b). These horizontal and vertical
components are also vectors, as they have magnitude and direction.

NB If F is drawn to scale, it is possible to obtain F,, and F,, from the scaled drawing.

F,+F,sin30 =0

F, = 2.887 kN (tension)

The force diagram is as follows:

2.89 kN A

5 kN

-5.77 KN

Another method of determining the internal forces in the truss shown on page 4 is through the
use of the triangle of forces. For this method, the magnitude and the direction of the known force,
namely the 5KN load in this case, must be drawn to scale.

6 Introduction

To complete the triangle, the directions of the unknown forces, namely F, and F, must be drawn,
as shown above. The directions of these forces can then be drawn by adding the arrowheads to the
triangle so that the arrowheads are either all in a clockwise direction or, alternatively, all in a
counter-clockwise direction.

Applying the sine rule to the triangle of forces above,

5S. ¥
sin 60 sin 30
pF = 2X9 _ a 987 kn

Similarly by applying the sine rule:

5. #
sin 60 sin 90

. Fy, = ——= =5.77KN

These forces can now be transferred to the joint A of the pin-jointed truss below, where it can be
seen that the member with the load F, is in tension, and that the member with the load F, is in
compression.

1.6 Couples

A couple can be described as the moment produced by two equal and opposite forces acting
together, as shown in Figure I.4 where,

It should be noted from Figure I.4 that the lever can be described as the perpendicular distance
between the line of action of the two forces causing the couple.

Furthermore, in Figure I.5, although the above definition still applies, the same value of couple
can be calculated, if the lever is chosen as the perpendicular distance between the components of
the force that are perpendicular to the lever, and the forces acting on this lever are in fact those
components of force.

8 Introduction
1.7 Equilibrium
This section will be limited to one- or two-dimensional systems, where all the forces and couples
will be acting in on plane; such a system of forces is called a coplanar system.
In two dimensions, equilibrium is achieved when the following laws are satisfied:
(1) upward forces = downward forces
(2) _ forces to the left = forces to the right
(3) clockwise couples = counter-clockwise couples.
To demonstrate the use of these two-dimensional laws of equilibrium, the following problems will

be considered.

Problem 1.2 Determine the values of the reactions R, and R,, when a beam is simply-
supported at its ends and subjected to a downward force of 5 KN.

Solution

For this problem, it will be necessary to take moments. By taking moments, it is meant that the
values of the moments must be considered about a suitable position.

Suitable positions for taking moments on this beam are A and B. This is because, if moments
are taken about 4, the unknown section R, will have no lever and hence, no moment about A,
thereby simplifying the arithmetic. Similarly, by taking moments about B, the unknown R, will
have no lever and hence, no moment about B, thereby simplifying the arithmetic.

1.1 Introduction

The strength of a material, whatever its nature, is defined largely by the internal stresses, or
intensities of force, in the material. A knowledge of these stresses is essential to the safe design
of a machine, aircraft, or any type of structure. Most practical structures consist of complex
arrangements of many component members; an aircraft fuselage, for example, usually consists of
an elaborate system of interconnected sheeting, longitudinal stringers, and transverse rings. The
detailed stress analysis of such a structure is a difficult task, even when the loading conditions are
simple. The problem is complicated further because the loads experienced by a structure are
variable and sometimes unpredictable. We shall be concerned mainly with stresses in materials
under relatively simple loading conditions; we begin with a discussion of the behaviour of a
stretched wire, and introduce the concepts of direct stress and strain.

1.2 Stretching of a steel wire

One of the simplest loading conditions of a material is that of tension, in which the fibres of the
material are stretched. Consider, for example, a long steel wire held rigidly at its upper end, Figure
1.1, and loaded by a mass hung from the lower end. If vertical movements of the lower end are
observed during loading it will be found that the wire is stretched by a small, but measurable,
amount from its original unloaded length. The material of the wire is composed of a large number
of small crystals which are only visible under a microscopic study; these crystals have irregularly
shaped boundaries, and largely random orientations with respect to each other; as loads are applied
to the wire, the crystal structure of the metal is distorted.

Stretching of a steel wire 13

For small loads it is found that the extension of the wire is roughly proportional to the applied load,
Figure 1.2. This linear relationship between load and extension was discovered by Robert Hooke
in 1678; a material showing this characteristic is said to obey Hooke’s law.

As the tensile load in the wire is increased, a stage is reached where the material ceases to show
this linear characteristic; the corresponding point on the load—extension curve of Figure 1.2 is
known as the limit of proportionality. If the wire is made from a high-strength steel then the
load—extension curve up to the breaking point has the form shown in Figure 1.2. Beyond the limit
of proportionality the extension of the wire increases non-linearly up to the elastic limit and,
eventually, the breaking point.

The elastic limit is important because it divides the load—extension curve into two regions. For
loads up to the elastic limit, the wire returns to its original unstretched length on removal of the
loads; this property of a material to recover its original form on removal of the loads is known as
elasticity; the steel wire behaves, in fact, as a still elastic spring. When loads are applied above the
elastic limit, and are then removed, it is found that the wire recovers only part of its extension and
is stretched permanently; in this condition the wire is said to have undergone an inelastic, or
plastic, extension. For most materials, the limit of proportionality and the elastic limit are assumed
to have the same value.

In the case of elastic extensions, work performed in stretching the wire is stored as strain
energy in the material; this energy is recovered when the loads are removed. During inelastic
extensions, work is performed in making permanent changes in the internal structure of the
material; not all the work performed during an inelastic extension is recoverable on removal of the
loads; this energy reappears in other forms, mainly as heat.

The load—extension curve of Figure 1.2 is not typical of all materials; it is reasonably typical,
however, of the behaviour of brittle materials, which are discussed more fully in Section 1.5. An
important feature of most engineering materials is that they behave elastically up to the limit of
proportionality, that is, all extensions are recoverable for loads up to this limit. The concepts of
linearity and elasticity’ form the basis of the theory of small deformations in stressed materials.

‘The definition of elasticity requires only that the extensions are recoverable on removal of the loads; this does not preclude
the possibility of a non-linear relation between load and extension .

14 Tension and compression: direct stresses

1.3 Tensile and compressive stresses

The wire of Figure 1.1 was pulled by the action of a mass attached to the lower end; in this
condition the wire is in tension. Consider a cylindrical bar ab, Figure 1.3, which has a uniform
cross-section throughout its length. Suppose that at each end of the bar the cross-section is divided
into small elements of equal area; the cross-sections are taken normal to the longitudinal axis of
the bar. To each of these elemental areas an equal tensile load is applied normal to the cross-
section and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bar. The bar is then uniformly stressed in
tension.

Suppose the total load on the end cross-sections is P; if an imaginary break is made
perpendicular to the axis of the bar at the section c, Figure 1.3, then equal forces P are required at
the section c to maintain equilibrium of the lengths ac and cb. This is equally true for any section
across the bar, and hence on any imaginary section perpendicular to the axis of the bar there is a
total force P.

When tensile tests are carried out on steel wires of the same material, but of different cross-
sectional area, the breaking loads are found to be proportional approximately to the respective
cross-sectional areas of the wires. This is so because the tensile strength is governed by the
intensity of force on a normal cross-section of a wire, and not by the total force. This intensity of
force is known as stress; in Figure 1.3 the tensile stress o at any normal cross-section of the bar
is

P
- 1.1
6 (1.1)

where P is the total force on a cross-section and A is the area of the cross-section.

p

tensile stress over any imaginary normal cross-section.

Tensile and compressive stresses 15

In Figure 1.3 uniform stressing of the bar was ensured by applying equal loads to equal small areas
at the ends of the bar. In general we are not dealing with equal force intensities of this type, and
a more precise definition of stress is required. Suppose 5A is an element of area of the cross-
section of the bar, Figure 1.4; if the normal force acting on this element is 5P, then the tensile stress
at this point of the cross-section is defined as the limiting value of the ratio (6P/6A) as 5A becomes
infinitesimally small. Thus

This definition of stress is used in studying problems of non-uniform stress distribution in
materials.

Figure 1.4 Normal load on an element of area of the cross-section.

When the forces P in Figure 1.3 are reversed in direction at each end of the bar they tend to
compress the bar; the loads then give rise to compressive stresses. Tensile and compressive
stresses are together referred to as direct (or normal) stresses, because they act perpendicularly to
the surface.

Tensile and compressive strains 17

1.4 Tensile and compressive strains

In the steel wire experiment of Figure 1.1 we discussed the extension of the whole wire. If we
measure the extension of, say, the lowest quarter-length of the wire we find that for a given load
it is equal to a quarter of the extension of the whole wire. In general we find that, at a given load,
the ratio of the extension of any length to that length is constant for all parts of the wire; this ratio
is known as the tensile strain.

Suppose the initial unstrained length of the wire is L,, and the e is the extension due to
straining; the tensile strain ¢ is defined as

This definition of strain is useful only for small distortions, in which the extension e is small
compared with the original length L,; this definition is adequate for the study of most engineering
problems, where we are concerned with values of € of the order 0.001, or so.

If a material is compressed the resulting strain is defined in a similar way, except that e is the
contraction of a length.

We note that strain is a 2on-dimensional quantity, being the ratio of the extension, or
contraction, of a bar to its original length.

1.5 Stress-strain curves for brittle materials

Many of the characteristics of a material can be deduced from the tensile test. In the experiment
of Figure 1.1 we measured the extensions of the wire for increasing loads; it is more convenient
to compare materials in terms of stresses and strains, rather than loads and extensions of a
particular specimen of a material.

The tensile stress-strain curve for a high-strength steel has the form shown in Figure 1.5. The
stress at any stage is the ratio of the load of the original cross-sectional area of the test specimen;
the strain is the elongation of a unit length of the test specimen. For stresses up to about 750
MN/m’ the stress-strain curve is linear, showing that the material obeys Hooke’s law in this range;
the material is also elastic in this range, and no permanent extensions remain after removal of the
stresses. The ratio of stress to strain for this linear region is usually about 200 GN/m’ for steels;
this ratio is known as Young’s modulus and is denoted by E. The strain at the limit of
proportionality is of the order 0.003, and is small compared with strains of the order 0.100 at
fracture.

Stress—strain curves for brittle materials 19

We note that Young’s modulus has the units of a stress; the value of £ defines the constant in the
linear relation between stress and strain in the elastic range of the material. We have

its length, then

where e¢ is the extension of the length Z,. Thus the expansion is given by
PL,
= 1.6
e ry (1.6)

If the material is stressed beyond the linear-elastic range the limit of proportionality is
exceeded, and the strains increase non-linearly with the stresses. Moreover, removal of the stress
leaves the material with some permanent extension; this range is then both non-linear and inelastic.
The maximum stress attained may be of the order of 1500 MN/m’, and the total extension, or
elongation, at this stage may be of the order of 10%.

The curve of Figure 1.5 is typical of the behaviour of brittle materials—as, for example, area
characterized by small permanent elongation at the breaking point; in the case of metals this is
usually 10%, or less.

When a material is stressed beyond the limit of proportionality and is then unloaded, permanent
deformations of the material take place. Suppose the tensile test-specimen of Figure 1.5 is stressed
beyond the limit of proportionality, (point a in Figure 1.6), to a point 5 on the stress-strain
diagram. If the stress is now removed, the stress—strain relation follows the curve bc; when the
stress is completely removed there is a residual strain given by the intercept Oc on the c-axis. If
the stress is applied again, the stress-strain relation follows the curve cd initially, and finally the
curve df to the breaking point. Both the unloading curve bc and the reloading curve cd are
approximately parallel to the elastic line 0a; they are curved slightly in opposite directions. The
process of unloading and reloading, bcd, had little or no effect on the stress at the breaking point,
the stress—strain curve being interrupted by only a small amount bd, Figure 1.6.

The stress-strain curves of brittle materials for tension and compression are usually similar in
form, although the stresses at the limit of proportionality and at fracture may be very different for
the two loading conditions. Typical tensile and compressive stress—strain curves for concrete are
shown in Figure 1.7; the maximum stress attainable in tension is only about one-tenth of that in
compression, although the slopes of the stress—strain curves in the region of zero stress are nearly
equal.

1.6 Ductile materials (see Section 1.8)

A brittle material is one showing relatively little elongation at fracture in the tensile test; by
contrast some materials, such as mild steel, copper, and synthetic polymers, may be stretched
appreciably before breaking. These latter materials are ductile in character.

If tensile and compressive tests are made on a mild steel, the resulting stress—strain curves are
different in form from those of a brittle material, such as a high-strength steel. Ifa tensile test

Ductile materials 21

specimen of mild steel is loaded axially, the stress—strain curve is linear and elastic up to a point
a, Figure 1.8; the small strain region of Figure 1.8. is reproduced to a larger scale in Figure 1.9.
The ratio of stress to strain, or Young’s modulus, for the linear portion 0a is usually about
200 GN/m’, ie, 200 x10° N/m’. The tensile stress at the point a is of order 300 MN/m’, i.e.
300 x 10° N/m’. If the test specimen is strained beyond the point a, Figures 1.8 and 1.9, the stress
must be reduced almost immediately to maintain equilibrium; the reduction of stress, ab, takes
place rapidly, and the form of the curve ab is difficult to define precisely. Continued straining
proceeds at a roughly constant stress along bc. In the range of strains from a to c the material is
said to yield; a is the upper yield point, and b the lower yield point. Yielding at constant stress
along bc proceeds usually to a strain about 40 times greater than that at a; beyond the point c the
material strain-hardens, and stress again increases with strain where the slope from c to d is about
1/50th that from 0 to a. The stress for a tensile specimen attains a maximum value at d if the stress
is evaluated on the basis of the original cross-sectional area of the bar; the stress corresponding to
the point d is known as the ultimate stress, 6,,,, of the material. From d to f there is a reduction in
the nominal stress until fracture occurs at { The ultimate stress in tension is attained at a stage
when necking begins; this is a reduction of area at a relatively weak cross-section of the test
specimen. It is usual to measure the diameter of the neck after fracture, and to evaluate a true stress
at fracture, based on the breaking load and the reduced cross-sectional area at the neck. Necking
and considerable elongation before fracture are characteristics of ductile materials; there is little
or no necking at fracture for brittle materials.

Compressive tests of mild steel give stress—strain curves similar to those for tension. If we
consider tensile stresses and strains as positive, and compressive stresses and strains as negative,
we can plot the tensile and compressive stress-strain curves on the same diagram; Figure 1.10
shows the stress—strain curves for an annealed mild steel. In determining the stress—strain curves
experimentally, it is important to ensure that the bar is loaded axially; with even small eccentricities

22 Tension and compression: direct stresses

of loading the stress distribution over any cross-section of the bar is non-uniform, and the upper
yield point stress is not attained in all fibres of the material simultaneously. For this reason the
lower yield point stress is taken usually as a more realistic definition of yielding of the material.

Some ductile materials show no clearly defined upper yield stress; for these materials the limit
of proportionality may be lower than the stress for continuous yielding. The term yield stress refers
to the stress for continuous yielding of a material; this implies the lower yield stress for a material
in which an upper yield point exists; the yield stress is denoted by oy.

Tensile failures of some steel bars are shown in Figure 1.11; specimen (ii) is a brittle material,
showing little or no necking at the fractured section; specimens (i) and (iii) are ductile steels
showing a characteristic necking at the fractured sections. The tensile specimens of Figure 1.12
show the forms of failure in a ductile steel and a ductile light-alloy material; the steel specimen (i)
fails at a necked section in the form of a ‘cup and cone’; in the case of the light-alloy bar, two
‘cups’ are formed. The compressive failure of a brittle cast iron is shown in Figure 1.13. In the
case of a mild steel, failure in compression occurs in a ‘barrel-like’ fashion, as shown in
Figure 1.14.

The stress-strain curves discussed in the preceding paragraph refer to static tests carried out at
negligible speed. When stresses are applied rapidly the yield stress and ultimate stresses of metallic
materials are usually raised. Ata strain rate of 100 per second the yield stress of a mild steel may
be twice that at negligible speed.

1.7 Proof stresses

Many materials show no well-defined yield stresses when tested in tension or compression. A
typical stress—strain curve for an aluminium alloy is shown in Figure 1.15.

£
Figure 1.15 Proof stresses of an aluminium-alloy material; the proof stress is found
by drawing the line parallel to the linear-elastic line at the appropriate proof strain.

The limit of proportionality is in the region of 300 MN/m’, but the exact position of this limit is
difficult to determine experimentally. To overcome this problem a proof stress is defined, the
0.1% proof stress required to produce a permanent strain of 0.001 (or 0.1%) on removal of the
stress. Suppose we draw a line from the point 0.001 on the strain axis, Figure 1.15, parallel to
the elastic line of the material; the point where this line cuts the stress—strain curve defines the
proof stress. The 0.2% proof stress is defined in a similar way.

1.8 Ductility measurement

The Ductility value of a material can be described as the ability of the material to suffer plastic
deformation while still being able to resist applied loading. The more ductile a material is the
more it is said to have the ability to deform under applied loading.

The ductility of a metal is usually measured by its percentage reduction in cross-sectional
area or by its percentage increase in length, i.e.

A; — A
percentage reduction in area = (4 = Ar) x 100%
and
; ; (4; ~ Lr)
percentage increase in length = TT x 100%
where

A, = initial cross-sectional area of the tensile specimen
A, = final cross-sectional area of the tensile specimen
L, = initial gauge length of the tensile specimen

L, = final gauge length of the tensile specimen

32 Tension and compression: direct stresses

It should be emphasised that the shape of the tensile specimen plays a major role on the
measurement of the ductility and some typical relationships between length and character for
tensile specimens i.e. given in Table 1.1

Materials such as copper and mild steel have high ductility and brittle materials such as
bronze and cast iron have low ductility.

1.9 Working stresses

In many engineering problems the loads sustained by a component of a machine or structure
are reasonably well-defined; for example, the lower stanchions of a tall building support the
weight of material forming the upper storeys. The stresses which are present in a component,
under normal working conditions, are called the working stresses; the ratio of the yield stress,
Gy, of a material to the largest working stress, o,, in the component is the stress factor against
yielding. The stress factor on yielding is then

<u (1.7)

on

If the material has no well-defined yield point, it is more convenient to use the proof stress, 6,;
the stress factor on proof stress is then

o
p (1.8)

Oy

Some writers refer to the stress factor defined above as a ‘safety factor’. It is preferable,
however, to avoid any reference to ‘safe’ stresses, as the degree of safety in any practical
problem is difficult to define. The present writers prefer the term ‘stress factor’ as this defines
more precisely that the working stress is compared with the yield, or proof stress of the
material. Another reason for using ‘stress factor’ will become more evident after the reader has
studied Section 1.10.

Load factors 33

1.10 Load factors

The stress factor in a component gives an indication of the working stresses in relation to the
yield, or proof, stress of the material. In practical problems working stresses can only be
estimated approximately in stress calculations. For this reason the stress factor may give little
indication of the degree of safety of a component.

A more realistic estimate of safety can be made by finding the extent to which the working
loads on a component may be increased before collapse or fracture occurs. Consider, for
example, the continuous beam in Figure 1.16, resting on three supports. Under working
conditions the beam carries lateral loads P,, P, and P;, Figure 1.16(i). If all these loads can be
increased simultaneously by a factor n before collapse occurs, the load factor against collapse is
n. In some complex structural systems, as for example continuous beams, the collapse loads,
such as nP,, nP, and nP,, can be estimated reasonably accurately; the value of the load factor
can then be deduced to give working loads P,, P, and P,.

1.11 Lateral strains due to direct stresses

When a bar of a material is stretched longitudinally—as in a tensile test—the bar extends in the
direction of the applied load. This longitudinal extension is accompanied by a lateral contraction
of the bar, as shown in Figure 1.17. In the linear-elastic range of a material the lateral strain is
proportional to the longitudinal strain; if €, is the longitudinal strain of the bar, then the lateral
strain is

(1.9)

The constant v in this relationship is known as Poisson's ratio, and for most metals it has a
value of about 0.3 in the linear-elastic range; it cannot exceed a value of 0.5. For concrete it has
a value of about 0.1. If the longitudinal strain is tensile, the lateral strain is a contraction; for a
compressed bar there is a lateral expansion.

34 Tension and compression: direct stresses

Figure 1.17 The Poisson ratio effect leading to lateral contraction of a bar in tension.
With a knowledge of the lateral contraction of a stretched bar it is possible to calculate the change
in volume due to straining. The bar of Figure 1.17 is assumed to have a square cross-section of
side a; L, is the unstrained length of the bar. When strained longitudinally an amount ¢,, the

corresponding lateral strain of contractions is €,. The bar extends therefore an amount €,l,, and
each side of the cross-section contracts an amount €,a. The volume of the bar before stretching is

V,= aL,
After straining the volume is
V = (a -g,a) (L, +8, Ly)
which may be written
V = a@L(1-s) (+e) = Vil -s) (1 +8)
If €, and €, are small quantities compared to unit, we may write
(l-s) (ite) = (1-28) (1+) = J +e, -2¢,
ignoring squares and products of €, and ¢,. The volume after straining is then
V= Vi (1+e,- 26)

The volumetric strain is defined as the ratio of the change of volume to the original volume, and
is therefore

V-V,

Lateral strains due to direct stresses 35

Ife, =v Ey then the volumetric strain is €,(1 -2v). Equation (1.10) shows why v cannot be greater
than 0.5; if it were, then under compressive hydrostatic stress a positive volumetric strain will

result, which is impossible.

Problem 1.10 A bar of steel, having a rectangular cross-section 7.5 cm by 2.5 cm, carries an
axial tensile load of 180 KN. Estimate the decrease in the length of the sides of
the cross-section if Young’s modulus, E, is 200 GN/m’ and Poisson’s ratio, v,
is 0.3.

Solution

The cross-sectional area is

The average longitudinal tensile stress is

The longitudinal tensile strain is therefore

The lateral strain is therefore

The 7.5 cm side then contracts by an amount

(0.075) (0.144 x 10°) = 0.0108 x 10°m
= 0.00108 cm

The 2.5 cm side contracts by an amount

(0.025) (0.144 x 107%) = 0.0036 = 10?m
0.00036 cm

1.12 Strength properties of some engineering materials

The mechanical properties of some engineering materials are given in Table 1.2. Most of the
materials are in common engineering use, including a number of relatively new and important
materials; namely glass-fibre composites, carbon-fibre composites and boron composites. In the
case of some brittle materials, such as cast iron and concrete, the ultimate stress in tension is
considerably smaller than in compression.

Composite materials, such as glass fibre reinforced plastics, (GRP), carbon-fibre reinforced
plastics (CFRP), boron-fibre reinforced plastics, ‘Kevlar’ and metal-matrix composites are likely
to revolutionise the design and construction of many structures in the 21st century. The glass fibres
used in GRP are usually made from a borosilicate glass, similar to the glass used for cooking
utensils. Borosilicate glass fibres are usually produced in ‘E’ glass or glass that has good electrical
resistance. A very strong form of borosilicate glass fibre appears in the form of ‘S’ glass which
is much more expensive than ‘E’ glass.

Some carbon fibres, namely high modulus (HM) carbon fibres , have a tensile modulus much
larger than high strength steels, whereas other carbon fibres have a very high tensile strength (HS)
much larger than high tensile steels.

Currently ‘S’ glass is some eight times more expensive than ‘E’ glass and HS carbon is about
50 times more expensive than ‘E’ glass. HM carbon is some 250 times more expensive than ‘E’
glass while ‘Kevlar’ is some 15 times more expensive than ‘E’ glass.

1.13 Weight and stiffness economy of materials

In some machine components and structures it is important that the weight of material should be
as small as possible. This is particularly true of aircraft, submarines and rockets, for example, in
which less structural weight leads to a larger pay—load. If ,,, is the ultimate stress of a material in
tension and p is its density, then a measure of the strength economy is the ratio

0

ult

p

The materials shown in Table 1.2 are compared on the basis of strength economy in Table 1.3 from
which it is clear that the modern fibre-reinforced composites offer distinct savings in weight over
the more common materials in engineering use.

In some engineering applications, stiffness rather than strength is required of materials; this is
so in structures likely to buckle and components governed by deflection limitations. A measure of
the stiffness economy of a material is the ratio

E
p

>

some values of which are shown in Table 1.2. Boron composites and carbon-fibre composites show
outstanding stiffness properties, whereas glass-fibre composites fall more into line with the best
materials already in common use.

Strain energy and work done in the tensile test 39

1.14 Strain energy and work done in the tensile test

As a tensile specimen extends under load, the forces applied to the ends of the test specimen move
through small distances. These forces perform work in stretching the bar. If, at a tensile load P,
the bar is stretched a small additional amount de, Figure 1.18, then the work done on the bar is
approximately Pde

p

Figure 1.18 Work done in stretching a bar through a small extension, de.

The total work done in extending the bar to the extension e is then

e

W = | Pde, (1.11)

0

which is the area under the P—e curve up to the stretched condition. If the limit of proportionality
is not exceeded, the work done in extending the bar is stored as strain energy, which is directly
recoverable on removal of the load. For this case, the strain energy, U, is

U = W = [ Pae (1.12)

0
But in the linear-elastic range of the material, we have from equation (1.6) that

PL,

e =

where L, is the initial length of the bar, A is its cross-sectional area and £ is Young's modulus.
Then equation (1.12) becomes

€

U = |# ede = FA (e7) (1.13)

0


40 Tension and compression: direct stresses

In terms of P

U = (ec?) = a (P?) (1.14)

Now (P/A) is the tensile stress o in the bar, and so we may write

y = A (6%) = 2 x thevol (1.15
= OE TE e volume .15)

Moreover, as AL, is the original volume of the bar, the strain energy per unit volume is

aa (1.16)

When the limit of proportionality of a material is exceeded, the work done in extending the bar is
still given by equation (1.11); however, not all this work is stored as strain energy; some of the
work done is used in producing permanent distortions in the material, the work reappearing largely
in the form of heat. Suppose a mild-steel bar is stressed beyond the yield point, Figure 1.19, and
up to the point where strain-hardening begins; the strain at the limit of proportionality is small
compared with this large inelastic strain; the work done per unit volume in producing a strain € is
approximately

W = Oye (1.17)
in which o, is the yield stress of the material. This work is considerably greater than that required

to reach the limit of proportionality. A ductile material of this type is useful in absorbing relatively
large amounts of work before breaking.

Figure 1.19 Work done in stretching a mild-steel bar; the work done during plastic
deformation is very considerable compared with the elastic strain energy.

Initial stresses 41

1.15 Initial stresses

It frequently happens that, before any load is applied to some part of a machine or structure, it is
already in a state of stress. In other words, the component is initially stressed before external
forces are applied. Bolted joints and connections, for example, involve bolts which are pre-
tensioned; subsequent loading may, or may not, affect the tension in a bolt. Most forms of welded
connections introduce initial stresses around the welds, unless the whole connection is stress
relieved by a suitable heat treatment; in such cases, the initial stresses are not usually known with
any real accuracy. Initial stresses can also be used to considerable effect in strengthening certain
materials; for example, concrete can be made a more effective material by precompression in the
form of prestressed concrete. The problems solved below are statically indeterminate
(see Chapter 2) and therefore require compatibility considerations as well as equilibrium
considerations.

Problem1.11 A 2.5 cm diameter steel bolt passes through a steel tube 5 cm internal diameter,
6.25 cm external diameter, and 40 cm long. The bolt is then tightened up onto
the tube through rigid end blocks until the tensile force in the bolts is 40 KN.
The distance between the head of the bolt and the nut is 50 cm. If an external
force of 30 KN is applied to the end blocks, tending to pull them apart, estimate
the resulting tensile force in the bolt.

m—— —-40cm —— - —»
2.5cm diam. bolt

' 5m internal diameter '

Solution:

The cross-sectional area of the bolt is

The cross-sectional are of the tube is

=; (0.0625) - (0.050/] = 5 (0-125) (0.0125) = 0.110 x 10°? m?

Before the external load of 30 KN is applied, the bolt and tube carry internal loads of 40 kN. When
the external load of 30 KN is applied, suppose the tube and bolt are each stretched by amounts 4;
suppose further that the change of load in the bolt is (AP),, tensile, and the change of load in the
tube is (AP),, tensile.

42 Tension and compression: direct stresses

Then for compatibility, the elastic stretch of each component due to the additional external load
of 30 kN is

(0.491 x 103) E (0.110 x 10°) E

where £ is Young's modulus. Then

(AP), = 0.357 (AP),

But for equilibrium of internal and external forces,

(AP), + (AP), = 30 kN

t

These two equations give

(AP), = 7.89 kN, (AP), = 22.11 kN

The resulting tensile force in the bolt is

40 + (AP), = 47.89 kN

1.16 Composite bars in tension or compression

A composite bar is one made of two materials, such as steel rods embedded in concrete. The
construction of the bar is such that constituent components extend or contract equally under load.
To illustrate the behaviour of such bars consider a rod made of two materials, 1 and 2, Figure 1.20;
A,, A, are the cross-sectional areas of the bars, and £,, E, are the values of Young's modulus. We
imagine the bars to be rigidly connected together at the ends; then for compatibility, the
longitudinal strains to be the same when the composite bar is stretched we must have

1.17 Temperature stresses

When the temperature of a body is raised, or lowered, the material expands, or contracts. If this
expansion or contraction is wholly or partially resisted, stresses are set up in the body. Consider
a long bar of a material; suppose L, is the length of the bar at a temperature 9,, and that a is the
coefficient of linear expansion of the material. The bar is now subjected to an increase 6 in
temperature. If the bar is completely free to expand, its length increases by aL,0, and the length
becomes L, (1 + a8) were compressed to a length L,; in this case the compressive strain is

aL, 8
= ——— = a6
L, (1 + a8)

since a@ is small compared with unity; the corresponding stress is
o = Fe = aE (1.21)

By a similar argument the tensile stress set up in a constrained bar by a fall @ in temperature is a8
E. It is assumed that the material remains elastic.

In the case of steela = 1.3 x10°° per °C; the product a£ is approximately 2.6 MN/m’ per °C,
so that a change in temperature of 4°C produces a stress of approximately 10 MN/m’ if the bar is
completely restrained.

1.18 Temperature stresses in composite bars

Ina component or structure made wholly of one material, temperature stresses arise only if external
restraints prevent thermal expansion or contraction. In composite bars made of materials with
different rates of thermal expansion, internal stresses can be set up by temperature changes; these
stresses occur independently of those due to external restraints.

Consider, for example, a simple composite bar consisting of two members—a solid circular bar,
1, contained inside a circular tube, 2, Figure 1.21. The materials of the bar and tube have

46 Tension and compression: direct stresses

different coefficients of linear expansion, a, and a,, respectively. If the ends of the bar and tube
are attached rigidly to each other, longitudinal stresses are set up by a change of temperature.
Suppose firstly, however, that the bar and tube are quite free of each other; if L, is the original
length of each bar, Figure 1.21, the extensions due to a temperature increase 6 are a, OL, and a,
@L,, Figure 1.21(ii). The difference in lengths of the two members is (a, - a,) 6Z,; this is now
eliminated by compressing the inner bar with a force P, and pulling the outer tube with an equal
force P, Figure 1.21(iii).

Problem 1.14 An aluminium rod 2.2 cm diameter is screwed at the ends, and passes through
a steel tube 2.5 cm internal diameter and 0.3 cm thick. Both are heated to a
temperature of 140°C, when the nuts on the rod are screwed lightly on to the
ends of the tube. Estimate the stress in the rod when the common temperature
has fallen to 20°C. For steel, E = 200 GN/m’ anda = 1.2 x10 per °C, and
for aluminium, E = 70 GN/m’ anda = 2.3 x 10° per °C, where E is Young's
modulus and a is the coefficient of linear expansion.

Solution

Let subscript a refer to the aluminium rod and subscript s to the steel tube. The problem is similar
to the one discussed in Section 1.17, except that the composite rod has its temperature lowered, in
this case from 140°C to 20°C. From equation (1.23), the common force between the two
components is

1.19 Circular ring under radial pressure

When a thin circular ring is loaded radially, a circumferential force is set up in the ring; this force
extends the circumference of the ring, which in turn leads to an increase in the radius of the ring.
Consider a thin ring of mean radius r, Figure 1.22(i), acted upon by an internal radial force of
intensity p per unit length of the boundary. If the ring is cut across a diameter, Figure 1.22(ii),
circumferential forces P are required at the cut sections of the ring to maintain equilibrium of the
half-ring. For equilibrium

2P = 2pr

P = pr (1.24)

so that

A section may be taken across any diameter, leading to the same result; we conclude, therefore,
that P is the circumferential tension in all parts of the ring.

If A is the cross-sectional area of the ring at any point of the circumference, then the tensile
circumferential stress in the ring is

P pr

Circumferential stresses of a similar type are set up in a circular ring rotating about an axis through
its centre. We suppose the ring is a uniform circular one, having a cross-sectional area A at any
point, and that it is rotating about its central axis at uniform angular velocity w. If p is the density
of the material of the ring, then the centrifugal force on a unit length of the circumference is

p Aw 2,
In equation (1.25) we put this equal to p; thus, the circumferential tensile stress in the ring is

o =—= po’r (1.27)

which we see is independent of the actual cross-sectional area. Now, or is the circumferential
velocity, V (say), of the ring, so

o = pV? (1.28)

For steel we have p = 7840 kg/m’; to produce a tensile stress of 10 MN/m’, the circumferential
velocity must be

A unit length of the cylinder is equivalent to a circular ring subjected to an internal load of p per

P = pr = p (0.150)

The circumferential stress is, therefore,

where t is the thickness of the wall of the cylinder. If o is limited to 75 MN/m’, then

are 70 GN/m? and 200 GN/m’, respectively, estimate the circumferential
stresses in the cylinders and the radial pressure between the cylinders.

Similarly, the mean radius of the steel tube contracts by an amount

52 Tension and compression: direct stresses

For the shrinking operation to be carried out we must have that the initial lack of fit, 5, is given by

1.20 Creep of materials under sustained stresses

At ordinary laboratory temperatures most metals will sustain stresses below the limit of
proportionality for long periods without showing additional measurable strains. At these
temperatures metals deform continuously when stressed above the elastic range. This process of
continuous inelastic strain is called creep. At high temperatures metals lose some of their elastic
properties, and creep under constant stress takes place more rapidly.

When a tensile specimen of a metal is tested at a high temperature under a constant load, the
strain assumes instantaneously some value €,, Figure 1.23. If the initial strain is in the inelastic
range of the material then creep takes place under constant stress. At first the creep rate is fairly
rapid, but diminishes until a point a is reached on-the strain—time curve, Figure 1.23; the point a
is a point of inflection in this curve, and continued application of the load increases the creep rate
until fracture of the specimen occurs at b.

At ordinary temperatures concrete shows creep properties; these may be important in pre-
stressed members, where some of the initial stresses in the concrete may be lost after a long period
due to creep. Composites are also vulnerable to creep and this must be considered when using
them for construction.

1.21. Fatigue under repeated stresses

When a material is subjected to repeated cyclic loading, it can fail at a stress which may be much
less than the material's yield stress. The problem that occurs here, is that the structure might have
minute cracks in it or other stress raisers. Under repeated cyclic loading the large stresses that
occur at these stress concentrations cause the cracks to grow, until fracture eventually occurs.
Materials likely to suffer fatigue include aluminium alloys and composites; see Figure 1.24.

Failure of a material after a large number of cycles of tensile stress occurs with little, or no,
permanent set; fractures show the characteristics of brittle materials. Fatigue is primarily a
problem of repeated tensile stresses; this is due probably to the fact that microscopic cracks in a
material can propagate more easily when the material is stressed in tension. In the case of steels
it is found that there is a critical stress—called the endurance limit—below which fluctuating
stresses cannot cause a fatigue failure; titanium alloys show a similar phenomenon. No such
endurance limit has been found for other non-ferrous metals and other materials.

2 Pin-jointed frames or trusses

2.1 Introduction

In problems of stress analysis we discriminate between two types of structure; in the first, the
forces in the structure can be determined by considering only its statical equilibrium. Such a
structure is said to be statically determinate. The second type of structure is said to be statically
indeterminate. In the case of the latter type of structure, the forces in the structure cannot be
obtained by considerations of statical equilibrium alone. This is because there are more unknown
forces than there are simultaneous equations obtained from considerations of statical equilibrium
alone. For statically indeterminate structures, other methods have to be used to obtain the
additional number of the required simultaneous equations; one such method is to consider
compatibility, as was adopted in Chapter 1. In this chapter, we will consider statically determinate
frames and one simple statically indeterminate frame.

Figure 2.1 shows a rigid beam BD supported by two vertical wires BF and DG; the beam carries
a force of 4W at C. We suppose the wires extend by negligibly small amounts, so that the
geometrical configuration of the structure is practically unaffected; then for equilibrium the forces
in the wires must be 3W in BF and Win DG. As the forces in the wires are known, it is a simple
matter to calculate their extensions and hence to determine the displacement of any point of the
beam. The calculation of the forces in the wires and structure of Figure 2.1 is said to be statically
determinate. If, however, the rigid beam be supported by three wires, with an additional wire, say,
between H and J in Figure 2.1, then the forces in the three wires cannot be solved by considering
statical equilibrium alone; this gives a second type of stress analysis problem, which is discussed
more fully in Section 2.5; such a structure is statically indeterminate.

56 Pin-jointed frames or trusses

2.2 Statically determinate pin-jointed frames

By a frame we mean a structure which is composed of straight bars joined together at their ends.
A pin-jointed frame or truss is one in which no bending actions can be transmitted from one bar
to another as described in the introductory chapter; ideally this could be achieved if the bars were
joined together through pin-joints. If the frame has just sufficient bars or rods to prevent collapse
without the application of external forces, it is said to be simply-stiff; when there are more bars or
rods than this, the frame is said to be redundant. A redundant framework is said to contain one or
more redundant members, where the latter are not required for the framework to be classified as
a framework, as distinct from being a mechanism. It should be emphasised, however, that if a
redundant member is removed from the framework, the stresses in the remaining members of the
framework may become so large that the framework collapses. A redundant member of a
framework does not necessarily have a zero internal force in it. Definite relations exist which must
be satisfied by the numbers of bars and joints if a frame is said to be simply-stiff, or statically
determinate.

In the plane frame of Figure 2.2, BC is one member. To locate the joint D relative to BC
requires two members, namely, BD and CD; to locate another joint F requires two further
members, namely, CF and DF. Obviously, for each new joint of the frame, two new members are
required. If m be the total number of members, including BC, and / is the total number of joints,
we must have

m= 3 - 3, (2.1)

if the frame is to be simply-stiff or statically determinate.
When the frame is rigidly attached to a wall, say at B and C, BC is not part of the frame as such,
and equation (2.1) becomes, omitting member BC, and joints B and C,

m= 2 (2.2)

These conditions must be satisfied, but they may not necessarily ensure that the frame is simply-
stiff. For example, the frames of Figures 2.2 and 2.3 have the same numbers of members and
joints; the frame of Figure 2.2 is simply-stiff. The frame of Figure 2.3 is not simply-stiff, since a
mechanism can be formed with pivots at D, G, J, F. Thus, although a frame having / joints must
have at least (27 - 3) members, the mode of arrangement of these members is important.

Figure 2.2 Simply-stiff plane frame built up Figure 2.3 Rearrangement of the members
from a basic triangle BCD. of Figure 2.2 to give a mechanism.

The method of joints 57

For a pin-jointed space frame attached to three joints in a rigid wall, the condition for the frame to
be simply-stiff is

m= 3 (2.3)

where m is the total number of members, and / is the total number of joints, exclusive of the three
joints in the rigid wall. When a space frame is not rigidly attached to a wall, the condition becomes

m= 3 -6, (2.4)

where m is the total number of members in the frame, and / the total number of joints.

2.3 The method of joints

This method can only be used to determine the internal forces in the members of statically
determinate pin-jointed trusses. It consists of isolating each joint of the framework in the form of
a free-body diagram and then by considering equilibrium at each of these joints, the forces in the
members of the framework can be determined. Initially, all unknown forces in the members of the
framework are assumed to be in tension, and before analysing each joint it should be ensured that
each joint does not have more than two unknown forces.

To demonstrate the method, the following example will be considered.

Problem 2.1 Using the method of joints, determine the member forces of the plane pin-
Jointed truss of Figure 2.4.

58 Pin-jointed frames or trusses

Solution

Assume all unknown internal forces are in tension, because if they are in compression, their signs
will be negative.

As each joint must only have two unknown forces acting on it, it will be necessary to determine
the values of R,, R, and H;, prior to using the method of joints.

This method is useful if it is required to determine the internal forces in only a few members. The
process is to make an imaginary cut across the framework, and then by considering equilibrium,
to determine the internal forces in the members that lie across this path. In this method, it is only
possible to examine a section that has a maximum of three unknown internal forces, and here
again, it is convenient to assume that all unknown forces are in tension.

2.5 A statically indeterminate problem

In Section 2.1 we mentioned a type of stress analysis problem in which internal stresses are not
calculable on considering statical equilibrium alone; such problems are statically indeterminate.
Consider the rigid beam BD of Figure 2.6 which is supported on three wires; suppose the tensions
in the wires are T,, T, and 7,. Then by resolving forces vertically, we have

T, +1) +T, = 4W (2.14)

64 Pin-jointed frames or trusses

and by taking moments about the point C, we get

T, - T, - 3T, = 0 (2.15)
From these equilibrium equations alone we cannot derive the values of the three tensile forces 7,
T,, T,; a third equation is found by discussing the extensions of the wires or considering
compatibility. If the wires extend by amounts e,, e,, e,, we must have from Figure 2.6(ii) that

e, + €, = 2e, (2.16)

because the beam BD is rigid. Suppose the wires are all of the same material and cross-sectional
area, and that they remain elastic. Then we may write

e, = AT,, e, = AT,, e, = AT,, (2.17)
where A is a constant common to the three wires. Then equation (2.16) may be written

T,+T, = 27, (2.18)

of a rigid beam supported by three extensible wires.

3 _ Shearing stress

3.1 Introduction

In Chapter 1 we made a study of tensile and compressive stresses, which we called direct stresses.
There is another type of stress which plays a vital role in the behaviour of materials, especially
metals.

Consider a thin block of material, Figure 3.1, which is glued to a table; suppose a thin plate is
now glued to the upper surface of the block. Ifa horizontal force F is applied to the plate, the plate
will tend to slide along the top of the block of material, and the block itself will tend to slide along
the table. Provided the glued surfaces remain intact, the table resists the sliding of the block, and
the block resists the sliding of the plate on its upper surface. If we consider the block to be divided
by any imaginary horizontal plane, such as ad, the part of the block above this plane will be trying
to slide over the part below the plane. The material on each side of this plane will be trying to slide
over the part below the plane. The material on each side of this plane is said to be subjected to a
shearing action; the stresses arising from these actions are called shearing stresses. Shearing
stresses act tangential to the surface, unlike direct stresses which act perpendicular to the surface.

In general, a pair of garden shears cuts the stems of shrubs through shearing action and not
bending action. Shearing stresses arise in many other practical problems. Figure 3.2 shows two
flat plates held together by a single rivet, and carrying a tensile force F. We imagine the rivet
divided into two portions by the plane ab; then the upper half of the rivet is tending to slide over
the lower half, and a shearing stress is set up in the plane ab. Figure 3.3 shows a circular shaft a,
with a collar c, held in bearing 5, one end of the shaft being pushed with a force F; in this case
there is, firstly, a tendency for the shaft to be pushed bodily through the collar, thereby inducing
shearing stresses over the cylindrical surfaces d of the shaft and the collar; secondly, there is a
tendency for the collar to push through the bearing, so that shearing stresses are set up on
cylindrical surfaces such as e in the bearing. Asa third example, consider the case of a steel bolt

in the end of a bar of wood, Figure 3.4, the bolt being pulled by forces F; suppose the grain of the
wood runs parallel to the length of the bar; then if the forces F are large enough the block abcd will
be pushed out, shearing taking place along the planes ab and cd.

shearing stress over the planes d.

Figure 3.4 Tearing of the end of a timber member by a steel bolt,

3.2 Measurement of shearing stress
Shearing stress on any surface is defined as the intensity of shearing force tangential to the surface.

If the block of material of Figure 3.1 has an area A over any section such as ab, the average
shearing stress t over the section ab is

F
t= (3.1)

In many cases the shearing force is not distributed uniformly over any section; if 6F is the shearing
force on any elemental area 5A of a section, the shearing stress on that elemental area is

Solution

There is a tendency to shear across the planes in the rivet shown by broken lines. The area
resisting shear is twice the cross-sectional area of the rivet; the cross-sectional area of the rivet is

A = 7 (0.015)? = 0.177 x10 m
The average shearing stress in the rivet is then

Problem 3.2 Two steel rods are connected by a cotter joint. If the shearing strength of the
steel used in the rods and the cotter is 150 MN/m’, estimate which part of the
joint is more prone to shearing failure.

Solution
Shearing failure may occur in the following ways:

(i) Shearing of the cotter in the planes ab and cd.
The area resisting shear is 2(fkmh) = 2(0.075 (0.015) = 2.25 x 10° m’

70

(ii)

(iii)

Shearing stress
For a shearing failure on these planes, the tensile force is
P = 1A = (150 x 10°) (2.25 x 10°) = 338 kN

By the cotter tearing through the ends of the socket g, i.e. by shearing the planes ef and gh.
The total area resisting shear is

A = 4(0.030) (0.035) = 4.20 x 10° m’
For a shearing failure on these planes
P = tA = (150 x 10°) (4.20 x 10°) = 630 kN

By the cotter tearing through the ends of the rod p, 1.e. by shearing in the planes k/ and mn.
The total area resisting shear is

A = 2(0.035) (0.060) = 4.20 = 10° m’
For a shearing failure on these planes
P = tA = (150 x 10°) (4.20 x 10°*) = 630 KN

Thus, the connection is most vulnerable to shearing failure in the cotter itself, as discussed
in (i); the tensile load for shearing failure is 338 kN.

Problem 3.3 A lever is keyed to a shaft 4 cm in diameter, the width of the key being 1.25 cm
and its length 5 cm. What load P can be applied at an arm of a = 1 m if the
average shearing stress in the key is not to exceed 60 MN/m’?

Solution

The torque applied to the shaft is Pa. If this is resisted by a shearing force F on the plane ad of the
key, then

Fr = Pa

where r is the radius of the shaft. Then

Complementary shearing stress 71
Foam = (0.02) = 350P

The area resisting shear in the key is

A = 0.0125 x 0.050 = 0.625 x 10° m?

The permissible shearing force on the plane ab of the key is then

F = tA = (60 x 10%) (0.625 x 10%) = 37.5 kN

The permissible value of P is then

p- -£ - 750N

3.3 Complementary shearing stress

Let us return now to the consideration of the block shown in Figure 3.1. We have seen that
horizontal planes, such as ab, are subjected to shearing stresses. In fact the state of stress is rather
more complex than we have supposed, because for rotational equilibrium of the whole block an
external couple is required to balance the couple due to the shearing forces F. Suppose the material
of the block is divided into a number of rectangular elements, as shown by the full lines of Figure
3.5, Under the actions of the shearing forces F, which together constitute a couple, the elements
will tend to take up the positions shown by the broken lines in Figure 3.5. It will be seen that there
is a tendency for the vertical faces of the elements to slide over each other. Actually the ends of
the elements do not slide over each other in this way, but the tendency to so do shows that the
shearing stress in horizontal planes is accompanied by shearing stresses in vertical planes
perpendicular to the applied shearing forces. This is true of all cases of shearing action: a given
shearing stress acting on one plane is always accompanied by a complementary shearing stress on
planes at right angles to the plane on which the given stress acts.

Figure 3.5 Tendency for a set of disconnected blocks
to rotate when shearing forces are applied.

Consider now the equilibrium of one of the elementary blocks of Figure 3.5. Let t,, be the
shearing stress on the horizontal faces of the element, and t,, the complementary shearing stress”

>Notice that the first suffix x shows the direction, the second the plane on which the stress acts; thus t,, acts in
direction of x axis on planes y = constant.

on vertical faces of the element, Figure 3.6. Suppose a is the length of the element, b its height,
and that it has unit thickness. The total shearing force on the upper and lower faces is then

Ty Xaxl = at,
while the total shearing force on the end faces is
Ty %bx1 = bt,
For rotational equilibrium of the element we then have
(at,,) x b = (dt,,) xa

and thus

Figure 3.6 Complementary shearing stresses over the faces
of a block when they are connected.

We see then that, whenever there is a shearing stress over a plane passing through a given line,
there must be an equal complementary shearing stress on a plane perpendicular to the given plane,
and passing through the given line. The directions of the two shearing stresses must be either both
towards, or both away from, the line of intersection of the two planes in which they act.

It is extremely important to appreciate the existence of the complementary shearing stress, for

its necessary presence has a direct effect on the maximum stress in the material, as we shall see
later in Chapter 5.

Complementary shearing stress 73
3.4 Shearing strain

Shearing stresses in a material give rise to shearing strains. Consider a rectangular block of
material, Figure 3.7, subjected to shearing stresses t in one plane. The shearing stresses distort the
rectangular face of the block into a parallelogram. If the right-angles at the corners of the face
change by amounts 7, then y is the shearing strain. The angle y is measured in radians, and is non-
dimensional therefore.

Figure 3.7 Shearing strain in a rectangular block; small values of y lead
to a negligible change of volume in shear straining.

For many materials shearing strain is linearly proportional to shearing stress within certain limits.
This linear dependence is similar to the case of direct tension and compression. Within the limits
of proportionality
t= G, (3.3)

where G is the shearing modulus or modulus of rigidity, and is similar to Young's modulus E£, for
direct tension and compression. For most materials E is about 2.5 times greater than G.

It should be noted that no volume changes occur as a result of shearing stresses acting alone.
In Figure 3.7 the volume of the strained block is approximately equal to the volume of the original
rectangular prism if the angular strain y is small.

3.5 Strain energy due to shearing actions

In shearing the rectangular prism of Figure 3.7, the forces acting on the upper and lower faces
undergo displacements. Work is done, therefore, during these displacements. If the strains are
kept within the elastic limit the work done is recoverable, and is stored in the form of strain energy.
Suppose all edges of the prism of Figure 3.7 are of unit length; then the prism has unit volume, and
the shearing forces on the sheared faces are t. Now suppose t is increased by a small amount,
causing a small increment of shearing strain dy. The work done on the prism during this small
change is t5y, as the force t moves through a distance 5y. The total work done in producing a
shearing strain y is then

Shearing stress

While the material remains elastic, we have from equation (3.3) that t = Gy, and the work done

4 Joints and connections

4.1 importance of connections

Many engineering structures and machines consist of components suitably connected through
carefully designed joints. In metallic materials, these joints may take a number of different forms,
as for example welded joints, bolted joints and riveted joints. In general, such joints are stressed
in complex ways, and it is not usually possible to calculate stresses accurately because of the
geometrical discontinuities in the region of a joint. For this reason, good design of connections is
a mixture of stress analysis and experience of the behaviour of actual joints; this is particularly true
of connections subjected to repeated loads.

Bolted joints are widely used in structural steel work and recently the performance of such
joints has been greatly improved by the introduction of high-tensile, friction-grip bolts. Welded
joints are widely used in steel structures, as for example, in ship construction. Riveted joints are
still widely used in aircraft-skin construction in light-alloy materials. Epoxy resin glues are often
used in the aeronautical field to bond metals.

4.2 Modes of failure of simple bolted and riveted joints

One or the simplest types of joint between two plates of material is a bolted or riveted lap joint,

Modes of failure of simple bolted and riveted joints 77

We shall discuss the forms of failure of the joint assuming it is bolted, but the analysis can be
extended in principle to the case ofa riveted connection. Consider a joint between two wide plates,
Figure 4.1; suppose the plates are each of thickness ¢, and that they are connected together with a
single line of bolts, giving a total overlap of breadth 2a. Suppose also that the bolts are each of
diameter d, and that their centres are a distance b apart along the line of bolts; the line of bolts is
a distance a from the edge of each plate. It is assumed that a bolt fills a hole, so that the holes in
the plates are also of diameter d.

We consider all possible simple modes of failure when each plate carries a tensile load of P per
unit width of plate:

Figure 4.2 Failure by shearing of the bolts.

(1) The bolts may fail by shearing, as shown in Figure 4.2; if t, is the maximum shearing stress
the bolts will withstand, the total shearing force required to shear a bolt is

(5) The plates may fail due to the development of large tensile stresses in the regions of points
such as f, Figure 4.6. The failing load in this condition is difficult to estimate, and we do not
attempt the calculation at this stage.

In riveted joints it is found from tests on mild-steel plates and rivets that if the centre of a rivet hole
is not less than 1'4 times the rivet hole diameter from the edge of the plate, then failure of the plate

by shearing, as discussed in (4) and (5), does not occur. Thus, if for mild-steel plates and rivets,

a 2 1.5d (4.5)

80 Joints and connections

we can disregard the modes of failure discussed in (4) and (5). In the case of wrought aluminium
alloys, the corresponding value of a is

a > 2d (4.6)

We have assumed, in discussing the modes of failure, that all load applied to the two plates of
Figure 4.1 is transmitted in shear through the bolts or rivets. This is so only if there is a negligible
frictional force between the two plates. If hot-driven rivets are used, appreciable frictional forces
are set up on cooling; these forces play a vital part in the behaviour of the connection. With cold-
driven rivets the frictional force is usually small, and may be neglected.

Problem 4.1 Two steel plates, each 1 cm thick, are connected by riveting them between
cover plates each 0.6 cm thick. The rivets are 1.6 cm diameter. The tensile
stress in the plates must not exceed 140 MN/m’, and the shearing stress in the
rivets must not exceed 75 MN/m’. Find the proportions of the joint so that it
shall be equally strong in shear and tension, and estimate the bearing pressure
between the rivets and the plates.

Solution

Suppose b is the rivet pitch, and that P is the tensile load per metre carried by the connection. Then
the tensile load on one rivet is Pb. The cover plates, taken together, are thicker than the main
plates, and may be disregarded therefore, in the strength calculations. We imagine there is no
restriction on the distance from the rivets to the extreme edges of the main plates and cover plates;
we may disregard then any possibility of shearing or tensile failure on the free edges of the plates.

There are then two possible modes of failure:

() Tensile failure of the main plates may occur on sections such as aa. The area resisting
tension is

0.010 (b - 0.016) m’

Efficiency of a connection 81

The permissible tensile load is, therefore,
Pb = (140 x 10°) [0.010 (b - 0.016)] N per rivet

(2) The rivets may fail by shearing. The area of each rivet is
=(0.016)’ = 0201 x 103 m?

The permissible load per rivet is then
Pb = 2(75 x 10°) (0.201 x 10°) N

as each rivet is in double shear.

If the joint is equally strong in tension and shear , we have, from (1) and (2),

(140 x 10°) [0.010 (b - 0.016)] = 2(75 x 10°) (0.201 x 107%)

This gives
b = 0.038m

Now
Pb = 2(75 x 10°) (0.201 x 10°’) = 30.2 KN

The average bearing pressure between the main plates and rivets is

30.2 x 10°

————_—— = 189 MN/m?
(0.016) (0.010)

4.3 Efficiency of a connection

After analysing the connection of Figure 4.1, suppose we find that in the weakest mode of failure
the carrying capacity of the joint is P,. If the two plates were continuous through the connection,
that is, if there were no overlap or bolts, the strength of the plates in tension would be

Pau = 6 ult

where 6,,, is the ultimate tensile stress of the material of the plates. The ratio

n= o — _*0 (4.7)

82 Joints and connections
is known as the efficiency of the connection; clearly, n defines the extent to which the strength of

the connection attains the full strength of the continuous plates. Joint efficiencies are also
described in Chapter 6.

Problem 4.2 What is the efficiency of the joint of Problem 4.1?

Solution

The permissible tensile load per rivet is 30.2 kN. For a continuous joint the tensile load which
could be carried by a 3.8 cm width of main plate is

(0.038) (0.010) (140 x10) = 53.2 kN

Then

n = 302. 0.57, or 57%

53.2

4.4 Group-bolted and -riveted joints

When two members are connected by cover plates bolted or riveted in the manner shown in Figure
4.7, the joint is said to be group-bolted or -riveted.

The greatest efficiency of the joint shown in Figure 4.7 is obtained when the bolts or rivets are
re-arranged in the form shown in Figure 4.8, where it is supposed six bolts or rivets are required
each side of the join. The loss of cross-section in the main members, on the line a, is that due to
one bolt or rivet hole. Ifthe load is assumed to be equally distributed among the bolts or rivets,
the bolt or rivet on the line a will take one-sixth of the total load, so that the tension in the main
plates, across b, will be 5/6ths of the total.

Figure 4.7 A group-bolted or -riveted joitu.

Eccentric loading of bolted and riveted connections 83

Figure 4.8 Joint with tapered cover plates.

But this section is reduced by two bolt or rivet holes, so that, relatively, it is as strong as the section
a, and so on: the reduction of the nett cross-section of the main plates increases as the load carried
by these plates decreases. Thus a more efficient joint is obtained than when the bolts or rivets are
arranged as in Figure 4.7.

4.5 Eccentric loading of bolted and riveted connections

Structural connections are commonly required to transmit moments as well as axial forces. Figure
4.9 shows the connection between a bracket and a stanchion; the bracket is attached to the
stanchion through a system of six bolts or rivets, a vertical load P is applied to the bracket.
Suppose the bolts or rivets are all of the same diameter. The load P is then replaced by a parallel
load P applied to the centroid C of the rivet system, together with a moment Pe about the centroid
Figure 4.9(ii); e is the perpendicular distance from C onto the line of action of P.

Figure 4.9 Eccentrically loaded connection leading to a bending
action on the group of bolts, as well as a shearing action.

Consider separately the effects of the load P at C and the moment Pe. We assume that P is
distributed equally amongst the bolts or rivets as a shearing force parallel to the line of action of P.

84 Joints and connections
The moment Pe is assumed to induce a shearing force F in any bolt or rivet perpendicular to the

line joining C to the bolt or rivet; moreover the force F is assumed to be proportional to the
distance r from the bolt or rivet to C, (Figure 4.10).

Figure 4.10 Assumed forces on the bolts.

For equilibrium we have

Pe= 2Fr

If F= kr, where k is constant for all rivets, then
Pe= k=Ir

Thus, we have

F-kr=—>r (4.8)

The resultant force on a bolt or rivet is then the vector sum of the forces due to P and Pe.

Problem 4.3 A bracket is bolted to a vertical stanchion and carries a vertical load of 50 KN.
Assuming that the total shearing stress in a bolt is proportional to the relative
displacement of the bracket and the stanchion in the neighbourhood of the bolt,
find the load carried by each of the bolts. (Cambridge)

For bolt b,
r= bC= aC = 0.0902 m
For bolts d and f,
r= 0.050m
For bolts g and h,
r= gC = aC= 0.0902m
Then

All force vectors are in KN. The resultant loads on the bolts are then as follows:

4.6 Welded connections

Some metals used in engineering—such as steel and aluminium—can be deposited in a molten
state between two components to form a joint, which is then called a welded connection. The
metal deposited to form the joint is called the weld. Two types of weld are in common use, the

Welded connections 87

butt weld and the fillet weld; Figure 4.11 shows two plates connected by a butt weld; the plates are
tapered at the joint to give sufficient space for the weld material. If the plates carry a tensile load
the weld material carries largely tensile stresses. Figure 4.12 shows two plates connected by fillet
welds; if the joint carries a tensile load the welds carry largely shearing stresses, although the state
of stress in the welds is complex, and tensile stresses may also be present. Fillet welds of the type
indicated in Figure 4.12 transmit force between the two plates by shearing actions within the welds;
if the weld has the triangular cross-section shown in Figure 4.13(i), the shearing stress is greatest
across the narrowest section of the weld, having a thickness t//2. This section is called the throat
of the weld. In Figure 4.13(ii), the weld has the same thickness ¢ at all sections. To estimate
approximately the strength of the welds in Figure 4.13 it is assumed that failure of the welds takes
place by shearing across the throats of the welds.

Suppose the throat thickness of the fillet-welds is ¢. Then the longitudinal welds carry a shearing

tA = (75 x 10°) (0.075 x 2f)= (11.25 x 109) tN

The transverse welds carry a shearing force

tA = (100 10%) (0.050 x 2#)= (10 x 10°) tN

Then
(11.25 x 10°) ¢+ (10 x 10°) t= 100 x 10°

Welded connections under bending actions 89

Solution

The sections of the plates between the welds will stretch by approximately the same amounts; thus,
these sections will suffer the same strains and, as they are the same materials, they will also suffer
the same stresses. If a shearing force F,, is transmitted by the one weld and a shearing force F,, by
the other, then the tensile force over the section A in the one plate is F., and over the section B in
the other plate is F,. If the plates have the same breadth and are to carry equal tensile stresses over
the sections A and B, we have

method of analysis similar to that for bolted and riveted connections discussed in Section 4.5. We
assume that the shearing stress in the weld is proportional to the distance of any part of the weld
from the centroid of the weld. Consider, for example, a plate which is welded to a stanchion and
which carries a bending moment M in the plane of the welds, Figure 4.14. We suppose the fillet-
welds are of uniform thickness ¢ around the parameter of a rectangle of sides a and b. At any point
of the weld we take the shearing stress, t, as acting normal to the line joining that point to the
centroid C of the weld. If 54 is an elemental area of weld at any point, then

5 ___Analysis of stress and strain

5.1 Introduction

Up to the present we have confined our attention to considerations of simple direct and shearing
stresses. But in most practical problems we have to deal with combinations of these stresses.

The strengths and elastic properties of materials are determined usually by simple tensile and
compressive tests. How are we to make use of the results of such tests when we know that stress
in a given practical problem is compounded from a tensile stress in one direction, a compressive
stress in some other direction, and a shearing stress in a third direction? Clearly we cannot make
tests of a material under all possible combinations of stress to determine its strength. It is essential,
in fact, to study stresses and strains in more general terms; the analysis which follows should be
regarded as having a direct and important bearing on practical strength problems, and is not merely
a display of mathematical ingenuity.

5.2 Shearing stresses in a tensile test specimen

A long uniform bar, Figure 5.1, has a rectangular cross-section of area A. The edges of the bar are
parallel to perpendicular axes Ox, Oy, Oz. The bar is uniformly stressed in tension in the x-
direction, the tensile stress on a cross-section of the bar parallel to Ox being o,. Consider the
stresses acting on an inclined cross-section of the bar; an inclined plane is taken at an angle 6 to
the yz-plane. The resultant force at the end cross-section of the bar is acting parallel to Ox.

P = Ao,

Figure 5.1 Stresses on an inclined plane through a tensile test piece.

For equilibrium the resultant force parallel to Ox on an inclined cross-section is also P = Ao,. At
the inclined cross-section in Figure 5.1, resolve the force Ao, into two components—one

perpendicular, and the other tangential, to the inclined cross-section, the latter component acting
parallel to the xz-plane. These two components have values, respectively, of

Ao, cos § and Ao, sin 8
The area of the inclined cross-section is
A sec 8

so that the normal and tangential stresses acting on the inclined cross-section are

Ao , cosé >
o = —— =o, cos 8 5.1
A sec8 (6.1)
A in8
12 ou o, cos@ sin® (5.2)
A sec®

o is the direct stress and t the shearing stress on the inclined plane. It should be noted that the
stresses on an inclined plane are not simply the resolutions of o, perpendicular and tangential to
that plane; the important point in Figure 5.1 is that the area of an inclined cross-section of the bar
is different from that of a normal cross-section. The shearing stress t may be written in the form

t= 6, cos@ sind = 40, sin26

At @ = 0° the cross-section is perpendicular to the axis of the bar, and t = 0; 1 increases as 0
increases until it attains a maximum of 4 6, at 6 = 45°; 1 then diminishes as 0 increases further
until it is again zero at @ = 90°. Thus on any inclined cross-section of a tensile test-piece, shearing
stresses are always present; the shearing stresses are greatest on planes at 45° to the longitudinal
axis of the bar.

Problem 5.1 A bar of cross-section 2.25 cm by 2.25 cm is subjected to an axial pull of
20 KN. Calculate the normal stress and shearing stress on a plane the normal
to which makes an angle of 60° with the axis of the bar, the plane being
perpendicular to one face of the bar.

We have 0 = 60°, P= 20kNandA = 0.507 x10? m’. Then

5.3 Strain figures in mild steel; Liider's lines

Ifa tensile specimen of mild steel is well polished and then stressed, it will be found that, when the
specimen yields, a pattern of fine lines appears on the polished surface; these lines intersect roughly
at right-angles to each other, and at 45° approximately to the longitudinal axis of the bar; these
lines were first observed by Liider in 1854. Liider's lines on a tensile specimen of mild steel are
shown in Figure 5.2. These strain figures suggest that yielding of the material consists of slip along
the planes of greatest shearing stress; a single line represents a slip band, containing a large number
of metal crystals.

Figure 5.2 Liider's lines in the yielding of a steel bar in tension.

5.4 Failure of materials in compression

Shearing stresses are also developed in a bar under uniform compression. The failure of some
materials in compression is due to the development of critical shearing stresses on planes inclined
to the direction of compression. Figure 5.3 shows two failures of compressed timbers; failure is
due primarily to breakdown in shear on planes inclined to the direction of compression.

General two-dimensional stress system 97

Figure 5.3 Failures of compressed specimens of timber,
showing breakdown of the material in shear.

5.5 General two-dimensional stress system

A two-dimensional stress system is one in which the stresses at any point in a body act in the same
plane. Consider a thin rectangular block of material, abcd, two faces of which are parallel to the
xy-plane, Figure 5.4. A two-dimensional state of stress exists if the stresses on the remaining four
faces are parallel to the xy-plane. In general, suppose the forces acting on the faces are P, Q, R,
S, parallel to the xy-plane, Figure 5.4. Each of these forces can be resolved into components P,,
P, etc., Figure 5.5. The perpendicular components give rise to direct stresses, and the tangential
components to shearing stresses.

The system of forces in Figure 5.5 is now replaced by its equivalent system of stresses; the
rectangular block of Figure 5.6 is in uniform state of two-dimensional stress; over the two faces
parallel to Ox are direct and shearing stresses 6, and t,,, respectively. The thickness is assumed
to be 1 unit of length, for convenience, the other sides having lengths a and 5. Equilibrium of the
block in the x- and y-directions is already ensured; for rotational equilibrium of the block in the xy-
plane we must have

[t, (@ x 1)] = b= [t,, (6 x1] xa

Then the shearing stresses on perpendicular planes are equal and complementary as we found in
the simpler case of pure shear in Section 3.3.

5.6 Stresses on an inclined plane

Consider the stresses acting on an inclined plane of the uniformly stressed rectangular block of
Figure 5.6; the inclined plane makes an angle 8 with O,, and cuts off a ‘triangular’ block, Figure
5.7. The length of the hypotenuse is c, and the thickness of the block is taken again as one unit of
length, for convenience. The values of direct stress, o, and shearing stress, t, on the inclined plane
are found by considering equilibrium of the triangular block. The direct stress acts along the
normal to the inclined plane. Resolve the forces on the three sides of the block parallel to this

Stresses on an inclined plane 99
normal: then
@ (c.1) = 6, (c cos8 cos8) + «, (c sin® sin@) + t,, (c cos® sin8) + t,, (c sin® cos6)
This gives
6 = 6, cos’ @ +6, sin’ 6 + 21, sin @ cos 8 (5.4)

Now resolve forces in a direction parallel to the inclined plane:

t.(c 1) = -o, (c cos6 sin8) + 6, (¢ sin® cos@) + T,, (c cos® cos8) ~T,, (c sin® sin8)
This gives
T = -6, cos6 sin® + o, sin® cos6 + T,(cos’0 - sin’6) (5.5)

The expressions for o and t are written more conveniently in the forms:
6 = 'A(o, + G,) + ‘A(G, - 6,) cos26 + T,, sin20 (5.6)
T= -'A(o, ~ 6,) sin26 + t,, cos20 (5.7)

100 Analysis of stress and strain

In a two-dimensional stress system there are thus two planes, separated by 90°, on which the
shearing stress is zero. These planes are called the principal planes, and the corresponding values
of o are called the principal stresses. The direct stress o is a maximum when

& = -(c, - 6,) sin26 + 21, cos28 = 0
that is, when
2T
tan20 = =
G, - SG,

which is identical with equation (5.8), defining the directions of the principal stresses; thus the
principal stresses are also the maximum and minimum direct stresses in the material.

5.7 Values of the principal stresses

The directions of the principal planes are given by equation (5.8). For any two-dimensional stress
system, in which the values of 6,, 6, and t,, are known, tan26 is calculable; two values of 6,
separated by 90°, can then be found. The principal stresses are then calculated by substituting
these vales of 6 into equation (5.6).

Alternatively, the principal stresses can be calculated more directly without finding the
principal planes. Earlier we defined a principal plane as one on which there is no shearing stress;

in Figure 5.8 it is assumed that no shearing stress acts on a plane at an angle 8 to Oy.

Figure 5.8 A principal stress acting on an inclined plane;
there is no shearing stress t associated with a principal stress o.

For equilibrium of the triangular block in the x-direction,
a(c cos8) - 6, (c cos8) = 1,, (c sin®)

and so
o - 6, = T,, tan8 (5.10)

Maximum shearing stress 101
For equilibrium of the block in the y-direction
o (c sin8) - 6, (c sin®) = t,, (c cos0)
and thus
6 - G, = T,, cotd (5.11)

On eliminating 6 between equations (5.10) and (5.11); by multiplying these equations together, we
get

_ 2
(6 - 6,)(6-5,) = T,,
This equation is quadratic in o; the solutions are

-d 2 2 _ . .
5, = > (6, + 6) + 4 (o, - oy) +4, = maximum principal stress

(5.12)

2
6, = 4(6,+ G,) - 4+ (ox- oy) +47, = minimum principal stress

which are the values of the principal stresses; these stresses occur on mutually perpendicular
planes.

5.8 Maximum shearing stress

The principal planes define directions of zero shearing stress; on some intermediate plane the
shearing stress attains a maximum value. The shearing stress is given by equation (5.7); t attains
a maximum value with respect to @ when

dt .
- = -(6, - 6,) cos2@ - 21, sin26 = 0
ie., when
2T
cotz6 = -
5, - 6,

The planes of maximum shearing stress are inclined then at 45° to the principal planes. On
substituting this value of cot 26 into equation (5.7), the maximum numerical value of t is

102 Maximum shearing stress

tm = 4 Fle2-29)) + feo) (5.13)

But from equations (5.12),

where o, and o, are the principal stresses of the stress system. Then by adding together the two
equations on the right hand side, we get

2 2
2 [4(6x-sy)| +[r| =6,-6,
and equation (5.13) becomes

Tmax = (01 - 52) (5.14)

The maximum shearing stress is therefore half the difference between the principal stresses of the
system.

Solution

Now, we have

4(o,+6,)=+ (60.0 - 45.0) = 7.5 MNim*

4(o,-6,)=+4 (60.0+45.0) = 52.5 MN/m

Tmax =

This maximum shearing stress occurs on planes at 45° to those of the principal stresses.

5.9 Mohr's circle of stress

A geometrical interpretation of equations (5.6) and (5.7) leads to a simple method of stress
analysis. Now, we have found already that

o= +(>- +o,) + +(c, —9,)cos20 +T,, sin20

-—l :
T= -4(c, - s,)sin26 + t,, cos20

Take two perpendicular axes Oo, Ot, Figure 5.9; on this co-ordinate system set off the point having
co-ordinates (6,, t,,) and (6,, — 1,,), corresponding to the known stresses in the x- and y-directions.
The line PQ joining these two points is bisected by the Oo axis at a point O’. With a centre at O’,
construct a circle passing through P and Q. The stresses o and t ona plane at an angle @ to Oy are
found by setting off a radius of the circle at an angle 20 to PO, Figure 5.9; 20 is measured in a
clockwise direction from O’ P.

stress states (6,, t,,) and (6,, — 1,,) respectively, and are diametrically opposite;
the state of stress (a, t) on a plane inclined at an angle 6 to Oy is given by the point R.

The co-ordinates of the point R(o, t) give the direct and shearing stresses on the plane. We may
write the above equations in the forms

o~ (0.4 °,) = 4(s.- oy) cos20 + T,, sin20

stresses are defined by the points 4 and B, at whicht = 0. The maximum shearing stress, which
is given by the point C, is clearly the radius of the circle.

Strains in an inclined direction 109

5.10 Strains in an inclined direction

For two-dimensional system of strains the direct and shearing strains in any direction are known
if the direct and shearing strains in two mutually perpendicular directions are given. Consider a
rectangular element of material, OABC, in the xy-plane, Figure 5.14, it is required to find the direct
and shearing strains in the direction of the diagonal OB, when the direct and shearing strains in the
directions Ox, Oy are given. Suppose e, is the strain in the direction Ox, ¢, the strain in the
direction Oy, and y,, the shearing strain relative to Ox and Oy.

& COs

Figure 5.14 Strains in an inclined direction; strains in the directions O, and O, and
defined by ¢,, €, and y,,, lead to strains €, y along the inclined direction OB.

All the strains are considered to be small; in Figure 5.14, if the diagonal OB of the rectangle is
taken to be of unit length, the sides OA, OB are of lengths sin®, cos®, respectively, in which 0 is
the angle OB makes with Ox. In the strained condition OA extends a small amount €, sin8, OC
extends a small amount e, cos0, and due to shearing strain OA rotates through a small angle y,,.

110 Analysis of stress and strain
If the point B moves to point B’, the movement of B parallel to Ox is
€, cos8 + y,, sin@
and the movement parallel to Oy is
€, sin@
Then the movement of B parallel to OB is
(e. cos8 + yx, sin6) cos®8 + (e, sin6) sin®
Since the strains are small, this is equal to the extension of the OB in the strained condition; but OB

is of unit length, so that the extension is also the direct strain in the direction OB. If the direct
strain in the direction OB is denoted by e, then

€ = (c, cos8 + y,, sin6) cos8 +(e, sin®) sin8

This may be written in the form
€ = €, cos?O +e, sin? + Y xy sin® cosé
x y xy
and also in the form
— = +(e, + e,)+ +(e, - é, ) cos20 + +74, sin20 (5.16)

This is similar in form to equation (5.6), defining the direct stress on an inclined plane; ¢, and E,
replace 6, and o,, respectively, and '“y,, replaces T,,.

To evaluate the shearing strain in the direction OB we consider the displacements of the point
D, the foot of the perpendicular from C to OB, in the strained condition, Figure 5.10. The point
D, is displaced to a point D’; we have seen that OB extends an amount ¢, so that OD extends an
amount

The amount by which the angle ODC diminishes during straining is the shearing strain y in the

On substituting for ¢ from equation (5.16) we have

which may be written

The direct and shearing strains in an inclined direction are given by relations which are similar to
equations (5.6) and (5.7) for the direct and shearing stresses on an inclined plane. This suggests
that the strains in any direction can be represented graphically in a similar way to the stress system.

An important feature of this strain analysis is that we have not assumed that the strains are elastic;
we have taken them to be small, however, with this limitation Mohr's circle of strain is applicable
to both elastic and inelastic problems.

5.12 Elastic stress—strain relations

When a point of a body is acted upon by stresses 6, and o, in mutually perpendicular directions
the strains are found by superposing the strains due to o, and o, acting separately.

These elastic strains are small, and the state of strain due to both stresses 6, and o,, acting

a shearing stress T,, is present in addition to the direct stresses o, and o,, as in Figure 5.17, the
shearing stress T,, is assumed to have no effect on the direct strains ¢, and ¢, caused by o, and o,.

Figure 5.17 Shearing strain in a two-dimensional system.

Similarly, the direct stresses o, and o, are assumed to have no effect on the shearing strain y,, due
tot,,. When shearing stresses are present, as well as direct stresses, there is therefore an additional
stress-strain relation having the form in which G is the shearing modulus.

Then, in addition to equations (5.19) we have the relation

t, = GY, (5.20)

5.13 Principal stresses and strains

We have seen that in a two-dimensional system of stresses there are always two mutually
perpendicular directions in which there are no shearing stresses; the direct stresses on these planes
were referred to as principal stresses, 6, and o,. As there are no shearing stresses in these two
mutually perpendicular directions, there are also no shearing strains; for the principal directions
the corresponding direct strains are given by

Ee

(5.21)

Ee, 6, - VO,

The direct strains, €,, €,, are the principal strains already discussed in Mohr's circle of strain. It
follows that the principal strains occur in directions parallel to the principal stresses.

Relation between £, G and v 115

5.14 Relation between E, G and v

Consider an element of material subjected to a tensile stress 6, in one direction together with a
compressive stress G, in a mutually perpendicular direction, Figure 5.18(i). The Mohr's circle for
this state of stress has the form shown in Figure 5.18(ii); the circle of stress has a centre at the
origin and a radius of oy. The direct and shearing stresses on an inclined plane are given by the co-
ordinates of a point on the circle; in particular we note that there is no direct stress when 20 = 90°,
that is, when 8 = 45° in Figure 5.18(i).

stresses of equal magnitude, but acting in mutually perpendicular directions.
(ii) Mohr's circle of stress for this system.

Moreover when @ = 45°, the shearing stress on this plane is of magnitude 6). We conclude then
that a state of equal and opposite tension and compression, as indicated in Figure 5.18(i), is
equivalent, from the stress standpoint, to a condition of simple shearing in directions at 45°, the
shearing stresses having the same magnitudes as the direct stresses 6, (Figure 5.19). This system
of stresses is called pure shear.

and hence

E = 2G(1 +v) (5.24)

Thus v can be calculated from measured values E and G.

the form

Problem 5.6 A thin sheet of material is subjected to a tensile stress of 80 MN/m’, ina certain
direction. One surface of the sheet is polished, and on this surface fine lines are
ruled to form a square of side 5 cm, one diagonal of the square being parallel
to the direction of the tensile stresses. If E = 200 GN/m’, and v = 0.3,
estimate the alteration in the lengths of the sides of the square, and the changes
in the angles at the comers of the square.

Solution

5.15 Strain ‘rosettes’

To determine the stresses in a material under practical loading conditions, the strains are measured
by means of small gauges; many types of gauges have been devised, but perhaps the most
convenient is the electrical resistance strain gauge, consisting of a short length of fine wire which
is glued to the surface of the material. The resistance of the wire changes by small amounts as the
wire is stretched, so that as the surface of the material is strained the gauge indicates a change of
resistance which is measurable on a Wheatstone bridge. The lengths of wire resistance strain
gauges can be as small as 0.4 mm, and they are therefore extremely useful in measuring local
strains.

Three dimensional stress systems 127
5.17 Three-dimensional stress systems

In any two-dimensional stress system we found there were two mutually perpendicular directions
in which only direct stresses, 6, and o,, acted; these were called the principal stresses. In any three-
dimensional stress system we can always find three mutually perpendicular directions in which
only direct stresses, 6,, 6, and o, in Figure 5.26, are acting. No shearing stresses act on the faces
of a rectangular block having its edges parallel to the axes 1, 2 and 3 in Figure 5.26. These direct
stresses are again called principal stresses.

If 6, > 6, > 6, then the three-dimensional stress system can be represented in the form of
Mohr's circles, as shown in Figure 5.27. Circle a passes through the points 6, and o, on the o-axis,
and defines all states of stress on planes parallel to the axis 3, Figure 5.26, but inclined to axis |
and axis 2, respectively.

on any plane through the point must correspond to a
point P lying on or between the three circles.

128 Analysis of stress and strain

Circle c, having a diameter (0, - 0,), embraces the two smaller circles. For a plane inclined to
all three axes the stresses are defined by a point such as P within the shaded area in Figure 5.27.
The maximum shearing stress is

1
Tenax = 5 - 65)

and occurs on a plane parallel to the axis 2.

From our discussion of three-dimensional stress systems we note that when one of the
principal stresses, o, say, is zero, Figure 5.28, we have a two-dimensional system of stresses o,,
o,; the maximum shearing stresses in the planes 1~2, 2-3, 3-1 are, respectively,

1 1 1
zi - G55 5%

Suppose, initially, that o, and 6, are both tensile and that o, > o,; then the greatest of the three
maximum shearing stresses is 4% 6, which occurs in the 2-3 plane. If, on the other hand, o, is
tensile and o, is compressive, the greatest of the maximum shearing stresses is 4 (0, - 6,) and
occurs in the 1~2 plane.

We conclude from this that the presence of a zero stress in a direction perpendicuiar to a two-
dimensional stress system may have an important effect on the maximum shearing stresses in the
material and cannot be disregarded therefore. The direct strains corresponding to o,, 6, and o,
for an elastic material are found by taking account of the Poisson ratio effects in the three
directions; the principal strains in the directions 1, 2 and 3 are, respectively,

Volumetric strain in a material under hydrostatic pressure 129
5.18 Volumetric strain in a material under hydrostatic pressure

A material under the action of equal compressive stresses o in three mutually perpendicular
directions, Figure 5.29, is subjected to a hydrostatic pressure, 6. The term hydrostatic is used
because the material is subjected to the same stresses as would occur if it were immersed in a fluid
at a considerable depth.

If the material remains elastic under hydrostatic pressure, the strain in each of the three mutually

because there are two Poisson ratio effects on the strain in any of the three directions. If we
consider a cube of material having sides of unit length in the unstrained condition, the volume of
the strained cube is

(1 - e)

Now ¢ is small, so that this may be written approximately

1 - 3e

The change in volume of a unit volume is then

which is therefore the volumetric strain. Then equation (5.55) gives the relationship

We should expect the volume of a material to diminish under a hydrostatic pressure. In general,
if K is always positive, we must have

Then Poisson's ratio is always less than 4. For plastic strains of a metallic material there is a
negligible change of volume, the Poisson's ratio is equal to '4, approximately.

5.20 Isotropic, orthotropic and anisotropic

A material is said to be isotropic when its material properties are the same in all directions. An
orthotropic material is said to exhibit symmetric material properties about three mutually
perpendicular planes. In two dimensions, typical orthotropic materials are in the form of many
composites. An anisotropic material is a material that exhibits different material properties in all
directions.

5.21 Fibre composites

Fibre composites are very important for structures which require a large strength:weight ratio,
especially when the weight of the structure is ata premium. They are likely to become even more
important in the 21st century and will probably revolutionise the design and construction of aircraft,
rockets, submarines and warships.

To represent the elasticity of a composite, tensile modulus is used in preference to Young's
modulus of elasticity. Additionally, as most composites are usually assumed to be of orthotropic
form, their material properties in one direction, (say) ‘x’ are likely to be different to a direction
perpendicular to the ‘x’ direction, (say) ‘y’. Composites usually consist of several layers of fibre
matting, set in a resin, as shown by Figure 5.30. To gain maximum strength the layers of fibre
matting are laid in different directions. In this Chapter, the term /amina or ply will be used to
describe a single layer of the composite structure and the term laminate or composite will be used
to define the entire mixture of plies and resin.

5.24 Yielding of ductile materials under combined stresses

It was noted in Section 5.3 that when a polished bar of mild steel is loaded in tension, strain figures
are observable on the surface of the bar after the yield point has been exceeded. The figures take
the form of ‘lines’ inclined at about 45° to the axis of the bar; this direction corresponds to the
planes of maximum shearing stress in the bar; the ‘lines’ are, in fact, bands of metal crystals

Yielding of ductile materials under combined stresses

shearing over similar bands. That yielding takes place in this way suggests that the crystal
structure of the metal is relatively weak in shear; yielding takes the form of sliding of one crystal

plane over another, and not the tearing apart of two crystal planes.

This form of behaviour—yielding by a shearing action—is typical of ductile materials. We
note firstly that if a material is subjected to a hydrostatic pressure o, the three principal stresses o,,
6, and o, ina three-dimensional system are each equal to o. A state of stress of this sort exists in
a solid sphere of material subjected to an external pressure o, Figure 5.34. As the three principal
stresses are equal in magnitude, there are no shearing stresses in the material; if yielding is
governed by the presence of shearing on some planes in a material, then no yielding is theoretically

possible when the material is under hydrostatic pressure.

Figure 5.34 A solid sphere of material under hydrostatic pressure.

For a two-dimensional stress system one of the three principal stresses of a three-dimensional
system is zero. We consider now the yielding of a mild steel under different combinations of the
principal stresses, o, and o,, of a two-dimensional system; in discussing the problem we keep in

mind the presence of a zero stress perpendicular to the plane of 6, and o,, Figure 5.27.

146 Analysis of stress and strain

Suppose we conduct a simple tension test on the material; we may puto, = 0, and yielding occurs
when 6, = 4y, (say)

This yielding condition corresponds to the point A in Figure 5.35. If the material has similar
properties in tension and compression, yielding under a compressive stress 6, occurs when o, =
- Oy; this condition corresponds to the point C in Figure 5.35. We could, however, perform the
tension and compression tests in the direction of o,, Figure 5.35; if the material is isotropic —that
is, it has the same properties in all directions—yielding occurs at the yield stress o,; we can thus
derive points B and D in the yield diagram, Figure 5.35.

We consider now yielding of the material when both o, and o,, Figure 5.36, are present; we
shall assume that yielding of the mild steel occurs when the maximum shearing stress attains a
critical value; from the simple tensile test, the maximum shearing stress at yielding is

which we shall take as the critical value. Suppose that o, > o,, and that both principal stresses are
tensile; the maximum shearing stress is

and occurs in the 3-1 plane of Figure 5.36; t,,,, attains the critical value when
—6o, = 16. ors, = G
1 7 or 1 y
Thus, yielding for these stress conditions is unaffected by o,. In Figure 5.35, these stress
conditions are given by the line AH. If we consider similarly the case when o, and o, are both

tensile, but 6, > 0,, yielding occurs when 6, = oy, giving the line BH in Figure 5.35.

Yielding of ductile materials under combined stresses 147

But when a, is tensile and o, is compressive, Figure 5.36, the maximum shearing stress occurs in
the 1-2 plane, and has the value

Tinax = > (6, ~ 5.)

This corresponds to the line AD of Figure 5.36. Similarly, when o, is compressive and 6, is tensile,
yielding occurs when corresponding to the line BC of Figure 5.36.

G6, ~ 6, = Gy

The hexagon AHBCFD of Figure 5.36 is called a yield locus, because it defines all combinations
of o, and o, giving yielding of mild steel; for any state of stress within the hexagon the material
remains elastic; for this reason the hexagon is also sometimes called a yield envelope. The
criterion of yielding used in the derivation of the hexagon of Figure 5.36 was that of maximum
shearing stress; the use of this criterion was first suggested by Tresca in 1878.

Not all ductile metals obey the maximum shearing stress criterion; the yielding of some metals.
including certain steels and alloys of aluminium, is governed by a critical value of the strain energy
of distortion. For a two-dimensional stress system the strain energy of distortion per unit of
volume of the material is given by equation (5.83). In the simple tension test for which o, = 0,
say, yielding occurs when 6, = oy. The critical value of U, is therefore

U, = —|0; - 6,6, +o] = —|o, - a, (0) + 0 —
D 6G |! 1 °2 4 6G Y y | 6G
Then for other combinations of o, and o,, yielding occurs when
o - 6, G, + 6, = S, (5.83)

The yield locus given by this equation is an ellipse with major and minor axes inclined at 45° to
the directions of o, and o,, Figure 5.39. This locus was first suggested by von Mises in 1913.

For a three-dimensional system the yield locus corresponding to the strain energy of distortion
is of the form

6, - o,f + (6, - o,f + (Oo, - 6 = constant

This relation defines the surface of a cylinder of circular cross-section, with its central axis on the

When a material obeys the maximum sheaning stress criterion, the three-dimensional yield
locus is a regular hexagonal cylinder with its central axis on the line o, = 6, = 6, = 0, Figure
5.40. When o, is zero, the locus is an irregular hexagon, of the form already discussed in Figure
5.36.

The surfaces of the yield loci in Figures 5.40 and 5.41 extend indefinitely parallel to the line
6, = 0, = 6;, which we call the hydrostatic stress line. Hydrostatic stress itself cannot cause
yielding, and no yielding occurs at other stresses provided these fall within the cylinders of Figures

5.40 and 5.41.

Elastic breakdown and failure of brittle material 149

The problem with the maximum principal stress and maximum principal strain theories is that they
break down in the hydrostatic stress case; this is because under hydrostatic stress, failure does not
occur as there is no shear stress. It must be pointed out that under uniaxial tensile stress, all the
major theories give the same predictions for elastic failure, hence, all apply in the uniaxial case.
However, in the case of a ductile specimen under pure torsion, the maximum shear stress theory
predicts that yield occurs when the maximum shear reaches 0.5 o,, but in practice, yield occurs
when the maximum shear stress reaches 0.577 of the yield stress. This last condition is only
satisfied by the von Mises or distortion energy theory and for this reason, this theory is currently
very much in favour for ductile materials.

Another interpretation of the von Mises or distortion energy theory is that yield occurs when
the von Mises stress, namely o,,,, reaches yield.

In three dimensions, 6,,, is calculated as follows:

’ vm

Sum = GC ~ 92) +(0)- 93)" + (02 - 3) |/v2

(5.84)

In two-dimensions, 6, = 0, therefore equation (5.84) becomes:

(5.85)

5.25 Elastic breakdown and failure of brittle material

Unlike ductile materials the failure of brittle materials occurs at relatively low strains, and there
is little, or no, permanent yielding on the planes of maximum shearing stress.

Some brittle materials, such as cast iron and concrete, contain large numbers of holes and
microscopic cracks in their structures. These are believed to give rise to high stress concentrations,
thereby causing local failure of the material. These stress concentrations are likely to have a
greater effect in reducing tensile strength than compressive strength; a general characteristic of
brittle materials is that they are relatively weak in tension. For this reason elastic breakdown and
failure in a brittle material are governed largely by the maximum principal tensile stress; as an
example of the application of this criterion consider a concrete: in simple tension the breaking
stress is about 1.5 MN/m’, whereas in compression it is found to be about 30 MN/m’, or 20 times
as great; in pure shear the breaking stress would be of the order of 1.5 MN/m’, because the
principal stresses are of the same magnitude, and one of these stresses is tensile, Figure 5.42.
Cracking in the concrete would occur on planes inclined at 45° to the directions of the applied
shearing stresses.

5.26 Failure of composites

Accurate prediction of the failure of laminates is a much more difficult task than it is for steels and
aluminium alloys. The failure load of the laminate is also dependent on whether the laminate is
under in-plane loading, or bending or shear. Additionally, under compression, individual plies can
buckle through a microscopic form of beam-column buckling (see Chapter 18). In general, it is
better to depend on experimental data than purely on theories of elastic failure. Theories, however,
exist and Hill, Azzi and Tsai produced theories based on the von Mises theory of yield. One such
popular two-dimensional theory is the Azzi-Tsai theory, as follows:

2
6 6 Go Tt
Sp - tr, = | (5.86)

where X and Y are the uniaxial strengths related to 6, and 6, respectively and S is the shear strength
in the x—y directions, which are not principal planes.

For the isotropic case, where X = Y = a,andS = o,/ V3, equation (5.86) reduces to the von
Mises form:

2,2 _ +3u. =
6, + 6, - 6, 6, + 3, = OY

and when o, = 6,ando, = o,sothatt,_, = 0, we get

6, + 6, - 6, 6, = Gy, [See equation (5.85)]

6 _Thin shells under internal pressure

6.1 Thin cylindrical shell of circular cross-section

A problem in which combined stresses are present is that of a cylindrical shell under internal
pressure. Suppose a long circular shell is subjected to an internal pressure p, which may be due
to a fluid or gas enclosed within the cylinder, Figure 6.1. The internal pressure acting on the long
sides of the cylinder gives rise to a circumferential stress in the wall of the cylinder; if the ends of
the cylinder are closed, the pressure acting on these ends is transmitted to the walls of the cylinder,
thus producing a longitudinal stress in the walls.

Suppose r is the mean radius of the cylinder, and that its thickness ¢ is small compared with r.
Consider a unit length of the cylinder remote from the closed ends, Figure 6.2; suppose we cut this
unit length with a diametral plane, as in Figure 6.2. The tensile stresses acting on the cut sections
are 6,, acting circumferentially, and o,, acting longitudinally. There is an internal pressure p on

Then

(r/t) is very much greater than unity, p is small compared with o, and o,. The state of stress in the
wall of the cylinder approximates then to a simple two-dimensional system with principal stresses

Problem 6.2 If the ends of the cylinder in Problem 6.1 are closed by pistons sliding in the
cylinder, estimate the circumferential and longitudinal stresses.

Solution

The effect of taking the end pressure on sliding pistons is to remove the force on the cylinder
causing longitudinal stress. As in Problem 6.1, the circumferential stress is

6, = 71.8 MN/m?

but the longitudinal stress is zero.

Suppose the rivets are staggered on each side of the joint. Then a single rivet takes the
circumferential load associated with a % (0.090) = 0.045 m length of boiler. The load on a rivet
is

[529] (0.045) (08 x 10°) = 22.5 kN

Area of a rivet is

7 (002)° = 0.314 x 10° m?

The load of 22.5 KN is taken in double shear, and the shearing stress in the rivet is then
1
5 (22.5 x 10°) / (0.314 x 10°) = 35.8 MN/m’

The rivet holes in the plates give rise to a loss in plate width of 2 cm in each 9 cm of rivet line. The
effective area of boiler plate in a 9 cm length is then

(0.010) (0.090 - 0.020) = (0.010) (0.070) = 0.7x 10° m

The tensile load taken by this area is

Equations (6.1) and (6.2) are for determining stress in perfect thin-walled circular cylindrical shells.
If, however, the circular cylinder is fabricated, so that its joints are weaker than the rest of the

6.2 Thin spherical shell

This is opposed by a tensile stress o in the walls of the shell. By symmetry o is the same at all
points of the shell; for equilibrium of the hemisphere we must have

This gives

o = y (6.8)

At any point of the shell the direct stress o has the same magnitude in all directions in the plane of
the surface of the shell; the state of stress is shown in Figure 6.6(ii). As p is small compared with
o, the maximum shearing stress occurs on planes at 45° to the tangent plane at any point.

Equation (6.8) is intended for determining membrane stresses in a perfect thin-walled spherical

6.3 Cylindrical shell with hemispherical ends
Some pressure vessels are fabricated with hemispherical ends; this has the advantage of reducing
the bending stresses in the cylinder when the ends are flat. Suppose the thicknesses ¢, and ¢, of the
cylindrical section and the hemispherical end, respectively (Figure 6.7), are proportioned so that

the radial expansion is the same for both cylinder and hemisphere; in this way we eliminate bending
stresses at the junction of the two parts.

For most metals v is approximately 0.3, so an average value of (t,/t,) is 1.7/0.7 = 2.4. The

6.4 Bending stresses in thin-walled circular cylinders

The theory presented in Section 6.1 is based on membrane theory and neglects bending stresses due
to end effects and ring stiffness. To demonstrate these effects, Figures 6.9 to 6.13 show plots of the
theoretical predictions for a ring stiffened circular cylinder’ together with experimental values,
shown by crosses. This ring stiffened cylinder, which was known as Model No. 2, was firmly fixed
at its ends, and subjected to an external pressure of 0.6895 MPa (100 psi), as shown by Figure 6.8.

7 Bending moments and shearing forces

7.1 Introduction

In Chapter 1 we discussed the stresses set up in a bar due to axial forces of tension and
compression. When a bar carries lateral forces, two important types of loading action are set up
at any section: these are a bending moment and a shearing force.

Consider first the simple case of a beam which is fixed rigidly at one end B and is quite free at
its remote end D, Figure 7.1; such a beam is called a cantilever, a familiar example of which is a
fishing rod held at one end. Imagine that the cantilever is horizontal, with one end B embedded
in a wall, and that a lateral force W is applied at the remote end D. Suppose the cantilever is
divided into two lengths by an imaginary section C; the lengths BC and CD must individually be
in a state of statical equilibrium. If we neglect the mass of the cantilever itself, the loading actions
over the section C of CD balance the actions of the force Wat C. The length CD of the cantilever
is in equilibrium if we apply an upwards vertical force F and an anti-clockwise couple M at C; F
is equal in magnitude to W, and M is equal to W(L -z), where z is measured from B. The force F
at Cis called a shearing force, and the couple M is a bending moment.

force in a simple cantilever beam. end load.

But at the imaginary section C of the cantilever, the actions F and M on CD are provided by
the length BC of the cantilever. In fact, equal and opposite actions F and M are applied by CD to
BC. For the length BC, the actions at C are a downwards shearing force F, and a clockwise couple
M.

170 Bending moments and shearing forces

When the cantilever carries external loads which are not applied normally to the axis of the
beam, Figure 7.2, axial forces are set up in the beam. If W is inclined at an angle 6 to the axis of
the beam, Figure 7.2, the axial thrust in the beam at any section is

P = Weoos 8 (7.1)

The bending moment and shearing force at a section a distance z from the built-in end are

M = W(L-z) sin 8 F = W sin 8 (7.2)

7.2 Concentrated and distributed loads

A concentrated load on a beam is one which can be regarded as acting wholly at one point of the
beam. For the purposes of calculation such a load is localised at a point of the beam; in reality this
would imply an infinitely large bearing pressure on the beam at the point of application of a
concentrated load. All loads must be distributed in practice over perhaps only a small length of
beam, thereby giving a finite bearing pressure. Concentrated loads arise frequently on a beam
where the beam is connected to other transverse beams.

In practice there are many examples of distributed loads: they arise when a wall is built on a
girder; they occur also in many problems of fluid pressure, such as wind pressure on a tall building,
and aerodynamic forces on an aircraft wing.

7.3 Relation between the intensity of loading, the shearing force,
and bending moment in a straight beam

Consider a straight beam under any system of lateral loads and external couples, Figure 7.3; an
element length 5z of the beam at a distance z from one end is acted upon by an external lateral load,
and internal bending moments and shearing forces. Suppose external lateral loads are distributed
so that the intensity of loading on the elemental length 6z is w.

al (er

Figure 7.3. Shearing and bending actions on an elemental length of a straight beam.

Relation between the intensity of loading, the shearing force, and bending moment 171

Then the external vertical force on the element is w6z, Figure 7.3; this is reacted by an internal
bending moment M and shearing force F on one face of the element, and M + 5M and F + 6F on
the other face of the element. For vertical equilibrium of the element we have

(F + 8F) - F + wéz = 0

If 5z is infinitesimally small,

dF

If F, and F, are the shearing forces atz = z, andz = z, respectively, then

Then, the decrease of shearing force from z, to z, is equal to the area below the load distribution
curve over this length of the beam, or the difference between F, and F, is the net lateral load over
this length of the beam.

Furthermore, for rotational equilibrium of the elemental length 6z,

IF OF oe = M+ BM + M+ we 2 al = 0

Then, to the first order of small quantities,

172 Bending moments and shearing forces

where M, and M, are the values Matz = z, andz = z,, respectively. Then the increase of
bending moment from z, to z, is the area below the shearing force curve for that length of the beam.

Equations (7.4) and (7.6) are extremely useful for finding the bending moments and shearing
forces in beams with irregularly distributed loads. From equation (7.4) the shearing force F at a
section distance z from one end of the beam is

F=F- [wee (7.7)

From equation (7.5) we have that the bending moment M has a stationary value when the shearing
force F is zero. Equations (7.3) and (7.5) give

@M = dadF _
neo «. (7.9)

For the directions of M, F and w considered in Figure 7.3, M is mathematically a maximum, since
d’M/dz’ is negative; the significance of the word mathematically will be made clearer in Section
7.8.

All the relations developed in this section are merely statements of statical equilibrium, and are
therefore true independently of the state of the material of the beam.

7.4 Sign conventions for bending moments and shearing forces

The bending moments on the elemental length 5z of Figure 7.3 tend to make the beam concave on
its upper surface and convex on its lower surface; such bending moments are sometimes called
sagging bending moments. The shearing forces on the elemental length tend to rotate the element
in a clockwise sense. In deriving the equations in this section it is assumed implicitly, therefore,
that

Cantilevers 173

(i) | downwards vertical loads are positive;
(ii) sagging bending moments are positive; and
(iii) clockwise shearing forces are positive.
These sign conventions are shown in Figure 7.4. Any other system of sign conventions can be

used, provided the signs of the loads, bending moments and shearing forces are considered when
equations (7.3) and (7.5) are applied to any particular problem.

Figures that show graphically the variations of bending moment and shearing force along the
length of a beam are called bending moment diagrams and shearing force diagrams. Sagging
bending moments are considered positive, and clockwise shearing forces taken as positive. The
two quantities are plotted above the centre line of the beam when positive, and below when
negative. Before we can calculate the stresses and deformations of beams, we must be able to find
the bending moment and shearing force at any section.

7.5 Cantilevers

A cantilever is a beam supported at one end only; for example, the beam already discussed in
Section 7.1, and shown in Figure 7.1, is held rigidly at B. Consider first the cantilever shown in
Figure 7.5(a), which carries a concentrated lateral load W at the free end. The bending moment
at a section a distance z from B is

M = -WL-z)

the negative sign occurring since the moment is hogging, as shown in Figure 7.5(b). The variation
of bending moment is linear, as shown in Figure 7.5(c). The shearing force at any section is

F = 4+W

is constant throughout the length of the cantilever. We note that

Figure 7.6 Bending-moment and shearing-force diagrams for a
cantilever under uniformly distributed load.

A cantilever 5S m long carries a uniformly distributed vertical load 480 N per
metre from C from H, and a concentrated vertical load of 1000 N at its mid-
length, D. Construct the shearing force and bending moment diagrams.


176 Bending moments and shearing forces

Solution

The shearing force due to the distributed load increases uniformly from zero at H to +1920 N at
C, and remains constant at +1920 N from C to B; this is shown by the lines (i). Due to the
concentrated load at D, the shearing force is zero from H to D, and equal to +1000 N from D to B,
as shown by lines (ii). Adding the two together we get the total shearing force shown by lines (iii).

B c D

The bending moment due to the distributed load increases parabolically from zero at H to
-5 (480) (4% = -3840 Nm

at C. The total load on CH is 1920 N with its centre of gravity 3 m from B; thus the bending
moment at B due to this load is

-(1920)(3) = -5760 Nm
From C to B the bending moment increases uniformly, giving lines (i). The bending moment due
to the concentrated load increases uniformly from zero at D to

-(1000)(2.5) = -2500 Nm

at B, as shown by lines (ii). Combining (i) and (ii), the total bending moment is given by (iii).

The method used here for determining shearing-force and bending-moment diagrams is known as
the principle of superposition.

7.6 Cantilever with non-uniformly distributed load

Where a cantilever carries a distributed lateral load of variable intensity, we can find the bending
moments and shearing forces from equations (7.4) and (7.6). When the loading intensity w cannot
be expressed as a simple analytic function of z, equations (7.4) and (7.6) can be integrated
numerically.

Problem 7.2 A cantilever of length 10 m, built in at its left end, carries a distributed lateral
load of varying intensity w N per metre length. Construct curves of shearing
force and bending moment in the cantilever.

Solution

If z is the distance from the free end of cantilever, the shearing force at a distance z from the free
end is
Fe [was

We find first the shearing force F by numerical integration of the w-curve. The greatest force
occurs at the built-in end, and has the value

Fu, + 3400N

The bending moment at a section a distance z from the free end is

Me=- [ras

178 Bending moments and shearing forces

and is found therefore by numerical integration of the F-curve. The greatest bending moment
occurs at the built-in end, and has the value

Mix = 22500 Nm
NB It should be noted that by inspection the bending moment and the shearing force at the

free end of the cantilever are zero; these are boundary conditions.

7.7 Simply-supported beams

By simply-supported we mean that the supports are of such a nature that they do not apply any
resistance to bending of a beam; for instance, knife-edges or frictionless pins perpendicular to the
plane of bending cannot transmit couples to a beam. The remarks concerning bending moments
and shearing forces, which were made in Section 7.5 in relation to cantilevers, apply equally to
beams simply-supported at each end, or with any conditions of end support.

As an example, consider the beam shown in Figure 7.7(a), which is simply-supported at B and
C, and carries a vertical load Wa distance a from B. If the ends are simply-supported no bending
moments are applied to the beam at B and C. By taking moments about B and C we find that the
reactions at these supports are

*(L- a) and 2%

respectively. Now consider a section of the beam a distance z from B; ifz< a, the bending moment
and shearing force are

60 R, = (200 x 10°) (45) + (50 x 10°) (30) + (300 x 10°) (15) = 15 000 x 10°
Then
R, = 250 kN
and
R, = (200 10°) + (50 x 10°) + (300 x 10°) - R, = 300 kN

The bending moment varies linearly between B and C, and between C and D, and parabolically
from D to F. The maximum bending moment is 4.5 MNm, and occurs at D. The maximum
shearing force is 300 KN, and occurs at F.

These give the shearing forces at the end of the beam, and the shearing force at any point of the

actions on the beam as the superposition of a uniformly distributed load and end couples; the
distributed load gives rise to a parabolic bending moment curve, BDC in Figure 7.9(iii), whereas
the end couples M, and M, give the straight line HJ, Figure 7.9(iv). The combined effects of the
lateral load and the end couples give the curve BHD‘JC, Figure 7.9(v). The bending moment at

Furthermore, from equation (7.6), the bending moment a distance z from B is

M = M+ Fy - f f wdz dz (7.23)

where M, is the bending moment at z = 0. However, as the beam is simply-supported at z = 0,
we have M, = 0, and so

M = Fy - [" [* wazdz
eh
The end z = L is also simply-supported, so for this end M = 0; then

Fol - [ [° waede = 0

This gives

Fy = -f [ji weds (7.24)

Equations (7.22), (7.23) and (7.24) may be used in the graphical solution of problems in which
wis not an analytic function of z. The value of F;, is found firstly from equation (7.24); numerical
integrations then give the values of F and M, from equations (7.22) and (7.23), respectively.

7.12 Plane curved beams

Consider a beam BCD, Figure 7.14, which is curved in the plane of the figure. The beam is loaded
so that no twisting occurs, and bending is confined to the plane of Figure 7.14. Suppose an
imaginary cross-section of the beam is taken at C; statical equilibrium of the length CD of the
beam is ensured if, in general, a force and a couple act at C; it is convenient to consider the
resultant force at Cas consisting of two components—an axial force P, acting along the centre line
of the beam, and a lateral force F, acting along the normal to the centre line of the beam. The
couple M at C acts about an axis perpendicular to the plane of bending and passing through the
centre line of the beam. The actions at C on the length BC of the beam, are equal and opposite to
those at C on the length CD.

As before the couple M is the bending moment in the beam at C, and the lateral force F is the
shearing force.

190 Bending moments and shearing forces

As an example, consider the beam of Figure 7.15, which has a centre line of constant radius R.
The beam carries a radial load W at its free end. Consider a section of the beam at some angular

Consider again, the beam shown in Figure 7.16, consisting of two straight limbs, BC and CD,
connected at C. In CD the bending moment varies linearly, from zero at D to 70 000 Nm at C.
In BC the bending moment is constant and equal to 70 000 Nm. In Figure 7.17 the bending
moments are plotted on the concave sides of the bent limbs; this is equivalent to following the sign

Problem 7.6 _—_—AB is a vertical post of a crane; the sockets at A and B offer no constraint

the strut FE which is freely hinged at its two extremities to AB and CD.
Construct the bending moment diagrams for AB and CD. (Cambridge)

B.M. diagram for AB

Solution

It is clear from considering the equilibrium of the whole crane that the horizontal reactions at A
and B must be equal and opposite, and that the couple due to them must equal the moment of the
20 KN force. Let R be the magnitude of the horizontal reactions at A and B, then

7R = 7(20000)

and therefore

R = 20000 N

Let P = the pullin CE, and Q = the thrust in FE. Then taking moments about C for the rod CD
we have

40 sin@ = 7(20000)

and therefore

Q = 58300 N
Resolving horizontally for AB we have

P = Qcosd = > (70000) cote = 46700 N

The vertical reaction atE = QsinO = 35 000N.

We can now draw the bending moment diagrams for AB and CD, considering only the forces
at right-angles to each beam; let us take CD first. CD is a beam freely supported at C and £ and
loaded at D. The bending moment at EF = 3 x 20000 = 60000 Nn, to which value it rises
uniformly from zero at D; from E to C the bending moment decreases uniformly to zero.

192 Bending moments and shearing forces
AB is supported at A and B and loaded with equal and opposite loads at C and F.
The bending moment at C is
(2) (20000) = 40000 Nm.
The bending moment at F is
(2) (-20 000) = -40 000 Nm.
At any point z between C and F, the bending moment is

M = 20000 (z+ 2) - 46 700z = 40000 - 26 700z

In the bending moment diagram positive bending moments are those which make the beam

concave to the left, and are plotted to the left in the figure.

7.13 More general case of bending of a curved bar

In Figure 7.17, OBC represents the centre line of a beam of any shape; the line OBC is curved in
space in general. Suppose the beam carries any system of external loads; consider the actions over
a section of the beam at B. For statical equilibrium of BC we require at B a force and a couple.

The force is resolved into two components—an axial force P along the centre line of the beam,
and a shearing force F normal to the centre line; the couple is resolved into two components—a
torque 7 about the centre line of the beam, and a bending moment M about an axis perpendicular

to the centre line. The axis of M is not necessarily coincident with the axis of F.

the actions at C on DC and consider these reversed actions at C on BC. Equilibrium of BC is
ensured if there is a shearing force of 10 kN at B, a bending moment of 70 kNm, and a torque of
50 kNm.

7.14 Rolling loads and influence lines

In the design of bridge girders it is frequently necessary to know the maximum bending moment
and shearing force which each section will have to bear when a travelling load, such as a train,
passes from one end of the bridge to the other. The diagrams which we have considered so far
show the simultaneous values of the bending moment, or shearing force, for all sections of the
beam with the loads in one fixed position; we shall now see how to construct a diagram which
shows the greatest value of these quantities for all positions of the loads. These diagrams are
called maximum bending moment or maximum shearing force, diagrams.

We assume that the loads on a beam are moving slowly; then there are negligible inertia effects
from the mass of the beam and any moving masses.

7.15 A single concentrated load traversing a beam

Suppose a single concentrated vertical load W travels slowly along a beam BC, which is simply-
supported at each end, Figure 7.18(i). Ifa is the distance of the load from B, the reactions at B and
C are

R, = (L-a) Ro = —

mls

The bending moment at a distance z from B, is

M = Ft - a) for z <a (7.26)
M = au.) forz>a (7.27)

Consider the load rolling slowly from C to B: initially z < a, and the bending moment, given by
equation 7.26, increases as a decreases; whena = z,

M = “2 -:) (7.28)

As W proceeds further, we have z > a, and the bending moment, given by equation (7.27),
decreases as a decreases further.

Clearly, equation 7.28 is the greatest bending moment which can occur at the section; thus, for any
section a distance z from B, the maximum bending moment that can be induced is

Mn = = (L - 2) (7.29)

and this occurs when the load W is at that section of the beam. The variation of M,,,, for different
values of z is shown in Figure 7.18(ii); the curve of M,,,, is a parabola, attaining a peak value when
z = ‘AL, for which

The shearing force a distance z from B is

Fo= Rp = IL-9) for z<a (7.30)
Fo = -Re = = for z>a (7.31)

Consider again a load rolling slowly from C to B; initially z < a, and the shearing force, given by
equation (7.30), is positive and increases as a diminishes. The greatest positive shearing force

196 Bending moments and shearing forces

occurs just before the load W passes the section under consideration; it has the value

Fig(t) = = (L - z) (7.32)

After the load has passed the section being considered, that is, when z > a, the shearing force,
given by equation (7.31) is negative and decreases as a diminishes further. The greatest negative
shearing force occurs when the load W has just passed the section at a distance z; it has the value

The variations of maximum positive and negative shearing forces are shown in Figure 7.18(iii).

7.16 Influence lines of bending moment and shearing force

A curve that shows the value of the bending moment at a given section of a beam, for all positions
ofa travelling load, is called the bending-moment influence line for that section; similarly, a curve
that shows the shearing force at the section for all positions of the load is called the shearing force
influence line for the section. The distinction between influence lines and maximum bending-
moment (or shearing force) diagrams must be carefully noted: for a given load there will be only
one maximum bending-moment diagram for the beam, but an infinite number of bending-moment
influence lines, one for each section of the beam.

Figure 7.19 (i) Single rolling load on a simply-supported beam. (ii) Bending-moment
influence line for section C. (iit) Shearing force influence line for Section C.

Influence lines of bending moment and shearing force 197

Consider a simply-supported beam, Figure 7.19, carrying a single concentrated load, W. As the
load rolls across the beam, the bending moments at a section C of the beam vary with the position
of the load. Suppose W is a distance z from B; then the bending moment at a section C is given
by

M = ~=(L-a) for z<a

and Me= 7a |

L-2z) for z >a

The first of these equations gives the straight line BH in Figure 7.19(ii), and the second the line
HD. The influence line for bending moments at C is then BHD; the bending moment is greatest
when the load acts at the section.

Again, the shearing force at C is

W:
F=-— for z<a
L

and Fe= + (4-2) for z>a

These relationships give the lines BFCGD for the shearing force influence line for C. There is an
abrupt change of shearing force as the load W crosses the section C.

8 Geometrical properties of cross-sections

8.1 Introduction

The strength of a component of a structure is dependent on the geometrical properties of its cross-
section in addition to its material and other properties. For example, a beam with a large cross-
section will, in general, be able to resist a bending moment more readily than a beam with a smaller
cross-section. Typical cross-section of structural members are shown in Figure 8.1.

FOL TL

(a) Rectangle (b) Circle (c) ‘Il’ beam (d) ‘Tee’ beam (e) Angie bar

Figure 8.1 Some typical cross-sections of structural components.

The cross-section of Figure 8.1(c) is also called a rolled steel joist (RSJ); it is used extensively
in structural engineering. It is quite common to make cross-sections of metai structural members
in the form of the cross-sections of Figure 8.1(c) to (e), as such cross-sections are structurally more
efficient in bending than cross-sections such as Figures 8.1(a) and (b). Wooden beams are usually
of rectangular cross-section and not of the forms shown in Figures 8.1(c) to (e). This is because
wooden beams have grain and will have lines of weakness along their grain if constructed as in
Figures 8.1(c) to (e).

8.2 Centroid

The position of the centroid of a cross-section is the centre of the moment of area of the cross-
section. If the cross-section is constructed from a homogeneous material, its centroid will lie at the
same position as its centre of gravity.

Centroidal axes 201

Figure 8.2 Cross-section.

Let G denote the position of the centroid of the plane lamina of Figure 8.2. At the centroid the
moment of area is zero, so that the following equations apply

xx dA =Zy ddA = 0 (8.1)
where dA = elemental area of the lamina
x = horizontal distance of dA from G

y = vertical distance of dA from G
8.3 Centroidal axes
These are the axes that pass through the centroid.
8.4 Second moment of area (I)

The second moments of area of the lamina about the x - x and y - y axes, respectively, are given
by

I = Ly’ dA = second moment of area about x - x (8.2)
I,, = 1.x’ dA = second moment of area about y - y (8.3)

Now from Pythagoras’ theorem

Equation (8.4) is known as the perpendicular axes theorem which states that the sum of the second

moments of area of two mutually perpendicular axes of a lamina is equal to the polar second
moment of area about a point where these two axes cross.

8.5 Parallel axes theorem
Consider the lamina of Figure 8.4, where the x—x axis passes through its centroid. Suppose that

I,, is known and that I,, is required, where the X~X axis lies parallel to the x—x axis and at a
perpendicular distance h from it.

but
I, = Xy dA
oly = 1, +h’? Idd

where
A = areaoflamina = 2 dA

Equation (8.9) is known as the parallel axes theorem, which states that the second moment of area
about the X—X axis is equal to the second moment of area about the x—x axis + h’ x A, where x—x
and X—X are parallel.

h = the perpendicular distance between the xx and A—X axes.
I, = the second moment of area about x-x
Igy = the second moment of area about X—X

The importance of the parallel axes theorem is that it is useful for calculating second moments of
area of sections of RSJs, tees, angle bars etc. The geometrical properties of several cross-sections
will now be determined.

Problem 8.1 Determine the second moment of area of the rectangular section about its
centroid (x—x) axis and its base (X—X ) axis; see Figure 8.5. Hence or
otherwise, verify the parallel axes theorem.

9 Longitudinal stresses in beams

9.1 Introduction

We have seen that when a straight beam carries lateral loads the actions over any cross-section of
the beam comprise a bending moment and shearing force; we have also seen how to estimate the
magnitudes of these actions. The next step in discussing the strength of beams is to consider the
stresses caused by these actions.

Asa simple instance consider a cantilever carrying a concentrated load W at its free end, Figure
9.1. At sections of the beam remote from the free end the upper longitudinal fibres of the beam
are stretched, i.e. tensile stresses are induced; the lower fibres are compressed. There is thus a
variation of direct stress throughout the depth of any section of the beam. In any cross-section of
the beam, as in Figure 9.2, the upper fibres which are stretched longitudinally contract laterally
owing to the Poisson ratio effect, while the lower fibres extend laterally; thus the whole cross-
section of the beam is distorted.

In addition to longitudinal direct stresses in the beam, there are also shearing stresses over any
cross-section of the beam. In most engineering problems shearing distortions in beams are
relatively unimportant; this is not true, however, of shearing stresses.

9.2. Pure bending of a rectangular beam

An elementary bending problem is that of a rectangular beam under end couples. Consider a
straight uniform beam having a rectangular cross-section of breadth b and depth A, Figure 9.3; the
axes of symmetry of the cross-section are Cx, Cy.

A long length of the beam is bent in the yz-plane, Figure 9.4, in such a way that the longitudinal
centroidal axis, Cz, remains unstretched and takes up a curve of uniform radius of curvature, R.

We consider an elemental length 5z of the beam, remote from the ends; in the unloaded
condition, AB and FD are transverse sections at the ends of the elemental length, and these sections
are initially parallel. In the bent form we assume that planes such as AB and FD remain flat

Pure bending of a rectangular beam 213

planes; A ’B ‘and F ’D ‘in Figure 9.4 are therefore cross-sections of the bent beam, but are no
longer parallel to each other.

Figure 9.3 Cross-section of a Figure 9.4 Beam bent to a uniform radius of
rectangular beam. curvature R in the yz-plane.

In the bent form, some of the longitudinal fibres, such as A “F ¢ are stretched, whereas others,
such as B ‘D ’ are compressed. The unstrained middle surface of the beam is known as the neutral
axis. Now consider an elemental fibre H// of the beam, parallel to the longitudinal axis Cz, Figure
9.5; this fibre is at a distance y from the neutral surface and on the tension side of the beam. The
original length of the fibre H// in the unstrained beam is 5z; the strained length is

H's' = + oz
J (R + y) R

because the angle between A ’B ‘and F ’D “in Figure 9.4 and 9.5 is (6z/R). Then during bending
HJ stretches an amount

Hl! - HI = (R+y)%-o& = L&
R R

The longitudinal strain of the fibre H/ is therefore

e = |X sz|/o& = &
R R

214 Longitudinal stresses in beams

Figure 9.5 Stresses on a bent element of the beam.

Then the longitudinal strain at any fibre is proportional to the distance of that fibre from the neutral
surface; over the compressed fibres, on the lower side of the beam, the strains are of course
negative.

If the material of the beam remains elastic during bending then the longitudinal stress on the
fibre HJ is

o = Ee = — (9.1)

The distribution of longitudinal stresses over the cross-section takes the form shown in Figure 9.6;
because of the symmetrical distribution of these stresses about Cx, there is no resultant longitudinal
thrust on the cross-section of the beam. The resultant hogging moment is

sth

M = fy oby dy (9.2)

On substituting for o from equation (9.1), we have

(9.3)

longitudinal force and a resultant couple M.

where J, is the second moment of area of the cross-section about Cx. From equations (9.1) and
(9.3), we have

(9.4)

1R

We deduce that a uniform radius of curvature, R, of the centroidal axis Cz can be sustained by end
couples M, applied about the axes Cx at the ends of the beam.

Equation (9.3) implies a linear relationship between M, the applied moment, and (1/R), the
curvature of the beam. The constant £/, in this linear relationship is called the bending stiffness
or sometimes the flexural stiffness of the beam; this stiffness is the product of Young’s modulus,
£, and the second moment of area, /,, of the cross-section about the axis of bending.

Problem 9.1 A steel bar of rectangular cross-section, 10 cm deep and 5 cm wide, is bent in
the planes of the longer sides. Estimate the greatest allowable bending moment
if the bending stresses are not to exceed 150 MN/m’ in tension and
compression.

The bending moment is applied about Cx. The second moment of area about this axis is

which is only half that about Cx.
9.3 Bending of a beam about a principal axis

Insection 9.2 we considered the bending of a straight beam of rectangular cross-section; this form
of cross-section has two axes of symmetry. More generally we are concerned with sections having

only one, or no, axis of symmetry.

Consider a long straight uniform beam having any cross-sectional form, Figure 9.7; the axes
Cx and Cy are principal axes of the cross-section. The principal axes of a cross-section are those
centroid axes for which the product second moments of area are zero. In Figure 9.7, C is the
centroidal of the cross-section; Cz is the longitudinal centroidal axis.

When end couples M are applied to the beam, we assume as before that transverse sections of the
beam remain plane during bending. Suppose further that, if the beam is bent in the yz-plane only,
there is a neutral axis C ’x { Figure 9.7, which is parallel to Cx and is unstrained; radius of
curvature of this neutral surface is R, Figure 9.8. As before, the strain in a longitudinal fibre at a
distance y “from C “x ‘is

9.4 Beams having two axes of symmetry in the cross-section

Many cross-sectional forms used in practice have two axes of symmetry; examples are the
I-section and circular sections, Figure 9.9, besides the rectangular beam already discussed.

9.5 Beams having only one axis of symmetry

Other common sections in use, as shown in Figure 9.10, have only one axis of symmetry Cx. In
each of these, Cx is the axis of symmetry, and Cx and Cy are both principal axes. When bending
moments M, and M, are applied about Cx and Cy, respectively, the bending stresses are again
given by equations (9.7) and (9.8). However, an important feature of beams of this type is that
their behaviour in bending when shearing forces are also present is not as simple as that of beams
having two axes of symmetry. This problem is discussed in Chapter 10.

Problem 9.4 A T-section of uniform thickness 1 cm has a flange breadth of 10 cm and an
overall depth of 10 cm. Estimate the allowable bending moments about the
principal axes if the bending stresses are limited to 150 MN/m’.

Solution

Suppose y is the distance of the principal axis Cx from the remote edge of the flange. The total
area of the section is

A = (0.10) (0.01) + (0.09) (0.01) = 1.90 x 103 m?

On taking first moments of areas about the upper edge of the flange,

Ay = (0.10)(0.01)(0.005) + (0.09)(0.01)(0.055) = 0.0545  10?m?

The second moment of area of the flange about Cx is

The second moment of area of the web about Cx is

= (0.01) (0.09. + (0.09) (0.01) (0.0263)2. = 1.230 x 10° m4

Then
I, = (0.570 + 1.230) 10° = 1.800 x 10° m4

For bending about Cx, the greatest bending stress occurs at the toe of the web, as shown in the
figure. The maximum allowable moment is

M (150 x 10%) (1.800 x 10°)

f= 3790 Nm
0.0713

The bending stress in the extreme fibres of the flange is only 60.4 MN/m’ at this bending moment.
The second moment of area about Cy is

9.6 More general case of pure bending

section. Consider a long uniform beam, Figure 9.11, having any cross-section; the centroid of a

perpendicular axes in the cross-section. The axes Cx, Cy and Cz are therefore centroidal axes of
the beam.

Figure 9.11 Co-ordinate system for a beam of any cross-sectional form.

We suppose first that the beam is bent in the yz-plane only, in such a way that the axis Cz takes
up the form of a circular arc of radius R,, Figure 9.12. Suppose further there is no longitudinal
strain of Cx; this axis is then a neutral axis. The strain at a distance y from the neutral axis is

find the equation of the neutral axis of the beam.

Neutral axis A

More general case of pure bending 227

Solution

From Problem 9.2

I= 1.641 = 10%m*, 7, = 0.130 x 10° m*

For bending about Cx the bending stresses in the extreme fibres of the flanges are

M,y _ (2500) (0.05)
I, 1.641 x 10°

Go = 76.1 MN/m2

For bending about Cy the bending stresses at the extreme ends of the flanges are

M,x _ (500) (0.025)
I, 0.130 x 10°

96.1 MN/m?

On superposing the stresses due to the separate moments, the stress at the corner a is tensile, and
of magnitude

6, = (76.1 + 96.1) = 172.2 MN/m?

The total stress at the comer a “is also 172.2 MN/m’, but compressive. The total stress at the
comer 5 is compressive, and of magnitude

6, = (96.1 - 76.1) = 20.2 MN/m?

The total stress at the corner b ‘is also 20.0 MN/m’, but tensile. The equation of the neutral axis
is given by

xM, I. + yM, I = 0

Then

The greatest bending stresses occur at points most remote from the neutral axis; these are the
points a and a“ the greatest bending stresses are therefore +172.2 MN/m’.

9.7 Elastic section modulus

For bending of a section about a principal axis Cx, the longitudinal bending stress at a fibre a
distance y from Cx, due to a moment M,, is from equation (9.18) (in which we put /,, = 0 and M,
= 0),

where J, is the second moment of area about Cx. The greatest bending stress occurs at the fibre
most remote from Cx. If the distance to the extreme fibre is y,,,,, the maximum bending stress is

The geometrical quantity (//y,,,,) is the elastic section modulus, and is denoted by Z,.

Then

The allowable bending moment is therefore the product of a geometrical quantity, Z,, and the
maximus allowable stress, o,,,,. The quantity Z, o,,,, 18 frequently called the elastic moment of
resistance.

Problem 9.6 A steel I-beam is to be designed to carry a bending moment of 10° Nm, and the

The elastic section modulus of a 22.8 cm by 17.8 cm standard steel I-beam about its axis of
greatest bending stiffness is 0.759 x 10°* m’, which is a suitable beam.

9.8 Longitudinal stresses while shearing forces are present

The analysis of the proceeding paragraphs deals with longitudinal stresses in beams under uniform
bending moment. No shearing forces are present at cross-sections of the beam in this case.

When a beam carries lateral forces, bending moments may vary along the length of the beam.
Under these conditions we may assume with sufficient accuracy in most engineering problems that
the longitudinal stresses at any section are dependant only on the bending moment at that section,
and are unaffected by the shearing force at that section.

Where a shearing force is present at the section of a beam, an elemental length of the beam
undergoes a slight shearing distortion; these shearing distortions make a negligible contribution
to the total deflection of the beam in most engineering problems.

What maximum central lateral load may be applied if the bending stresses are

9.9 Calculation of the principal second moments of area

In problems of bending involving beams of unsymmetrical cross-section we have frequently to
find the principal axes of the cross-section.
Suppose Cx and Cy are any two centroidal axes of the cross-section of the beam, Figure 9.15.

Calculation of the principal second moments of area 231

Figure 9.15 Derivation of the principal axes of a section.

If 5A is an elemental area of the cross-section at the point (x, y), then the property of the axes Cx
and Cy is that

[4 = [4 = 0

The second moments of area about the axes Cx and Cy, respectively, are

[= f y*dd, I, = f x7dA (9.22)

The product second moment of area is

Ty = I, xydA (9.23)

Now consider two mutually perpendicular axes Cx “and Cy { which are the principal axes of
bending, inclined at an angle 6 to the axes Cx and Cy. A point having co-ordinates (x, y) in the xy-
system, now has co-ordinates (x 7 y } in the x “y ‘system. Further, we have

x’ = x cos® + y sin@

y’ = ycos® - x sin®

The second moment of area of the cross-section about Cx “is

ar = f, y'1?dA

which becomes

232 Longitudinal stresses in beams

This may be written

Ir = cos’@ f, y’dd - 2 cos® sin@ f xydA + sin’6 f x?dA
A

But
[vu = I fx? dA = I, and [7744 = I,

Then
I, = I, cos’@ - 21, cos® sind + 7, sin?0 (9.24)
Similarly, the second moment of area about Cy “is

| [x?a4 = [& cos8 + y sin) d4
3 A A

Then
I, = I, cos’® + 2/,, cos® sin@ + J, sin’ (9.25)

Finally, the product second moment of area about Cx ‘and Cy “is

Tyr = fi x'y'dA I, (x cos® + y sin®) (vy cos® - x sin@)dd

Then
My! = /, sin® cos + /,, (cos? 0 — sin? ) - i, cos® sin® (9.26)

We note from equations (9.24) and (9.25), that
Lith = +h (9.27)

that is, the sum of the second moments of area about any perpendicular axes is independent of 8.
The sum is in fact the polar second moment of area, or the second moment of area about an axis
through C, perpendicular to the xy-plane.

We may write equation (9.26) in the form

9.11. Change of cross-section in pure bending

In Section 9.1 we pointed out the change which takes place in the shape of the cross-section when
a beam is bent. This change involves infinitesimal lateral strains in the beam. The upper and
lower edges of a cross-section which was originally rectangular, are strained into concentric
circular arcs with their centre on the opposite side of the beam to the axis of bending. The upper
and lower surfaces of the beam then have anticlastic curvature, the general nature of the strain
being as shown in Figure 9.18. The anticlastic curvature effect can be readily observed by bending
a flat piece of india-rubber. If the beam is bent to a mean radius R, we find that cross-sections are

bent to a mean radius (R/).

10 Shearing stresses in beams

10.1. Introduction

We referred earlier to the existence of longitudinal direct stresses in a cantilever with a lateral load
at the free end; on a closer study we found that these stresses are distributed linearly over the cross-
section of a beam carrying a uniform bending moment. In general we are dealing with bending
problems in which there are shearing forces present at any cross-section, as well as bending
moments. In practice we find that the longitudinal direct stresses in the beam are almost unaffected
by the shearing force at any section, and are governed largely by the magnitude of the bending
moment at that section. Consider again the bending of a cantilever with a concentrated lateral load
F, at the free end, Figure 10.1; Suppose the beam is of rectangular cross-section. If we cut the
beam at any transverse cross-section, we must apply bending moments M and shearing forces F
at the section to maintain equilibrium. The bending moment M is distributed over the cross-section
in the form of longitudinal direct stresses, as already discussed.

Figure 10.1 Shearing actions in a cantilever carrying an end load.

The shearing force F is distributed in the form of shearing stresses 1, acting tangentially to the
cross-section of the beam; the form of the distribution of t is dependent on the shape of the cross-
section of the beam, and on the direction of application of the shearing force F. An interesting
feature of these shearing stresses is that, as they give rise to complementary shearing stresses, we
find that shearing stresses are also set up in longitudinal planes parallel to the axis of the beam.

10.2 Shearing stresses in a beam of narrow rectangular
cross-section

We consider first the simple problem of a cantilever of narrow rectangular cross-section, carrying
a concentrated lateral load F at the free end, Figure 10.2; A is the depth of the cross-section, and
tis the thickness, Figure 10.3; the depth is assumed to be large compared with the thickness. The
load is applied in a direction parallel to the longer side h.

By a similar argument we have that the total force on the face DH due to bending stresses o + 56

These longitudinal force, which act in opposite directions, are not quite in balance; they differ by
a small amount

Now the upper surface BD is completely free of shearing stress, and this out-of-balance force can
only be equilibrated by a shearing force on the face GH. We suppose this shearing force is
distributed uniformly over the face GH; the shearing stress on this face is then

This shearing stress acts on a plane parallel to the neutral surface of the beam; it gives rise therefore
to a complementary shearing stress t at a point of the cross-section a distance y, from the neutral
axis, and acting tangentially to the cross-section. Our analysis gives then the variation of shearing
stress over the depth of the cross-section. For this simple type of cross-section

The shearing stresses must necessarily be zero at the extreme fibres as there can be no
complementary shearing stresses in the longitudinal direction on the upper and lower surfaces of
the beam.

In the case of a cantilever with a single concentrated load F at the free end the shearing force
is the same for all cross-sections, and the distribution of shearing stresses is also the same for all
cross-sections. In a more general case the shearing force is variable from one cross-section to
another: in this case the value of F to be used is the shearing force at the section being considered.

10.3. Beam of any cross-section having one axis of symmetry
We are concerned generally with more complex cross-sectional forms than narrow rectangles.

Consider a beam having a uniform cross-section which is symmetrical about Cy, Figure 10.5.
Suppose, as before, that the beam is a cantilever carrying an end load F acting parallel to Cy and

Beam of any cross-section having one axis of symmetry 249

passing through the centroid C of the cross-section. Then Cx is the axis of bending.
Consider an elemental Jength 5z of the beam; on the near face of this element, which is at a
distance z from the free end of the cantilever, the bending moment is

M = Fz

This gives rise to bending stresses in the cross-section; the longitudinal bending stress at a point
of the cross-section a distance y from the neutral axis Cx is

oO = MW = yz
I, I,

(ii)

Figure 10.5 Shearing stresses in a bent beam having one axis of symmetry.

Now consider a section of the element cut off by the cylindrical surface BDEGH/J, Figure 10.5(iii),
which is parallel to Cz. Suppose A is the area of each end of this cylindrical element; then the total
longitudinal force on the end BDE due to bending stresses is

[ou = 7 I,

where 6A is an element of the area A, and y is the distance of this element from the neutral axis Cx.
The total longitudinal force on the remote end GH/J due to bending stresses is

When b is small compared with the other linear dimensions of the cross-section we find that the
shearing stress is nearly uniformly distributed over the surfaces of the type BDEGHJ. This is the
case in thin-walled beams, such as I-sections and channel sections.

10.4 Shearing stresses in an l-beam

As an application of the general method developed in the preceding paragraph, consider the
shearing stresses induced in a thin-walled I-beam carrying a concentrated load F at the free end,
acting parallel to Cy, Figure 10.6. The cross-section has two axes of symmetry Cx and Cy; the
flanges are of breadth b, and the distance between the centres of the flanges is A; the flanges and
web are assumed to be of uniform thickness f.

Equation (10.4) gives the shearing force q per unit length of beam at any region of the cross-
section. Consider firstly a point / of the flange at a distance s, from a free edge, Figure 10.6(iii);
the area of flange cut off by a section through the point / is

A = Sit

The distance of the centroid of this area from the neutral axis Cx is

As the cross-section is symmetrical about Cy, the shearing stress in the adjacent flange also
increases linearly from zero at the free edge.

of the flanges and web. In evaluating Ay for this section we must consider the total area cut off by

Shearing stresses in an I-beam 253

We notice that t varies parabolically throughout the depth of the web, attaining a maximum
value ats, = ‘4h, the neutral axis, Figure 10.7. In any cross-section of the beam the shearing
stresses vary in the form shown; in the flanges the stresses are parallel to Cx, and contribute
nothing to the total force on the section parallel to Cy.

At the junctions of the web and flanges the shearing stress in the web is twice the shearing
stresses in the flanges. The reason for this is easily seen by considering the equilibrium conditions
at this junction. Consider a unit length of the beam along the line of the junction, Figure 10.8; the
shearing stresses in the flanges are

For longitudinal equilibrium of a unit length of the junction of web and flanges, we have

which gives

Tt = 2t, (10.14)

Figure 10.8 Equilibrium of shearing forces at the junction
of the web and flanges of an I-beam.

This is true, in fact, for the relations we have derived above; longitudinal equilibrium is ensured
at any section of the cross-section in our treatment of the problem. If the flanges and web were of
different thicknesses, f,and t,, respectively, the equilibrium condition at the junction would be

ww

21, ty = Tt

254 Shearing stresses in beams

Then

= f (10.15)

The implication of this equilibrium condition is that at a junction, such as that of the flanges and
web of an I-section, the sum of the shearing forces per unit length for the components meeting at
that junction is zero when account is taken of the relevant directions of these shearing forces. For
a junction

yw = 0 (10.16)

where t is the shearing stress in an element at the junction, and t is the thickness of the element;
the summation is carried out for all elements meeting at the junction.

For an I-section carrying a shearing force acting parallel to the web we see that the maximum
shearing stress occurs at the middle of the web, and is given by equation (10.11). Now, /, for the

10.5 Principal stresses in beams

We have shown how to find separately the longitudinal stress at any point in a beam due to bending
moment, and the mean horizontal and vertical shearing stresses, but it does not follow that these
are the greatest direct or shearing stresses. Within the limits of our present theory we can employ
the formulae of Sections 5.7 and 5.8 to find the principal stresses and the maximum shearing stress.

We can draw, on a side elevation of the beam, lines showing the direction of the principal
stresses. Such lines are called the lines of principal stress; they are such that the tangent at any
point gives the direction of principal stress. As an example, the lines of principal stress have been
drawn in Figure 10.9 for a simply-supported beam of uniform rectangular cross-section, carrying
a uniformly distributed load. The stresses are a maximum where the tangents to the curves are
parallel to the axis of the beam, and diminish to zero when the curves cut the faces of the beam at
right angles. On the neutral axis, where the stress is one of shear, the principal stress curves cut
the axis at 45°.

Figure 10.9 Principal stress lines in a simply-supported rectangular beam
carrying a uniformly distributed load.

Problem 10.2 The flanges of an I-girder are 30 cm wide by 2.5 cm thick and the web is 60 cm
deep by 1.25 cm thick. Ata particular section the sagging bending moment is
500 kNm and the shearing force is 500 KN. Consider a point in the section at
the top of the web and calculate for this point; (i) the longitudinal stress, (ii) the
shearing stress, (iii) the principal stresses. (Cambridge)

Solution

First calculate the second moment of area about the neutral axis; the second moment of area of the
web is

= (0.0125) (0.62 = 0.225 x 103 m*

The second moment of area of each flange is

(0.3) (0.025) (0.3125)? = 0.733 x 103 m4

Principal stresses in beams 257

The total second moment of area is then

I, = [0.225 + 2(0.733)110% = 1.691 x 10° m‘

Next, for a point at the top of the web,

Ay = (0.3 x 0.025) (0.3125) = 2.34 x 103 m4
Then, for this point, with M@ = 500 kNm we have

It should be noticed that the greater principal stress is about 30% greater than the longitudinal
stress. At the top of the flange the longitudinal stress is -96 MN/m’, so the greatest principal stress
at the top of the web is 20% greater than the maximum longitudinal stress.

258 Shearing stresses in beams

10.6 Superimposed beams

If we make a beam by placing one member on the top of another, Figure 10.10, there will be a
tendency, under the action of lateral loads for the two members to slide over each other along the
plane of contact AB, Figure 10.10. Unless this sliding action is prevented in some way, the one
beam will act independently of the other; when there is no shearing connection between the beams
along AB, the strength of the compound beam is the sum of the strengths of the separate beams.

However, if the sliding action is resisted, the compound beam behaves more nearly as a solid
member; for elastic bending the permissible moment is proportional to the elastic section modulus.

Figure 10.10 Sliding action between two beams superimposed
without shearing connections.

In the case of two equal beams of rectangular cross-section, the elastic section modulus of each
beam is

where 5b is the breadth and / is the depth of each beam. For two such beams, placed one on the
other, without shearing connection, the elastic section modulus is

The elastic section modulus, and therefore the permissible bending moment, is doubled by
providing a shearing connection between the two beams. In the case of steel beams, the flanges
along the plane of contact AB, may be riveted, bolted, or welded together.

Shearing stresses in a channel section; shear centre 259

10.7 Shearing stresses in a channel section; shear centre

We have discussed the general case of shearing stresses in the bending of a beam having an axis
of symmetry in the cross-section; we assumed that the shearing forces were applied parallel to this
axis of symmetry. This is a relatively simple problem to treat because there can be no twisting of
the beam when a shearing force is applied parallel to the axis of symmetry. We consider now the
case when the shearing force is applied at right angles to an axis of symmetry of the cross-section.
Consider for example a channel section having an axis Cx of symmetry in the cross-section, Figure
10.11; the section is of uniform wall-thickness ¢, b is the total breadth of each flange, and A is the
distance between the flanges; C is the centroid of the cross-section. Suppose the beam is supported
at one end, and that a shearing force F is applied at the free end in a direction parallel to Cy. We
apply this shearing force at a point O on Cx such that no torsion of the channel occurs, Figure
10.12; if F is applied considerably to the left of C, twisting obviously will occur in a couriter-
clockwise direction; if F is applied considerably to the right then twisting occurs in a clockwise
direction. There is some intermediate position of O for which no twisting occurs; as we shall see
this position is not coincident with the centroid C.

Figure 10.11 Shearing of a channel cantilever.

The problem is greatly simplified if we assume that F is applied at a point O on Cx to give no
torsion of the channel; suppose O is a distance e from the centre of the web, Figure 10.12.

11 Beams of two materials

11.1 Introduction

Some beams used in engineering structures are composed of two materials. A timber joist, for
example, may be reinforced by bolting steel plates to the flanges. Plain concrete has little or no
tensile strength, and beams of this material are reinforced therefore with steel rods or wires in the
tension fibres. In beams of these types there is a composite action between the two materials.

11.2. Transformed sections

The composite beam shown in Figure 11.1 consists of a rectangular timber joist of breadth 6 and
depth A, reinforced with two steel plates of depth / and thickness ¢.

Steel . Steel
Timber

Figure 11.1 Timber beam reinforced with steel side plates.

Consider the behaviour of the composite beam under the action of a bending moment M applied
about Cx; if the timber beam is bent into a curve of radius R, then, from equation (9.5), the bending
moment carried by the timber beam is

(EN),

M = — 11.1
R (11.1)

where (£7), is the bending stiffness of the timber beam. If the steel plates are attached to the timber
beam by bolting, or glueing, or some other means, the steel plates are bent to the same radius of
curvature R as the timber beam. The bending moment carried by the two steel plates is then

Transformed sections 267

where (E/), is the bending stiffness of the two steel plates. The total bending moment is then

M = M+™M, = = (eM, + (EN,]
This gives

Clearly, the beam behaves as though the total bending stiffness E/ were

EI = (EN, + (ED, (11.3)

If E, and E, are the values of Young's modulus for timber and steel, respectively, and if /, and /, are
the second moments of area about Cx of the timber and steel beams, respectively, we have

EI = (ED, + (ED, = Ed, + El, (11.4)

Then

(11.5)

If /, is multiplied by (E/E,), which is the ratio of Young's moduli for the two materials, then from
equation (11.5) we see that the composite beam may be treated as wholly timber, having an

as shown in Figure 11.2(ii); the equivalent timber beam of Figure 11.2(ii) is the transformed
section of the beam. In this case the beam has been transformed wholly to timber. Equally the
beam may be transformed wholly to steel, as shown in Figure 11.2(iii). For bending about Cx the
breadths of the component beams are factored to find the transformed section; the depth h of the

beam is unaffected.

because the strains in the steel and timber are the same at the same distance y from the neutral axis.
This condition of equal strain is implied in the assumption made earlier that the steel and the timber
components of the beam are bent to the same radius of curvature R.

Problem 11.1. A composite beam consists of a timber joist, 15 cm by 10 cm, to which
reinforcing steel plates, 2 cm thick, are attached. Estimate the maximum
bending moment which may be applied about Cx, if the bending stress in the
timber is not to exceed 5 MN/m’, and that in the steel 120 MN/m’. Take E/E,
= 20.

Solution

The maximum bending stresses occur in the extreme fibres. If the stress in the timber is 5 MN/m’,
the stress in the steel at the same distance from Cx is

5x 10% x = = 100 x 10° Nim? = 100 MN/m

Thus when the maximum timber stress is attained, the maximum steel stress is only 100 MN/m’.
If the maximum permissible stress of 120 MN/m’ were attained in the steel, the stress in the timber

270 Beams of two materials

would exceed 5 MN/m’, which is not permissible. The maximum bending moment gives therefore
a stress in the timber of 5 MN/m’. The second moment of area about Cx of the equivalent timber

11.3. Timber beam with reinforcing steel flange plates

In Section 11.2 we discussed the composite bending action of a timber be..m reinforced with steel
plates over the depth of the beam. A similar bending problem arises when the timber joist is
reinforced on its upper and lower faces with steel plates, as shown if Figure 1 1.3(i); the timber web
of the composite beams may be transformed into steel to give the equivalent steel section of Figure
11.3(ii); alternatively, the steel flanges may be replaced by equivalent timber flanges to give the
equivalent timber beam of Figure 11.3(iii). The problem is then treated in the same way as the
beam in Section 11.2; the stresses in the timber and steel are calculated from the second moment
of area of the transformed timber and steel sections.

Figure 11.3 (i) Timber beam with reinforced steel flange plates.
(ii) Equivalent steel I-beam. (iii) Equivalent timber I-beam.

Animportant difference, however, between the composite actions of the beams of Figures 11.2
and 1 1.3 lies in their behaviour under shearing forces. The two beams, used as cantilevers carrying
end loads F, are shown in Figure 11.4; for the timber joist reinforced over the depth, Figure 11.4(i),
there are no shearing actions between the timber and the steel plates, except near the loaded ends
of the cantilever.

Timber beam with reinforcing steel flange plates 271

However, for the joist of Figure 1 1.4(i1), a shearing force is transmitted between the timber and
the steel flanges at all sections of the beam. In the particular case of thin reinforcing flanges, it is
sufficiently accurate to assume that the shearing actions in the cantilever of Figure 11.4(ii) are
resisted largely by the timber joist; on considering the equilibrium ofa unit length of the composite
beam, equilibrium is ensured if a shearing force (F/h) per unit length of beam is transmitted
between the timber joist and the reinforcing flanges, Figure 11.5. This shearing force must be
carried by bolts, glue or some other suitable means. The end deflections of the cantilevers shown
in Figure 11.4 may be difficult to estimate; this is due to the fact that account may have to be taken
of the shearing distortions of the timber beams.

because the maximum shearing force in the beam is 5 kN.

11.4 Ordinary reinforced concrete

It was noted in Chapter 1 that concrete is a brittle material which is weak in tension. Consequently
a beam composed only of concrete has little or no bending strength since cracking occurs in the
extreme tension fibres in the early stages of loading. To overcome this weakness steel rods are
embedded in the tension fibres of a concrete beam; if concrete is cast around a steel rod, on setting
the concrete shrinks and grips the steel rod. It happens that the coefficients of linear expansion of

Ordinary reinforced concrete 273

concrete and steel are very nearly equal; consequently, negligible stresses are set up by temperature
changes.

(ti)
Figure 11.6 Simple rectangular concrete beam with reinforcing steel in the tension flange.

The bending of an ordinary reinforced concrete beam may be treated on the basis of transformed
sections. Consider the beam of rectangular cross-section shown in Figure 11.6. The breadth of the
concrete is b, and h is the depth of the steel reinforcement below the upper extreme fibres. The
beam is bent so that tensile stresses occur in the lower fibres. The total area of cross-section of the
steel reinforcing rods is A; the rods are placed longitudinally in the beam. The beam is now bent
so that Ox becomes a neutral axis, compressive stresses being induced in the concrete above Ox.
We assume that concrete below the neutral axis cracks in tension, and is th-refore ineffectual; we
neglect the contribution of the concrete below Ox to the bending strength of the beam. Suppose
m is the ratio of Young's modulus of steel, E,, to Young's modulus of concrete, E,; then

If the area A of steel is transformed to concrete, its equ. valent area is mA; the equivalent concrete
beam then has the form shown in Figure 11.6(ii). The depth of the neutral axis Ox below the
extreme upper fibres is n. The equivalent concrete area mA on the tension side of the beam is
concentrated approximately at a depth A.

We have that the neutral axis of the beam occurs at the centroid of the equivalent concrete
beam; then

The area of steel reinforcement is 1.964 x 10°? m? on the tension side, and 0.982 x 10°* m’ on the

12 Bending stresses and direct stresses
combined

12.1. Introduction

Many instances arise in practice where a member undergoes bending combined with a thrust or
pull. If a member carries a thrust, direct longitudinal stresses are set up; if a bending moment is
now superimposed on the member at some section, additional longitudinal stresses are induced.

In this chapter we shall be concerned with the combined bending and thrust of short stocky
members; in such cases the presence of a thrust does not lead to overall instability of the member.
Buckling of beams under end thrust is discussed later in Chapter 18.

12.2 Combined bending and thrust of a stocky strut
Consider a short column of rectangular cross-section, Figure 1? 1(i). The column carries an axial

compressive load P, together with bending moment M, at some section, applied about the
centroidal axis Cx.

284 Bending stresses and direct stresses combined

longitudinal stress in any fibre a distance y from Cx is

for positive values of y. We assume now that the combined effect of the thrust and the bending
moment is the sum of the separate effects of P and M. The stresses due to P and M acting
separately are shown in Figure 12.1(i1i) and (iv). On combining the two stress systems, the
resultant stress in any fibre is

The two possible types of stress distribution are shown in Figure 12.2(i) and (ii). When (MA/2/,)
< (P/A), the stresses are compressive for all parts of the cross-section, Figure 12.2(i). When
(Mh/2I,) > (P/A), the stress is zero at a distance (PI,/AM) below the centre line of the beam, Figure
12.2(ii); this defines the position of the neutral axis of the column, or the axis of zero strain. In
Figure 12.2(i) the imaginary neutral axis is also a distance (P/.,/AM) from the centre line, but it lies

We can use the analysis of Section 12.2 to find the stresses due to the eccentric thrust. The column
of rectangular cross-section shown in Figure 12.3(i) carries a thrust P, which can be regarded as
concentrated at t- point D, which lies on the centroidal axis Cy, at a distance e, from C, Figure
12.3(ii). The eccentric load P is statically equivalent to an axial thrust P and a bending moment
Pe, applied about Cx, Figure 12.3(iii). Then, from equation (12.1), the longitudinal stress any fibre
is

The section AB is subjected to a tension of 2500 N, and a bending moment (2500)(0.10) = 250

Nm. The area of the section = 0.25 x 10°* m’. The direct tensile stress = (2500)/(0.25 x 107°)

12.4 Pre-stressed concrete beams

The simple analysis of Section 12.2 is useful for problems of pre-stressed concrete beams. A
concrete beam, unreinforced with steel, can withstand negligible bending loads because concrete
is so weak in tension. But if the beam be pre-compressed in some way, the tensile stresses induced
by bending actions are countered by the compressive stresses already present. In Figure 12.6, for
example, a line of blocks carries an axial thrust; if this is sufficiently large, the line of blocks can
be used in the same way as a solid beam.

Suppose a concrete beam of rectangular cross-section, Figure 12.7, carries some system of
lateral loads and is supported at its ends. An axial pre-compression P is applied at the ends. If M
is the sagging moment at any cross-section, the greatest compressive stress occurs in the extreme
top fibres, and has the value

o = {é + ) (12.14)

The stress in the extreme bottom fibres is

These two inequalities are shown graphically in Figure 12.8, in which (P/A) is plotted against

The required axial thrust for this load is

P= 34 (, - 5.) (12.22)

Some advantage is gained by pre-compressing the beam eccentrically; in Figure 12.9(i) a beam of
rectangular cross-section carries a thrust P at a depth (1/6) below the centre line. As we saw in
Section 12.3, this lies on the edge of the core of cross-section, and no tensile stresses are induced.
In the upper extreme fibres the longitudinal stress is zero, and in the lower extreme fibres the
compressive stress is 2P/A, Figure 12.9(i).

(1) (ii) (iil)
Figure 12.9 Concrete beam with eccentric pre-compression.

Now suppose a sagging bending moment M is superimposed on the beam; the extreme fibre
stresses due to M are (Mh/2/,) tensile on the lower and compressive on the upper fibres, Figure
12.9(ii). If

r 7 (12.23)

292 Bending stresses and direct stresses combined

then the resultant stresses, Figure 12.9(iii), are zero in the extreme lower fibres and a compressive
stress of (Afh/2I,) in the extreme upper fibres. If this latter compressive stress does not exceed 6,
the allowable stress in concrete, the design is safe. The maximum allowable value of M is

21,
M = —6, (12.24)

As 6, in equation (12.21) is considerably less then o,, the bending moment given by equation
(12.21) is approximately half that given by equation (12.24). Thus pre-compression by an
eccentric load gives a considerably higher bending strength.

In practice the thrust is applied to the beam either externally through rigid supports, or by
means of a stretched high-tensile steel wire passing through the beam and anchored at each end.

13 Deflections of beams

13.1. Introduction

In Chapter 7 we showed that the loading actions at any section of a simply-supported beam or
cantilever can be resolved into a bending moment and a shearing force. Subsequently, in Chapters
9 and 10, we discussed ways of estimating the stresses due to these bending moments and shearing
forces. There is, however, another aspect of the problem of bending which remains to be treated,
namely, the calculation of the stiffness of a beam. In most practical cases, it is necessary that a
beam should be not only strong enough for its purpose, but also that it should have the requisite
stiffness, that is, it should not deflect from its original position by more than a certain amount.
Again, there are certain types of beams, such as those carried by more than two supports and beams
with their ends held in such a way that they must keep their original directions, for which we
cannot calculate bending moments and shearing forces without studying the deformations of the
axis of the beam; these problems are statically indeterminate, in fact.

In this chapter we consider methods of finding the deflected form of a beam under a given
system of external loads and having known conditions of support.

13.2 Elastic bending of straight beams

It was shown in Section 9.2 that a straight beam of uniform cross-section, when subjected to end
couples M applied about a principal axis, bends into a circular arc of radius R, given by

- 4 (13.1)

where EJ, which is the product of Young's modulus £ and the second moment of area / about the
relevant principal axis, is the flexural stiffness of the beam; equation (13.1) holds only for elastic
bending.

Where a beam is subjected to shearing forces, as well as bending moments, the axis of the beam
is no longer bent to a circular arc. To deal with this type of problem, we assume that equation
(13.1) still defines the radius of curvature at any point of the beam where the bending moment is
M. This implies that where the bending moment varies from one section of the beam to another,
the radius of curvature also varies from section to section, in accordance with equation (13.1).

In the unstrained condition of the beam, Cz is the longitudinal centroidal axis, Figure 13.1, and
Cx, Cy are the principal axes in the cross-section. The co-ordinate axes Cx, Cy are so arranged that
the y-axis is vertically downwards. This is convenient as most practical loading conditions give
rise to vertically downwards deflections. Suppose bending moments are applied about axes
parallel to Cx, so that bending is restricted to the yz-plane, because Cx and Cy are principal axes.

296 Deflections of beams

Figure 13.1 Longitudinal and principal Figure 13.2 Displacements of the longitudinal
centroidal axes for a straight beam. axis of the beam.

Consider a short length of the unstrained beam, corresponding with DF on the axis Cz, Figure 13.2.
In the strained condition D and F are displaced to D' and F‘, respectively, which lies in the yz-
plane. Any point such as D on the axis Cz is displaced by an amount v parallel to Cy; it is also
displaced a small, but negligible, amount parallel to Cz.

The radius of curvature R at any section of the beam is then given by

We are concerned generally with only small deflections, in which v is small; this implies that
(dv/dz) is small, and that (dv/dz) is negligible compared with unity. Then, with sufficient
accuracy, we may write

—_ = +t.

The equations (13.1) and (13.3) give

We must now consider whether the positive or negative sign is relevant in this equation; we have
already adopted the convention in Section 7.4 that sagging bending moments are positive. When
a length of the beam is subjected to sagging bending moments, as in Figure 13.3, the value of
(dv/dz) along the length diminishes as z increases; hence a sagging moment implies that the
curvature is negative. Then

Elastic bending of straight beams 299

We can study more accurately the pure bending of a beam by considering it to be deformed into
the arc of a circle, Figure 13.5; as the bending moment M is constant at all sections of the beam,
the radius of curvature R is the same for all sections. If £ is the length between the ends, Figure
13.5, and D is the mid-point,

refinement is unimportant, and we find simple linear relationships of the type of equation (13.11)

occur at the wall and is equal to (% - 24/65) w,l’ = (17/130) wl’. If this is to be equal to % w,/’,
we must have w, = (65/17) w,; in other words, the load on the platform can be increased in the

The second relation, for z > a, may be written

Then equations (13.32) and (13.33) differ only by the last term of equation (13.34); if the last term
of equation (13.34) is discarded when z < a, then equation (13.34) may be used to define the

deflected form in all parts of the beam.
On putting z = a, the deflection at the loaded point D is

13.8 Macaulay's method

The observation that equations (13.32) and (13.33) differ only by the last term of equation (13.34)
leads to Macaulay's method, which ignores terms which are negative within the Macaulay brackets.
That is, if the term [z - a] in equation (13.34) is negative, it is ignored, so that equation (13.34) can
be used for the whole beam. The method will be demonstrated by applying it to a few examples.

Consider the beam shown in Figure 13.12, which is simply-supported at its ends and loaded
with a concentrated load W.

The term on the right of equations (13.40) and (13.41) must be integrated by the manner shown,
so that the arbitrary constants A and B apply when z < a and also when z > a. The square brackets
{ J are called Macaulay brackets and do not apply when the term inside them is negative.

The two boundary conditions are:

atz = 0, v = 0 and atz = L, vy = 0

Applying the first boundary condition to equation (13.42), we get

Applying the second boundary condition to equation (13.42), we get

If M and | M dz are integrable function of z the process of finding v can be continued analytically,
the constants A and B being found from the terminal conditions. Failing this the integrations must
be performed graphically or numerically. This is most readily done by plotting the bending-
moment curve, and from that deducing a curve of areas representing [M dz. From this curve a
third is deduced representing { [M dz dz.

13.16 Deflections of beams due to shear

In our simple theory of bending of beams, we assumed that plane sections remain plane during
bending. The effect of shearing forces in a beam is to distort plane cross-sections into curved
planes. In the cantilever of Figure 13.21, the cross-section DH warps as the force F is applied, due
to the shearing strains in the fibres of the beam. We assume that the shearing stresses set up by F
are distributed in the manner already discussed in Chapter 10. This is not true strictly, because
shearing distortions no longer allow sections to remain plane; however, we assume these shearing
effects are secondary, and we are justified therefore in estimating them on our original theory.

14 Built-in and continuous beams

14.1. Introduction

In all our investigations of the stresses and deflections of beams having two supports, we have
supposed that the supports exercise no constraint on bending of the beam, i.e. the axis of the beam
has been assumed free to take up any inclination to the line of supports. This has been necessary
because, without knowing how to deal with the deformation of the axis of the beam, we were not
in a position to find the bending moments on a beam when the supports constrain the direction of
the axis. We shall now investigate this problem. When the ends of a beam are fixed in direction
so that the axis of the beam has to retain its original direction at the points of support, the beam is
said to be built-in or direction fixed.

Consider a straight beam resting on two supports A and B (Figure 14.1) and carrying vertical
loads. If there is no constraint on the axis of the beam, it will become curved in the manner shown
by broken lines, the extremities of the beam rising off the supports.

Figure 14.1 Beam with end couples.

In order to make the ends of the beam lie flat on the horizontal supports, we shall have to apply
couples as shown by M, and M,. If the beam is firmly built into two walls, or bolted down to two
piers, or in any way held so that the axis cannot tip up at the ends in the manner indicated, the
couples such as M, and M, are supplied by the resistance of the supports to deformation. These
couples are termed fixed-end moments, and the main problem of the built-in beam is the
determination of these couples; when we have found these we can draw the bending moment
diagram and calculate the stresses in the usual way. The couples M, and M, in Figure 14.1 must
be such as to produce curvature in the opposite direction to that caused by the loads.

14.2 Built-in beam with a single concentrated load

We may deduce the bending moments in a built-in beam under any conditions of lateral loading
from the case of a beam under a single concentrated lateral load.

Consider a uniform beam, of flexural stiffness E/, and length L, which is built-in to end

a distance a from C. If M- and M, are the restraining moments at the supports, then the vertical
reaction is at C is

14.3 Fixed-end moments for other loading conditions

The built-in beam of Figure 14.4 carries a uniformly distributed load of w per unit length over the
section of the beam fromz = atoz = b.

Figure 14.4 Distributed load over part of the span of a built-in beam.

and this induces a retraining moment at C of amount

14.4 Disadvantages of built-in beams

The results we have obtained above show that a beam which has its ends firmly fixed in direction
is both stronger and stiffer than the same beam with its ends simply-supported. On this account

Effect of sinking of supports 345

it might be supposed that beams would always have their ends built-in whenever possible; in
practice it is not often done. There are several objections to built-in beams: in the first place a
small subsidence of one of the supports will tend to set up large stresses, and, in erection, the
supports must be aligned with the utmost accuracy; changes of temperature also tend to set up large
stresses. Again, in the case of live loads passing over bridges, the frequent fluctuations of bending
moment, and vibrations, would quickly tend to make the degree of fixing at the ends extremely
uncertain.

Most of these objections can be obviated by employing the double cantilever construction. As
the bending moments at the ends of a built-in beam are of opposite sign to those in the central part
of the beam, there must be points of inflexion, i.e. points where the bending moment is zero. At
these points a hinged joint might be made in the beam, the axis of the hinge being parallel to the
bending axis, because there is no bending moment to resist. If this is done at each point of
inflexion, the beam will appear as a central girder freely supported by two end cantilevers; the
bending moment curve and deflection curve will be exactly the same as if the beam were solid and
built in. With this construction the beam is able to adjust itself to changes of temperature or
subsistence of the supports.

14.5 Effect of sinking of supports

When the ends of a beam are prevented from rotating but allowed to deflect with respect to each
other, bending moments are set up in the beam. The uniform beam of Figure 14.8 is displaced so
that no rotations occur at the ends but the remote end is displaced downwards an amount 6 relative
to C.

The end reactions consist of equal couples M, and equal and opposite shearing forces 2M_/L,
because the system is antisymmetric about the mid-point of the beam. The half-length of the beam
behaves as a cantilever carrying an end load 2M,L; then, from equation (13.18),

14.6 Continuous beam

When the same beam muns across three or more supports it is spoken of as a continuous beam.
Suppose we have three spans, as in Figure 14.9, each bridged by a separate beam; the beams will
bend independently in the manner shown. In order to make the axes of the three beams form a
single continuous curve across the supports B and C, we shall have to apply to each beam couples
acting as shown by the arrows. When the beam is one continuous girder these couples, on any bay
such as BC, are supplied by the action of the adjacent bays. Thus AB and CD, bending downwards
under their own loads, try to bend BC upwards, as shown by the broken curve, thus applying the
couples M, and M, to the bay BC. This upward bending is of course opposed by the down load
on BC, and the general result is that the beam takes up a sinuous form, being, in general, concave
upwards over the middle portion of each bay and convex upwards over the supports.

Slope deflection equations for a single beam 347

Figure 14.9 Bending moments at the supports of a continuous beam.

In order to draw the bending moment diagram for a continuous beam we must first find the couples
such as M, and M,.. In some cases there may also be external couples applied to the beam, at the
supports, by the action of other members of the structure.

When the bending moments at the supports have been found, the bending moment and shearing
force diagrams can be drawn for each bay according to the methods discussed in Chapter 7.

14.7 Slope-deflection equations for a single beam

In dealing with continuous beams we can make frequent use of the end slope and deflection
properties of a single beam under any conditions of lateral loading. The uniform beam of Figure
14.10(1) carries any system of lateral loads; the ends are supported in an arbitrary fashion, the
displacements and moments being as shown in the figure. In addition there are lateral forces at the
supports. The rotations at the supports are 8, and 0,, respectively, reckoned positive if clockwise;
M, and M, are also taken positive clockwise for our present purposes. The displacements 5, and
5, are taken positive downwards.

The loaded beam of Figure 14.10(i) may be regarded as the superposition of the loading
conditions of Figures 14.10(ii) and (iii). In Figure 14.10(ii) the beam is built-in at each end; the
moments at each end are easily calculable from the methods discussed in Sections 14.2 and 14.3.
The fixed-end moments for this condition will be denoted by M,, and M,,. In Figure 14.10(iii)
the beam carries no external loads between its ends, but end displacements and rotations are the
same as those in Figure 14.10(i); the end couples for this condition are M,' and M,'. The
superposition of Figures 14.10(it) and (iii) gives the external loading and end conditions of Figure
14.10(i). We must find then the end couples in Figure 14.10(iii); from equations (13.49), putting

15 Plastic bending of mild-steel beams

15.1 Introduction

We have seen that in the bending of a beam the greatest direct stresses occur in the extreme
longitudinal fibres; when these stresses attain the yield-point values, or exceed the limit of
proportionality, the distribution of stresses over the depth of the beams no longer remains linear,
as in the case of elastic bending.

The general problem of the plastic bending of beams is complicated; plastic bending of a beam
is governed by the forms of the stress-strain curves of the material in tension and compression.
Mild steel, which is used extensively as a structural material, has tensile and compressive
properties which lend themselves to a relatively simple treatment of the plastic bending of beams
of this material. The tensile and compressive stress-strain curves for an annealed mild steel have
the forms shown in Figure 15.1; in the elastic range Young's modulus is the same for tension and
compression, and of the order of 300 MN/m’. The yield point corresponds to a strain of the order
0.0015. When the strain corresponding with the upper yield point is exceeded straining takes place
continuously at a constant lower yield stress until a strain of about 0.015 is attained; at this stage
further straining is accompanied by an increase in stress, and the material is said to strain-harden.
This region of strain-hardening begins at strains about ten times larger than the strains at the yield
point of the material.

Figure 15.1 Tensile and compressive stress-strain curves of an annealed mild steel.

In applying these stress-strain curves to the plastic bending of mild-steel beams we simplify the
problem by ignoring the upper yield point of the material; we assume the material is elastic, with
a Young's modulus £, up to a yield stress o,; Figure 15.2. We assume that the yield stress, o,, and
Young's modulus, £, are the same for tension and compression. These idealised stress—strain
curves for tension and compression are then similar in form.

15.2 Beam of rectangular cross-section

As an example of the application of these idealised stress—strain curves for mild steel, consider the
uniform bending of a beam of rectangular cross-section; b is the breadth of the cross-section and
h its depth, Figure 15.3(i). Equal and opposite moments M are applied to the ends of a length of
the beam. We found that in the elastic bending of a rectangular beam there is a linear distribution
of direct stresses over a cross-section of the beam; an axis at the mid-depth of the cross-section is
unstrained and therefore a neutral axis. The stresses are greatest in the extreme fibres of the beam;
the yield stress, o,, is attained in the extreme fibres, Figure 15.3(ii), when

where / is the second moment of area of the cross-section about the axis of bending. But

My, = raids (15.1)

As the beam is bent beyond this initial yielding condition, experiment shows that plane cross-
sections of the beam remain nearly plane as in the case of elastic bending. The centroidal axis
remains a neutral axis during inelastic bending, and the greatest strains occur in the extreme tension
and compression fibres. But the stresses in these extreme fibres cannot exceed o,, the yield stress;
at an intermediate stage in the bending of the beam the central core is still elastic, but the extreme
fibres have yielded and become plastic, Figure 15.3(iii).

If the curvature of the beam is increased the elastic core is diminished in depth; finally a
condition is reached where the elastic core is reduced to negligible proportions, and the beam is
more or less wholly plastic, Figure 15.3(iv); in this final condition there is still a central unstrained,
or neutral, axis; fibres above the neutral axis are stressed to the yield point in tension, whereas
fibres below the neutral axis to the yield point are in compression. In the ultimate fully plastic
condition the resultant longitudinal tension in the upper half-depth of the beam is

—bho
2 Y

There is an equal resultant compression in the lower half-depth. There is, therefore, no resultant
longitudinal thrust in the beam; the bending moment for this fully plastic condition is

1 1 l
M, = |—bho,|}—h| = —bh’s 15.2
P 2 { 2 4 Y ( )

This ultimate moment is usually called the fully plastic moment of the beam; comparing equations
(15.1) and (15.2) we get

3
Mp = <M, (15.3)

Thus plastic collapse of a rectangular beam occurs at a moment 50% greater than the bending
moment at initial yielding of the beam.

15.3 Elastic—plastic bending of a rectangular mild-steel beam

In section 15.2 we introduced the concept of a fully plastic moment, M,, of a mild-steel beam; this
moment is attained when all longitudinal fibres of the beam are stressed into the plastic range of
the material. Between the stage at which the yield stress is first exceeded and the ultimate stage
at which the fully plastic moment is attained, some fibres at the centre of the beam are elastic and
those remote from the centre are plastic. At an intermediate stage the bending is elastic—plastic.

Elastic—plastic bending of a rectangular mild-steel beam

Consider again a mild-steel beam of rectangular cross-section, Figure 15.4, which is bent about
the centroidal axis Cx. In the elastic-plastic range, a central region of depth /, remains elastic;
the yield stress 6, is attained in fibres beyond this central elastic core. If the central region of depth

h, behaves as an elastic beam, the radius of curvature, R, is given by

The cross-sectional dimensions of an I-section are shown in Figure 15.6; in the fully plastic

Then

Zp = (0.1)(0.010)(0.2 - 0.010) + ~(0.007)(0.2 - 0.020 = 0.247 x 10° m?

Thus, in this case, the fully plastic moment is only 10% greater than the moment at initial yielding.
The ratio (Z,/Z,) is sometimes called the shape factor.

15.5 More general case of plastic bending

In the case of the rectangular and I-section beams treated so far, the neutral axis of bending
coincided with an axis of symmetry of the cross-section. For a section that is unsymmetrical about
the axis of bending, the position of the neutral axis must be found first. The beam in Figure 15.7
has one axis of symmetry, Oy; the beam is bent into the fully plastic condition about Ox, which is
perpendicular to Oy. The axis Ox is the neutral axis of bending; the total longitudinal force on the
fibres above Ox is A,c,, where A, is the area of the cross-section of the beam above Ox. If A, is
the area of the cross-section below Ox, the total longitudinal force on the fibres below Ox is A,oy.
If there is no resultant longitudinal thrust in the beam, then

15.7 Regions of plasticity in a simply-supported beam

The miid-steel beam shown in Figure 15.8 has a rectangular cross-section; it is sumply-supported
at each end, and carries a central lateral load W. The variation of bending moment has the form
shown in Figure 15.8(ii); the greatest bending moment occurs under the central load and has the
value WL/4. From the preceding analysis we see that a section may take an increasing bending
moment until the fully plastic moment M, of the section is reached. The ultimate strength of the
beam is reached therefore when

15.8 Plastic collapse of a built-in beam

A uniform beam of length L is built-in at each end to rigid walls, and carries a uniformly
distributed load w per unit length, Figure 15.11. If the material remains elastic, the bending
moment at each end is wl7/12, and at the mid-length wZ’/24. The bending moment is therefore
greatest at the end supports; if yielding occurs first at a bending moment My, then the lateral load

Plastic collapse of a built-in beam 365

If the load w is increased beyond the limit of elasticity, plastic hinges first develop at the remote
ends. The beam only becomes a mechanism when a third plastic hinge develops at the mid-length.
On considering the statical equilibrium of a half-span of the beam we find that the moments at the
ends and the mid-length, for plastic hinges at these sections, are

2
M, = a (15.33)
or
16M,
wl = — (15.34)

Clearly, the load causing complete collapse is at least one-third greater than that at which initial
yielding begins because M, is greater than M,.

Another method of plastically analysing the beam of Figure 15.11 is by the principle of virtual
work described in Chapter 17. In this case the beam is assumed to collapse in the form of a
mechanism, when three plastic hinges form, as shown in Figure 15.12.

As the beam is encastré at both ends, it is statically indeterminate to the second degree,
therefore three hinges are required to change it from a beam structure to a mechanism.

Hogging hinge Hogging hinge

Figure 15.12 Plastic collapse of a beam.

Thus, because the beam cannot resist further loading at the three hinges, the slightest increase
in load causes the hinges to rotate like ‘rusty’ hinges. Additionally, as the bending moment
distribution is constant during this collapse, the curvature of the beam remains constant during
collapse. Hence, for the purpose of analysis, the beam's two sections can be assumed to remain
straight during collapse.

16 Torsion of circular shafts and
thin-walled tubes

16.1. Introduction

In Chapter 3 we introduced the concepts of shearing stress and shearing strain; these have an
important application in torsion problems. Such problems arise in shafts transmitting heavy
torques, in eccentrically loaded beams, in aircraft wings and fuselages, and many other instances.
These problems are very complex in general, and at this elementary stage we can go no further than
studying uniform torsion of circular shafts, thin-walled tubes, and thin-walled open sections.

16.2. Torsion of a thin circular tube

The simplest torsion problem is that of the twisting of a uniform thin circular tube; the tube shown
in Figure 16.1 is of thickness ¢, and the mean radius of the wall is 7, Z is the length of the tube.
Shearing stresses t are applied around the circumference of the tube at each end, and in opposite
directions.

Figure 16.1 Torsion of a thin-walled circular tube.

If the stresses t are uniform around the boundary, the total torque T at each end of the tube is

T = (2nrt)t = 2nr?t 1 (16.1)

Thus the shearing stress around the circumference due to an applied torque T is
r (16.2)
T= .
Qnr’t


368 Torsion of circular shafts and thin-walled tubes

We consider next the strains caused by these shearing stresses. We note firstly that
complementary shearing stresses are set up in the wall parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tube.
If ds is a small length of the circumference then an element of the wall ABCD, Figure 16.1, is in
a state of pure shearing stress. If the remote end of the tube is assumed not to twist, then the
longitudinal element ABCD is distorted into the parallelogram ABC'D’, Figure 16.1, the angle of
shearing strain being

y = (16.3)

+
G

if the material is elastic, and has a shearing (or rigidity) modulus G. But if 0 is the angle of twist
of the near end of the tube we have

yL = # (16.4)
Hence
_ yh _ ow
6 = a = Gr (16.5)

It is sometimes more convenient to define the twist of the tube as the rate of change of twist per
unit length; this is given by (0/L), and from equation (16.5) this is equal to
T

GS (16.6)

16.3. Torsion of solid circular shafts

The torsion of a thin circular tube is a relatively simple problem as the shearing stress may be
assumed constant throughout the wall thickness. The case ofa solid circular shaft is more complex
because the shearing stresses are variable over the cross-section of the shaft. The solid circular
shaft of Figure 16.2 has a length Z and radius a in the cross-section.

Figure 16.2 Torsion of a solid circular shaft.

Torsion of solid circular shafts 369

When equal and opposite torques 7 are applied at each end about a longitudinal axis we assume
that

(i) the twisting is uniform along the shaft, that is, all normal cross-sections the same
distance apart suffer equal relative rotation;

(ii) cross-sections remain plane during twisting; and
(iii) radii remain straight during twisting.

If @ is the relative angle of twist of the two ends of the shaft, then the shearing strain y of an
elemental tube of thickness 657 and at radius r is

Yrs (16.7)

If the material is elastic, and has a shearing (or rigidity) modulus G, Section 3.4, then the
circumferential shearing stress on this elemental tube is

Grb
t= Gy = = (16.8)

The thickness of the elemental tube is 57, so the total torque on this tube is

We see from equation (16.8) that t increases linearly with r, from zero at the centre of the shaft to
Ga@/L at the circumference. Along any radius of the cross-section, the shearing stresses are normal
to the radius and in the plane of the cross-section, Figure 16.3.

16.4 Torsion of a hollow circular shaft

It frequently arises that a torque is transmitted by a hollow circular shaft. Suppose a, and a, are
the internal and external radii, respectively, of such a shaft, Figure 16.4. We make the same
general assumptions as in the torsion of a solid circular shaft. If t is the shearing stress at radius

r, the total torque on the shaft is

T = i 2nr?tdr

16.5 Principal stresses in a twisted shaft

It is important to appreciate that uniform torsion of circular shafts, of the form discussed in Section
16.3, involves no shearing between concentric elemental tubes of the shaft. Shearing stresses t
occur in a cross-section of the shaft, and complementary shearing stresses parallel to the
longitudinal axis, Figure 16.5.

Figure 16.5 Principal stresses in the outer surface of a twisted circular shaft.

Torsion combined with thrust or tension 375

An element ABCD in the surface of the shaft is in a state of pure shear. The principal plane
makes angles of 45° with the axis of the shaft, therefore, and the principal stresses are +t. If the
element ABCD is square, then the principal planes are AC and BD. The direct stress on AC is
compressive and of magnitude 1; the direct stress on BD is tensile and of the same magnitude.
Principal planes such as AC cut the surface of the shaft in a helix; for a brittle material, weak in
tension, we should expect breakdown in a torsion test to occur by tensile fracture along planes such
as BD. The failure of a twisted bar of a brittle material is shown in Figure 16.6.

Figure 16.6 Failure in torsion of a circular bar of brittle cast iron, showing a tendency
to tensile fracture across a helix on the surface of the specimen.

The torsional failure of ductile materials occurs when the shearing stresses attain the yield stress
of the material. The greatest shearing stresses in a circular shaft occur in a cross-section and along
the length of the shaft. A circular bar of a ductile material usually fails by breaking off over a
normal cross-section, as shown in Figure 16.7.

Figure 16.7 Failure of torsion of a circular bar of ductile cast iron, showing a
shearing failure over a normal cross-section of the bar.

16.6 Torsion combined with thrust or tension

When a circular shaft is subjected to longitudinal thrust, or tension, as well as twisting, the direct
stresses due to the longitudinal load must be combined with the shearing stresses due to torsion in
order to evaluate the principal stresses in the shaft. Suppose the shaft is axially loaded in tension
so that there is a longitudinal direct stress o at all points of the shaft.

If t is the shearing stress at any point, then we are interested in the principal stresses of the

system shown in Figure 16.8; for this system the principal stresses, from equations (5.12), have the
values

and the maximum shearing stress, from equation (5.14), is

Solution

It will be easier, and sufficiently accurate, to neglect the variation in the shearing stress from the
inside to the outside of the tube. Let

In Section 16.3 we found that the torque—twist relationship for a circular shaft has the form

GJ

T =

This shows that the angle of twist, 8, of one end relative to the other, increases linearly with T. If
one end of the shaft is assumed to be fixed, then the work done in twisting the other end through
an angle @ is the area under the 7-0 relationship, Figure 16.9. This work is conserved in the shaft
as strain energy, which has the value

U = 578 (16.19)

16.8 Plastic torsion of a circular shaft

When a circular shaft is twisted the shearing stresses are greatest in the surface of the shaft. If the
limit of proportionality of the material in shear is at a stress t,, then this stress is first attained in
the surface of the shaft at a torque

Jty

T = (16.21)

a

where J is the polar second moment of area, and a is the radius of the cross-section.

Suppose the material has the idealised shearing stress—strain curve shown in Figure 16.10;
behaviour is elastic up to a shearing stress t,, the shearing modulus being G. Beyond the limit of
proportionality shearing proceeds at a constant stress t, This behaviour is nearly true of mild steel
with a well-defined yield point.

If we are dealing with a solid circular shaft, then after the onset of plasticity in the surface fibres
the shearing stresses vary radially in the form shown in Figure 16.11. The material within a radius
b is still elastic; the material beyond a radius b is plastic and is everywhere stressed to the yield

shearing stress t and strain y can be deduced. The resulting variation of t and y is called the

tensile and compressive stress-strain curves, as shown in Figure 16.13. In the elastic range of a

It is important to appreciate that the shearing stress-strain curve cannot be directly deduced
from a torsion test of a solid circular bar, although the limit of proportionality can be estimated
reasonably accurately.

16.9 Torsion of thin tubes of non-circular cross-section

In general the problem of the torsion of a shaft of non-circular cross-section is a complex one; in
the particular case when the shaft is a hollow thin tube we can develop, however, a simple theory
giving results that are sufficiently accurate for engineering purposes.

Consider a thin-walled closed tube of uniform section throughout its length. The thickness of
the wall at any point is ¢, Figure 16.14, although this may vary at points around the circumference
of the tube. Suppose torques 7 are applied to each end so that the tube twists about a longitudinal
axis Cz. We assume that the torque 7 is distributed over the end of the tube in the form of shearing
stresses which are parallel to the tangent to the wall at any point, Figure 16.14, and that the ends
of the tube are free from axial restraint. If the shearing stress at any point of the circumference is
t, then an equal complementary shearing stress is set up along the length of the tube. Consider the
equilibrium of the section ABCD of the wall: if the shearing stress t at any point is uniform
throughout the wal! thickness then the shearing force transmitted over the edge BC is tt per unit
length.

Torsion of thin tubes of non-circular cross-section 383

tt/unit length

tt/unit length

Figure 16.14 Torsion of a thin-walled tube of any cross-section.

For longitudinal equilibrium of ABCD we must have that t¢ on BC is equal and opposite to tt
on AD; but the section ABCD is an arbitrary one, and we must have that t¢ is constant for all parts
of the tube. Suppose this constant value of tr is

w= q (16.35)

The symbol ‘g’ is called the shear flow; it has the units of a load per unit length of the
circumference of the tube.

Suppose we measure a distance s round the tube from some point O on the circumference,
Figure 16.14. The force acting along the tangent to an element of length ds in the cross-section is
ttés. Suppose r is the length of the perpendicular from the centre of twist C onto the tangent. Then
the moment of the force tt5s about C is

ttrds

The total torque on the cross-section of the tube is therefore
T = grinds (16.36)

where the integration is carried out over the whole of the circumference. But tf is constant and
equal to q for all values of s. Then

T= wags = agras (16.37)

Now § rds is twice the area, 4, enclosed by the centre line of the wall of the tube, and so

T = 2Aq (16.38)

The shearing stress at any point is then

- 4.2
TT Oh (16.39)

To find the angle of twist of the tube we consider the strain energy stored in the tube, and equate
this to the work done by the torques 7 in twisting the tube. When a material is subjected to
shearing stresses t the strain energy stored per unit volume of material is, from equation (3.5),

am
2G

where G is the shearing (or rigidity) modulus of the material. In the tube the shearing stresses are
varying around the circumference but not along the length of the tube. Then the strain energy
stored in a longitudinal element of length Z, width 5s and thickness f is

The total strain energy stored in the tube is therefore

A long flat strip of rectangular cross-section has a breadth 4, thickness t, and length L. For uniform
torsion about the centroid of the cross-section, the strip may be treated as a set of concentric thin

hollow tubes, all twisted by the same amount.

Consider such an elemental tube which is rectangular in shape the longer sides being a distance

that their directions reverse over the thickness of the strip. This approximate solution gives an

17 Energy methods

17.1. Introduction

Energy methods are very useful for analysing structures, especially for those that are statically
indeterminate. This chapter introduces the principle of virtual work and applies it to statically
determinate and statically indeterminate frameworks. The chapter also shows how the method can
be used for the plastic design of beams and rigid-jointed plane frames.

The chapter then introduces strain energy and complementary strain energy, and through the
use of worked examples, shows how these methods can be used for analysing structures.

In Chapters 24 and 25, energy methods are used for developing the finite element method,
which is one of the most powerful methods for analysing massive and complex structures with the
aid of digital computers.

17.2. Principle of virtual work
In its simplest form the principle of virtual work is that

For a system of forces acting on a particle, the particle is in statical equilibrium if,
when it is given any virtual displacement, the net work done by the forces is zero.

A virtual displacement is any arbitrary displacement of the particle. In the virtual displacement the
forces are assumed to remain constant and parallel to their original lines of actions. Consider a
particle under the action of three forces, F,, F, and F,, Figure 17.1.

Figure 17.1 System of forces in statical equilibrium acting on a particle.

Imagine the particle to be given a virtual displacement of any magnitude in any direction.
Suppose the displacements of the particle along the lines of action of the forces F,, F, and F,, are
5,, 5, and 5,, respectively; these are known as corresponding displacements. Then the forces form
a system in statical equilibrium if

Deflections of beams 391
F,8, + F,6, + F,6, = 0 (17.1)

On the basis of the principle of virtual work we can show that the resultant of the forces acting on
a particle in statical equilibrium is zero. Suppose the forces F,, F, and F;, acting on the particle
of Figure 17.1, have a resultant of magnitude R in some direction; then by giving the particle a
suitable virtual displacement, A, say, in the direction of R, the net work is

RA
But by the principle of virtual work the net work is zero, so that
RA = 0 (17.2)

As Acan be non-zero, R must be zero. Hence, by adopting the principle of virtual work as a basic
concept, we can show that the resultant of a system of forces in statical equilibrium is zero.

17.3. Deflections of beams

In a pin-jointed frame subjected to loads applied to the joints only the tensile load in any member
is constant throughout the length of that member. In the case of a beam under lateral loads the
bending moments and shearing forces may vary from one section to another, so that the state of
stress is not uniform along the length of the beam. In applying the principle of virtual work to
problems of beams we must consider the loading actions on the virtual displacement of an
elemental length of the beam.

Figure 17.2 Deflections of a straight beam.

Consider a straight beam AB, Figure 17.2, which is in statical equilibrium under the action of
a system of external forces and couples. The beam is divided into a number of short lengths; the
loading actions on a short length such as 5z consist of bending moments M and (M + 6M), an
external lateral load W, and lateral shearing forces at the ends of the short length. Now suppose

392 Energy methods
the short lengths of the beam are given small virtual displacements, 6. If the elements remain
connected to each other, then for given values of 6 the external forces, such as W, suffer certain
displacements, such as 5. Then the values of @ and 5 form a compatible system of rotations and
displacements, and the virtual work of any system of forces and couples in statical in equilibrium
on these rotations and displacements is zero. Then

YbMx8+>) Wx 6 = 0 (17.3)

because the net work of the internal shearing forces is zero. The summation 26M ~ 6 is carried out
for all short lengths of the beam, whereas the summation ZW ~ 6 is carried out for all external
loads, including couples and force reactions at points of support. If the virtual rotations 6 are
small, the virtual displacements 6 can be found easily. If the lengths 5z of the beam are
infinitesimally small,

Yo smx@ = [1 9am (17.4)

=0

where the integration is carried out over the whole length Z of the beam. But

[07 eam = | ~ f Maop

Now
[MO =5 = (MOL, - (ML .,

and is the work of the end couples on their respective virtual displacements; this work has already
been taken account of in the summation LW ~ 5, so that equation (17.3) becomes

Ywxs = f Ma = pom) dz (17.5)

Now (d6/dz) is the curvature of the beam when it is given the virtual rotations and displacements.
If we put

—- FT (17.6)
where R is the radius of curvature of the beam, then

Ywxs = ok (17.7)

having a uniform flexural stiffness E/. The cantilever carries a vertical load W at the free end; the

discussed in the preceding problems. It is useful, for example, in solving problems of plastic
bending; the uniform mild-steel beam of Figure 17.5 has a fully-plastic moment M,. At collapse
of the beam, plastic hinges develop at A and B. Suppose the point B is now given a virtual
displacement 4; if 6 is small, AB rotates through an angle (5/a), and BC through an angle [d/(L -

17.7 Complementary energy

The principle of virtual work leads also to a concept of wider application in stress—strain analysis
than that of strain energy; this other property of a structure is known as complementary energy.

Consider the statically determinate pin-jointed frame shown in Figure 17.6; the frame is pinned
to a rigid foundation at A and B, and carries external loads W, and W, at joints C and D,
respectively. Suppose the corresponding displacements of the joints C and D are 4,, and 6.,,
respectively; the tensile force induced in a typical member, such as BC, is P, and its resulting
extension is e. The forces W,, W,, P etc. are a system of forces in statical equilibrium, whereas
the extensions, e, etc., are compatible with the displacements 5, and 6, of the joints. Thus by the
principle of virtual work

W8, + W,8, = ¥ Pe (17.18)

where the summation is carried out for all member of the frame.

Fig. 17.6 Statically determinate plane frame under any system of external load.

Now suppose the external load W, is increased in magnitude by a small amount 5W,, the external
load W, remaining unchanged; due to change in W, small changes occur in the forces in the

414 Energy methods

members of the frame P, for example, increasing to (P + dP). Now consider the virtual work of
the modified system of forces on the original set of displacements and extensions; we have

(W, + dW, 8, + W,8, = )O (P + SPle

m

where the summation is carried out for all members of the frame. Now suppose the external load
W, is increased in magnitude by a small amount 6W,, the external load W, remaining unchanged;
due to change in W, small changes occur in the forces in the members of the frame, P, for example,
increasing to (P + dP).

Now consider the virtual work of the modified system of forces on the original set of
displacement and extensions; we have

(W, + 5W,B, + W,8, = YO (P + dPe (17.19)

m

On subtracting equations (17.18) and (17.19), we have

5, x 8W, = > edP (17.20)

The quantity edP for a member is the shaded elemental area shown on the load-extension diagram
of Figure 17.7, this is an element of the area C shown in Figure 17.8.

When a bar is extended the work done on the bar is the area below the P-e curve of Figure 17.7,
for a conservative structural member this work is stored as strain energy, which we have already
referred to as U. We define the area above the P-e curve of Figure 17.7 as the complementary
energy, C, of the member; we have that

U+C = Pe (17.21)
and

Complementary energy in problems of bending 415
6C = edP (17.22)

In equation (17.18) we may write, therefore,

8, x 8W, = 6C (17.23)

where C is the complementary energy of all members of the frame. If 5W, is infinitesimally small

Then the partial derivative of the complementary energy function C with respect to the external
load W, gives the corresponding displacement 6, of that load.

17.8 Complementary energy in problems of bending
The complementary energy method may be used to considerable advantage in the solution of
problems of bending of straight and thin curved beams. In general we suppose that the

moment—curvature relationship for an element of a beam is of the form shown in Figure 17.9. The
complementary energy of bending of an elemental length ds due to a bending moment M is

18 Buckling of columns and beams

18.1. Introduction

In all the problems treated in preceding chapters, we were concerned with the small strains and
distortions of a stressed material. In certain types of problems, and especially those involving
compressive stresses, we find that a structural member may develop relatively large distortions
under certain critical loading conditions. Such structural members are said to buckle, or become
unstable, at these critical loads.

As an example of elastic buckling, we consider firstly the buckling of a slender column under
an axial compressive load.

18.2 Flexural buckling of a pin-ended strut

A perfectly straight bar of uniform cross-section has two axes of symmetry Cx and Cy in the cross-
section on the right of Figure 18.1. We suppose the bar to be a flat strip of material, Cx being the
weakest axis of the cross-section. End thrusts P are applied along the centroidal axis Cz of the bar,
and £/ its uniform flexural stiffness for bending about Cx.

Figure 18.1 Flexural buckling of a pin-ended strut under axial thrust.

Now Cx is the weakest axis of bending of the bar, and if bowing of the compressed bar occurs
we should expect bending to take place in the yz-plane. Consider the possibility that at some value
of P, the end thrust, the strut can buckle laterally in the yz-plane. There can be no lateral
deflections at the ends of the strut; suppose v is the displacement of the centre line of the bar
parallel to Cy at any point. There can be no forces at the hinges parallel to Cy, as these would
imply bending moments at the ends of the bar. The only two external forces are the end thrusts P,
which are assumed to maintain their original line of action after the onset of buckling. The bending

Flexural buckling of a pin-ended strut 425

moment at any section of the bar is then
M = Py (18.1)
which is a sagging moment in relation to the axes Cz and Cy, in the sense of Section 13.2. But the

moment—curvature relationship for the beam at any section is

Then

Put

Then

The general solution of this differential equation is
v = Acos kz + B sin kz (18.5)

where A and B are arbitrary constants. We have two boundary conditions to satisfy: at the ends z
= QOandz =L,v = 0. Then

A = 0 and BsinkL = 0

Now consider the implications of the equation

BsinkL = 0

which is derived from the boundary conditions. If B = 0, then both A and B are zero, and
obviously the strut is undeflected.

If, however, sin kL = 0, B is indeterminate, and the strut may assume the form

v = B sin kz

This is called a buckled condition of the strut. Obviously B is indeterminate when kL, assumes the
values,

kL = nm, 2n,... ete. (18.6)

We need not consider the solution AL = 0, which implies k = 0, because the solution of the
differential equation is not trigonometric in form when k = 0. Instability occurs when kLa, = 27,
etc.

There are infinite number of values of P for instability, corresponding with various modes of

This is known as the Euler formula and corresponds with buckling in a single longitudinal half-
wave. The critical load

2 re (18.9)

Flexural buckling of a pin-ended strut 427

corresponds with buckling in two longitudinal half-waves, and so on for higher modes. In practice
the critical load P, is never exceeded because high stresses develop at this load and collapse of the
‘strut ensues. We are not therefore concerned with buckling loads higher than the lowest buckling
load. For all practical purposes the buckling load of a pin-ended strut is given by equation (18.8).

At this load a perfectly straight pin-ended strut is in a state of neutral equilibrium, the small
deflection

v= Bsink

is indeterminate, because B itself is indeterminate. Theoretically, the strut is in equilibrium at the
load r’EI/L’ for any small value of B, corresponding with a condition of neutral equilibrium; at this
buckling load we should expect to be able to push the strut into any sinusoidal wave of small
amplitude. This can be verified experimentally by compressing a long slender strip of material
which remains elastic during bending.

At values of P less than x”E//L’ the strut is in a condition of unstable equilibrium; any small
lateral disturbance produces motion and finally collapse of the strut. This, however, is a
hypothetical situation as, in practice, the load n”E//L’ cannot be exceeded if the loads are static, and
not applied suddenly.

The condition of neutral equilibrium at

ell

is only attained for small lateral displacements of the strut. When these displacements become
large, the moment-curvature relation

2
M = - HITS

is no longer valid; theoretically the problem becomes more difficult. The effect of large lateral
displacements is to increase the flexural stiffness of the strut; in this case, provided the material
remains elastic, end thrusts greater than x’E//L’ are attainable. If the thrust P is plotted against the
lateral displacement v at any section, the P - v relation for a perfectly straight strut has the form
shown in Figure 18.3(i), when account is taken of large deflections. Lateral deflections become
possible only when

18.3. Rankine-Gordon formula

Predictions of buckling loads by the Euler formula is only reasonable for very long and slender
struts that have very small geometrical imperfections. In practice, however, most struts suffer
plastic knockdown and the experimentally obtained buckling loads are much less than the Euler
predictions. For struts in this category, a suitable formula is the Rankine—Gordon formula which
is a semi-empirical formula, and takes into account the crushing strength of the material, its
Young's modulus and its slenderness ratio, namely L/k, where

L = length of the strut

18.6 Pin-ended strut with eccentric end thrusts

In practice it is difficult, ifnot impossible, to apply the end thrusts along the longitudinal centroidal
axis Cz of a strut. We consider now the effect of an eccentrically applied compressive load P on
a uniform strut of flexural stiffness E/ and length L.

Figure 18.6 Eccentric loading of a strut.

Suppose the end thrusts are applied at a distance e from the centroid and on the axis Cy of the
cross-section. We assume again that the cross-section is that of a flat rectangular strip, Cx being
the weaker axis of bending. The end thrusts P are applied to rigid arms attached to the ends of the
strut.

An end load P causes the straight strut to bend; suppose v is the displacement of any point on
Cz from its original position. The bending moment at that section is

which is a sagging moment in relation to the axes Cz and Cy. If v is small we have

Thus values of v, are possible from the onset of loading; the values of v, increase non-linearly with

value of v,, and material breakdown would occur at some smaller value of P.

It is interesting to evaluate the longitudinal stresses at the mid-length of the strut; the largest
lateral deflection occurs at this section, and the greatest bending moment also occurs at this section,
therefore. The bending moment is

18.7 Initially curved pin-ended strut

In practice a strut cannot be made perfectly straight, and our analysis for the flexure of a
compressed bar would become more realistic if account could be taken of the slight deviations
from straightness of the centroidal axis of a strut.

Consider again a strut consisting of a flat strip of material. Suppose the centroidal longitudinal
axis is initially curved, the lateral displacement at any point being v, from the axis Oz, Figure 18.8.
Thrusts P are now applied at the ends of the strut and at the centroids of the end cross-sections.

Figure 18.8 Initially curved strut.

The strut then bends further from its initial unloaded position. Suppose v is the additional lateral
displacement at any section due to the application of P. If the ends of the strut are pinned there can
be no lateral forces at the ends. The bending moment at any section of the strut is

M= P(v + Vo)

If the strut is initially unstressed then the bending moment at any section is proportioned to the
change of curvature at that section. Then

M = -E14~

because the change of curvature is due only to the additional displacement v of the strut and not

Now P, is the buckling load for the perfectly straight strut. The relation for v, which is the
additional lateral displacement of the strut, shows that the effect of the end thrust P is to increase
Vy by the factor 1/((P, /P) - 1]. Obviously as P approaches P.,v tends to infinity. The additional
displacement at the mid-length of the strut is

° P, (18.30)

This relation between P and v, has the form shown in Figure 18.9(i); v. increases rapidly as P
approaches P,. Theoretically, the load P, can only be attained at an infinitely large deflection. In
practice material breakdown would occur before P, could be attained, and at a finite displacement.
We may write the relation for v, in the form

y
P,-v. =a 18.31

This gives a linear relation between (v, /P) and v,, Figure 18.9. The negative intercept on the axis
of v, is equal to (-a). If values of (v,/P) and v, are plotted in a strut test, it will be found that as the
critical condition is approached these variables are related by a straight-line equation of the type
discussed above. The slope of this straight line defines P,, the buckling load for a perfectly-straight
strut.

roots of the equation. This relation gives the value of average stress, o, at which a maximum
compressive stress 6,,,, would be attained for any value of n. If we are interested in the value of
o at which yield stress o, of a mild-steel strut is attained, we have

o = ss, +(1+a)e.]- “2, +(1+n)e.] -2,9. (18.38)

18.8 Design of pin-ended struts

A commonly used structural material is mild steel. It has been found from tests on mild-steel pin-
ended struts that failure of an initially-curved member takes place when the yield stress is first
attained in one of the extreme fibres. From a wide range of tests Robertson concluded that the
failing loads of mild-steel struts could be estimated if 7 is taken to be proportional to (Z/r) the
slenderness ratio of the strut; Robertson suggests that

n= aos +) (18.39)
r

This value of 1 gives

1 L

This represents a transition curve between yielding of the material for low slenderness ratios,
Figure 18.10, and buckling at high slenderness ratios.

Strut with uniformly distributed lateral loading 441

In the case of mild-steel struts under true axial loading buckling occurs at o, the elastic buckling
load or at o, the yield stress. If true axial loading could be achieved in practice, all struts would
fail at stresses that could be represented either by o/o, = 1, oro/o, = 1. Ina series of strut tests
it is found that the test results are usually defined by a curve on the o/o, - o/s, diagram, Figure
18.11, and not by the two straight lines o/o, = 1 and o/o, = 1. if the experimental technique is
improved to give better axial-loading conditions the curve approaches these two straight lines. Any
convenient transition curve on this diagram may be taken as a design curve for practical conditions
of axial loading.

18.9 Strut with uniformly distributed lateral loading

In the preceding sections we considered the effects of end eccentricities and initial curvatures on
the lateral bending of compressed struts; these produce lateral bending of the strut from the onset
of compression.

A similar problem arises when a compressed strut carries a lateral load. Consider a pin-ended
strut length Z and uniform flexural stiffness E/, Figure 18.12. Suppose the axial thrust on the strut
is P, and that there is a lateral load of uniform intensity w per unit length. At the ends of the strut
there are lateral shearing forces AwL.

18.10 Buckling of a strut with built-in ends

In the elastic buckling of struts, we have assumed so far that the ends of the strut are always hinged
to some foundation. When the ends are supported so that no rotations can occur, Figure 18.13,
then the relevant mode of instability for the lowest critical load involves points of contra flexure
at the quarter points. The buckling load is therefore the same as that of a pin-ended strut of half
the length. Then

When the ends of the strut are built-in, no restraining moments are induced at the ends until the

18.11 Buckling of a strut with one end fixed and the other end free

When a vertical load P is applied to the free end of a vertical cantilever, AB, at the lowest critical
load the laterally deflected form of the strut is a sinusoidal wave of length 2L. If we consider the
reflection of the buckled strut about A, Figure 18.14, then the strut of length 2L behaves as a pin-
ended strut. The buckling load is

For other combinations of end conditions we are usually led to more involved calculations. A strut

18.13 Flexural buckling of struts with other cross-sectional forms

In Section 18.2 we considered the strut to be in the form ofa flat rectangular strip. We considered
buckling to involve bending about the major axis Cx only, Figure 18.18. In the case of a flat
rectangular strip the axis Cx is clearly the weaker axis of bending. In practice, structural sections
rarely have this simple cross-sectional form, but frequently have I-sections, or angle sections, or
circular sections.

In general, if the cross-sectional form of a strut has two axes of symmetry, we can consider
flexural instability about these two axes independently. If an I-section has two axes of symmetry
in the cross-section, Figure 18.19, flexural instability occurs usually about the axis of smaller
stiffness, usually Cx. Ina rectangular strut, Figure 18.19, the weaker bending axis is parallel to the
longer sides. Circular cross-sectional forms have the property that any two mutually perpendicular
diameters are principal centroidal axes; for these sections flexural instability is equally likely about
any principal centroidal axis, Figure 18.19; when buckling occurs it is usually restricted to one
plane. In making these statement we assume the ends of the strut are hinged about both axes Cy
and Cz; this can be achieved in practice by loading through ball-ends. When the ends are not
supported in the same way about Cy and Cx, then torsional effects may become important in the
buckling behaviour.

axis of symmetry.

In the case of cross-sectional forms with only one axis of symmetry, Cy, say (Figure 18.20),
torsional effects become important if the shear centre is not coincident with the centroid. This is
true of channel sections, T-sections, and equal angle sections. Although for certain struts flexural
instability occurs about the weaker principal axis Cz, in general twisting also occurs.

In the case of cross-sectional forms with no axes of symmetry, Figure 18.21, the buckled form
always involves torsion, and the flexural buckling load has little meaning. This is true of unequal
angle struts.

18.14 Torsional buckling of a cruciform strut

We mentioned above that some struts are prone to torsional buckling effects. A cross-sectional
form in which torsional instability occurs independently of any other form of buckling is a
symmetrical cruciform section.

Figure 18.22 Cross-section of a cruciform strut.

The cruciform has four equally spaced limbs each of breadth 5 and uniform thickness ¢, Figure
18.22. Consider the section under a uniform compressive stress o, Figure 18.23(i). We consider
the possibility that the section may become unstable by twisting about the longitudinal axis Cz,
Figure 18.23(ii); the stresses 6 over the ends remain parallel to Cz during buckling.

Over any cross-section of the cruciform the stress is 6, acting parallel to Cz. Consider an
elemental area 5A of one limb at a distance x from the axis Cz, Figure 18.23(iii). If the relative
twist between two cross-sections a distance 6z apart is 60, then the force

o6A

on the elemental area is statically equivalent to a force 654 acting along the twisted form of the
strut and a small force

d8

acting in the plane of the cross-section. The inclined forces 684 on the two cross-sections are in

18.15 Modes of buckling of a cruciform strut

With a knowledge of the torsional and flexural buckling loads of a cruciform strut, we can estimate
the range of struts, we can estimate the range of struts for which buckling is likely in the two
modes.

If b is very much greater than #, and if all the limbs are similar in form, flexural buckling of a
pin-ended strut is possible about any axis through the junction of the limbs, since the flexural
stiffness is the same for all axes. For flexural instability the critical stress is

We can show the domains of flexural and torsional instability by plotting (L/b) against (6/2), Figure
18.24. For a practical material, yielding or material breakdown occurs when L/b and b/t approach
zero; the lower left-hand comer is therefore the yielding domain. Above the straight line

buckling is by flexure, whereas below this line buckling is by torsion.

18.16 Lateral buckling of a narrow beam

We have seen that the axial compression of a slender strut can lead to a condition of neutral
equilibrium, in which at a certain compressive load a flexural form of deformation becomes
possible. In the case of a cruciform strut we have shown that a form of neutral equilibrium
involving torsion is possible under certain conditions.

Problems of structural instability are not restricted entirely to compression members, although
there are many problems of this type. In the case of deep beams, for example, lateral buckling may
occur, involving torsion and bending perpendicular to the plane of the depth of the beam. In
general this problem is a complex one; however, we can determine some of the factors involved
by studying the relatively simple case of the bending of a narrow deep beam.

Figure 18.25 Lateral buckling of a narrow strip in pure bending.

A long rectangular strip has a depth A and thickness ¢, which is small compared with A, Figure
18.25. The principal centroidal axes are Cx, Cy and Cz. At the ends of the beam are vertical rollers
which prevent twisting of the beam about a longitudinal axis. The distance between the end
supports is L.

The beam is loaded with moments M applied at each end about axes parallel to Cx. Consider
the possibility that the beam may become laterally unstable at some critical value of M. If h >>
t then bending displacements in the yz plane may be neglected. Suppose in the buckled form the
principal centroidal axes at any cross-section are Cx’, Cy’ and Cz’. The lateral displacements
parallel to Cx is u, and 6 is the angle of twist about Cz at any cross-section. The moments M are
assumed to be maintained along their original lines of action; the only other forces which may be
induced at the ends are equal and opposite longitudinal torques 7. The bending moment about the
axis Cy’ is then

Find the thickness of a round steel tubular strut 3.75 cm external diameter, 2 m long, pin-

A Steel scaffolding pole acts as a strut, but the load is applied eccentrically at 7.5 cm
distance from the centre line with leverages in the same direction at top and bottom. The
pole is tubular, 5 cm external diameter and 0.6 cm thick, 3 m in length between its ends
which are not fixed in direction. If the steel has a yield stress of 300 MN/m’ and E =

19 Lateral deflections of circular plates

19.1 Introduction
In this chapter, consideration will be made of three classes of plate problem, namely
(i) small deflections of plates, where the maximum deflection does not exceed half the plate
thickness, and the deflections are mainly due to the effects of flexure;

(ii) large deflections of plates, where the maximum deflection exceeds half the plate
thickness, and membrane effects become significant; and

(iii) very thick plates, where shear deflections are significant.
Plates take many and various forms from circular plates to rectangular ones, and from plates on

ships' decks to ones of arbitrary shape with cut-outs etc; however, in this chapter, considerations
will be made mostly of the small deflections of circular plates.

Substituting equation (19.9) and (19.10) into equations (19.7) and (19.8), the bending stresses
could be put in the following form:

o, = 12M, x 2/0
and

o=12M,xz/t (19.11)

and the maximum stresses 6, and 6, will occur at the outer surfaces of the plate (ie, @z = +t/2).
Therefore

6, = 6M,/t? (19.12)
and

G, = 6M, /t? (19.13)

The plate differential equation can now be obtained by considering the equilibrium of the plate
element of Figure 19.2.

19.3 Large deflections of plates

If the maximum deflection of a plate exceeds half the plate thickness, the plate changes to a
shallow shell, and withstands much of the lateral load as a membrane, rather than as a flexural

structure.
For example, consider the membrane shown in Figure 19.6, which is subjected to uniform

lateral pressure p.

the membrane effect becomes about 65% of the bending effect. The bending and membrane
effects are about the same when w/t = 1.24. A plot of the variation of W due to bending and due
to the combined effects of bending plus membrane stresses, is shown in Figure 19.7.

19.3.1 Power series solution

This method of solution, which involves the use of data sheets, is based on a power series solution
of the fundamental equations governing the large deflection theory of circular plates.

method, it will be convenient to introduce the dimensionless ratio C, where

Figures 19.8 to 19.12. Hewitt and Tannent have also compared experiment and small deflection
theory with these curves.

19.4 Shear deflections of very thick plates
If a plate is very thick, so that membrane effects are insignificant, then it is possible that shear
deflections can become important.

For such cases, the bending effects and shear effects must be added together, as shown by
equation (19.84), which is rather similar to the method used for beams in Chapter 13,

6 = 6 +8

A flat circular plate of radius R is firmly clamped around its boundary. The plate has
stepped variation in its thickness, where the thickness inside a radius of (R/5) is so large
that its flexural stiffness may be considered to approach infinity. When the plate is

subjected to a pressure p over its entire surface, determine the maximum central
deflection and the maximum surface stress at any radius r. v = 0.3.

If the loading of Example 19.9 were replaced by a centrally applied concentrated load

W, determine expressions for the central deflection and the maximum surface stress at
any radius r.

20 Torsion of non-circular sections

20.1 Introduction

The torsional theory of circular sections (Chapter 16) cannot be applied to the torsion of non-
circular sections, as the shear stresses for non-circular sections are no longer circumferential.
Furthermore, plane cross-sections do not remain plane and undistorted on the application of torque,
and in fact, warping of the cross-section takes place.

As a result of this behaviour, the polar second moment of area of the section is no longer
applicable for static stress analysis, and it has to be replaced by a torsional constant, whose
magnitude is very often a small fraction of the magnitude of the polar second moment of area.

20.2. To determine the torsional equation

Consider a prismatic bar of uniform non-circular section, subjected to twisting action, as shown
in Figure 20.1.

Let,

x,y,z = Cartesian co-ordinates

To determine the torsional equation 493

Consider any point P in the section, which, owing to the application of 7, will rotate and warp,
as shown in Figure 20.2:

20.5 Prandtl's membrane analogy

Prandtl noticed that the equations describing the deformation of a thin weightless membrane were
similar to the torsion equation. Furthermore, he realised that as the behaviour of a thin weightless
membrane under lateral pressure was more readily understood than that of the torsion of a non-
circular section, the application of a membrane analogy to the torsion of non-circular sections
considerably simplified the stress analysis of the latter.

Prior to using the membrane analogy, it will be necessary to develop the differential equation
of a thin weightless membrane under Jateral pressure. This can be done by considering the
equilibrium of the element AA ’ BB “in Figure 20.9.

20.7 Plastic torsion

The assumption made in this section is that the material is ideally elastic-plastic, as described in

Chapter 15, so that the shear stress is everywhere equal to t,,, the yield shear stress. As the shear

stress is constant, the slope of the membrane must be constant, and for this reason, the membrane
analogy is now referred to as a sand-hill analogy.

21.1. Introduction
Thin shell theory is satisfactory when the thickness of the shell divided by its radius is less than
1/30. When the thickness: radius ratio of the shell is greater than this, errors start to occur and

thick shell theory should be used. Thick shells appear in the form of gun barrels, nuclear reactor
pressure vessels, and deep diving submersibles.

Problem 21.5 A circular cylinder of 0.2 m external diameter and of 0.1 m internal diameter
is shrunk onto another circular cylinder of external diameter 0.1 m and of bore
0.05 m, where the dimensions are nominal. If the interference fit is such that
when an internal pressure of 10 MPa is applied to the inner face of the inner
cylinder, the inner face of the inner cylinder is on the point of yielding. What
internal pressure will cause plastic penetration through half the thickness of the
inner cylinder. It may be assumed that the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio
for both cylinders is the same, but that the outer cylinder is made of a higher
grade steel which will not yield under these conditions. The yield stress of the
inner cylinder may be assumed to be 160 MPa.

22 Introduction to matrix algebra

22.1 = Introduction

Since the advent of the digital computer with its own memory, the importance of matrix algebra
has continued to grow along with the developments in computers. This is partly because matrices
allow themselves to be readily manipulated through skilful computer programming, and partly
because many physical laws lend themselves to be readily represented by matrices.

The present chapter will describe the laws of matrix algebra by a methodological approach,
rather than by rigorous mathematical theories. This is believed to be the most suitable approach
for engineers, who will use matrix algebra as a tool.

22.2. ~+Definitions

A rectangular matrix can be described as a table or array of quantities, where the quantities usually
take the form of numbers, as shown be equations (22.1) and (22.2):

ok ied Fed EE
4y, 47 3+» + Ady
43, 449 933» - + G3,
[A] = |. (22.1)
Bint any? an; vor Finn
2 -1 0O
3 4 -2
[B) = (22.2)
3 5 6
-4 -5 7

The matrix [A] of equation (22.1) is said to be of order m * n, where

Definitions $51
m = number of rows
n = number of columns

A row can be described as a horizontal line of quantities, and a column can be described as a
vertical line of quantities, so that the matrix [B] of equation (22.2) is of order 4 x 3.

The quantities contained in the third row of [B] are -3, 5 and 6, and the quantities contained
in the second column of [B] are - 1, 4, 5 and -5.

A square matrix has the same number of rows as columns, as shown by equation (22.3), which
is said to be of order 7:

41, Aq 3 1,
4, 42 43 - ay,
43, 43. 433 - 43,
[A] = (22.3)
an} 4,2 a3 se Gap,

A column matrix contains a single column of quantities, as shown by equation (22.4), where it can
be seen that the matrix is represented by braces:

{A} = ¢- (22.4)

A row matrix contains a single row of quantities, as shown by equation (22.5), where it can be seen
that the matrix is represented by the special brackets:

[A] = (ay, 412 43+ + - a, (22.5)

The transpose of a matrix is obtained by exchanging its columns with its rows, as shown by
equation (22.6):

552 Introduction to matrix algebra

a = [4-3] = Bl

(22.6)

In equation (22.6), the first row of [A], when transposed, becomes the first column of [B]; the
second row of [A] becomes the second column of [B] and the third row of [A] becomes the third
column of [B}, respectively.

22.3 Matrix addition and subtraction

Matrices can be added together in the manner shown below. If

1 0
[Al = 14 -3
-5 6
and
2 9
[B] = |-7 8
-] -2
(1+2) (0+9)
[A] + [B] = | (4-7) (-3+8) (22.7)
(-5-1) (6-2)
3 9
-3 5

-6 4

Some special types of square matrix

Similarly, matrices can be subtracted in the manner shown below:

(1 - 2) (0 - 9)
[A] - [B} = (4 +7) (-3 - 8)

(-5 + 1) (6 + 2)

-1 -9
= |ll -11
-4 8

Thus, in general, for two m x n matrices:

(a,, + b)(a12 + b) ...(a,, + b,)
(a, + by (ang + by) . (a, + bn)
[4] + [3] -

(a1 + bmi) (na + bn2) a (ann + ban)

and

554 Introduction to matrix algebra

22.4 Matrix multiplication

Matrices can be multiplied together, by multiplying the rows of the premultiplier into the columns
of the postmultiplier, as shown by equations (22.11) and (22.12).

If
1 0
[A] = | 4-3
-5 6
and
7 2 -2
[B] =
-1 3 -4

[A] x [B] = [C]

(1x 7+ Ox (-1)) (1x2 + 0x 3)(1x (-2)+ 0x (-4))
(4x 7+ (-3)x (-1))(4x 2+ (-3)x 3)(4 (-2)+ (-3)x (-4)) (22.11)
(-5x 7+ 6x (-1))(-5x 2+ 6x 3)(-5x (-2)+ 6x (-4))

(7+0) (2+0) (-2+0)

(~35-6) (-10+18) (10-24)

7 2 -2
[Cc] = | 31 -1 4 (22.12)
-41 8 -14

i.e. to obtain an element of the matrix [C], namely C;,, the ith row of the premultiplier [A] must

be premultiplied into the jth column of the postmultiplier [B] to give

i
Cc, = > ax x b,

k1

Some special types of square matrix 555

where
P= the number of columns of the premultiplier and also, the number of rows of the
postmultiplier.
NB The premultiplying matrix [A] must have the same number of columns as the rows in the

postmultiplying matrix [B].

In other words, if [A] is of order (m < P) and [B] is of order (P x n), then the product [C] is of
order (m x n).

22.5 Some special types of square matrix

A diagonal matrix is a square matrix which contains all its non-zero elements in a diagonal from
the top left corner of the matrix to its bottom right corner, as shown by equation (22.13). This
diagonal is usually called the main or leading diagonal.

a, 0 0 0
0 ay 0
[A] = m9 8 (22.13)
0
0
0 0 0 a

A special case of diagonal matrix is where all the non-zero elements are equal to unity, as shown
by equation (22.14). This matrix is called a unit matrix, as it is the matrix equivalent of unity.

10 0 0
01 0 0

{1} = | 0 0 1 (22.14)
0
0 0 0 1

A symmetrical matrix is shown in equation (22.15), where it can be seen that the matrix is
symmetrical about its leading diagonal:

i.e. for a symmetrical matrix, all

22.6 Determinants

The determinant of the 2x2 matrix of equation (22.16) can be evaluated, as follows:

4 2
[A] = (22.16)
-1 6
Determinant of [A] = 4x6-2x(-1) = 24+2 = 26
so that, in general, the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, namely det[A], is given by:
det [A] = ay, X a - a * ay, (22.17)
where
a,, a
lal = wo (22.18)
4, ay

Similarly, the determinant of the 3x3 matrix of equation (22.19) can be evaluated, as shown by
equation (22.20):

For example, the determinant of equation (22.21) can be evaluated, as follows:

or
det |A| = 279

For a determinant of large order, this method of evaluation is unsatisfactory, and readers are
advised to consult Ross, C T F, Advanced Applied Finite Element Methods (Horwood 1998), or
Collar, A R, and Simpson, A, Matrices and Engineering Dynamics (Ellis Horwood, 1987) which
give more suitable methods for expanding larger order determinants.

22.7 Cofactor and adjoint matrices

The cofactor of a third order matrix is obtained by removing the appropriate columns and rows of
the cofactor, and evaluating the resulting determinants, as shown below.

22.8 Inverse of a matrix [A]"’

The inverse or reciprocal matrix is required in matrix algebra, as it is the matrix equivalent of a
scalar reciprocal, and it is used for division.
The inverse of the matrix [A] is given by equation (22.24):

and the determinant is given by:

so that

Introduction to matrix algebra

(22.26)

In general, inverting large matrices through the use of equation (22.24) is unsatisfactory, and for
large matrices, the reader is advised to refer to Ross, C T F, Advanced Applied Finite Element
Methods (Horwood 1998), where a computer program is presented for solving nth order matrices

on a microcomputer.

The inverse of a unit matrix is another unit matrix of the same order, and the inverse of a

diagonal matrix is obtained by finding the reciprocals of its leading diagonal.

The inverse of an orthogonal matrix is equal to its transpose. A typical orthogonal matrix is

shown in equation (22.27):

where
c = cosa
Ss = sina

The cofactors of [A] are:

i.e. for an orthogonal matrix

[AJ* = [A]}* (22.28)

22.9 Solution of simultaneous equations

The inverse of a matrix can be used for solving the set of linear simultaneous equations shown in
equation (22.29). If,

[A] {x} = {e} (22.29)

where [A] and {c} are known and {x} is a vector of unknowns, then {x} can be obtained from
equation (22.30), where [A] ' has been pre-multiplied on both sides of this equation:

fe} = [A]? {e} (22.30)
Another method of solving simultaneous equations, which is usually superior to inverting the
matrix, is by triangulation. For this case, the elements of the matrix below the leading diagonal

are eliminated, so that the last unknown can readily be determined, and the remaining unknowns
obtained by back-substitution.

23 Matrix methods of structural analysis

23.1 ~=Introduction

This chapter describes and applies the matrix displacement method to various problems in
structural analysis. The matrix displacement method first appeared in the aircraft industry in the
1940s’, where it was used to improve the strength-to-weight ratio of aircraft structures.

In today's terms, the structures that were analysed then were relatively simple, but despite this,
teams of operators of mechanical, and later electromechanical, calculators were required to
implement it. Even in the 1950s, the inversion of a matrix of modest size, often took a few weeks
to determine. Nevertheless, engineers realised the importance of the method, and it led to the
invention of the finite element method in 1956°, which is based on the matrix displacement
method. Today, of course, with the progress made in digital computers, the matrix displacement
method, together with the finite element method, is one of the most important forms of analysis
in engineering science.

The method is based on the elastic theory, where it can be assumed that most structures behave
like complex elastic springs, the load—displacement relationship of which is linear. Obviously, the
analysis of such complex springs is extremely difficult, but if the complex spring is subdivided into
a number of simpler springs, which can readily be analysed, then by considering equilibrium and
compatibility at the boundaries, or nodes, of these simpler elastic springs, the entire structure can
be represented by a large number of simultaneous equations. Solution of the simultaneous
equations results in the displacements at these nodes, whence the stresses in each individual spring
element can be determined through Hookean elasticity.

In this chapter, the method will first be applied to pin-jointed trusses, and then to continuous
beams and rigid-jointed plane frames.

23.2 Elemental stiffness matrix for a rod

A pin-jointed truss can be assumed to be a structure composed of line elements, called rods, which
possess only axial stiffness. The joints connecting the rods together are assumed to be tn the form
of smooth, frictionless hinges. Thus these rod elements in fact behave like simple elastic springs,
as described in Chapter 1.

Consider now the rod element of Figure 23.1, which is described by two nodes at its ends,
namely, node 1 and node 2.

23.3 System stiffness matrix [K]

A structure such as pin-jointed truss consists of several rod elements; so to demonstrate how to
form the system or structural stiffness matrix, consider the structure of Figure 23.2, which is
composed of two in-line rod elements.

Consider element 1-2. Then from equation (23.5), the stiffness matrix for the rod element 1—2 is

AAT -]u

Iky | 1
; (23.6)

The element is described as 1-2, which means it points from node | to node 2, so that its start node
is 1 and its finish node is 2. The displacements u, and uw, are not part of the stiffness matrix, but
are used to describe the coefficients of stiffness that correspond to those displacements.

Consider element 2-3. Substituting the values 4,, E, and J, into equation (23.5), the elemental
stiffness matrix for element 2-3 is given by

1 -1]y,

[kes] =

A,E,
L

Here again, the displacements u, and wu, are not part of the stiffness matrix, but are used to describe
the components of stiffness corresponding to these displacements.

The system stiffness matrix [K] is obtained by superimposing the coefficients of stiffness of
the elemental stiffness matrices of equations (23.6) and (23.7), into a system stiffness matrix of
pigeon holes, as shown by equation (23.8):

uy uy, uz

K) = 23.8
[Kk] -AE,/h AE /h+AEy/l - AEy/h| uy (23.8)

0 ~ AE, | ly 4,Ey th] y,

It can be seen from equation (23.8), that the components of stiffness are added together with
reference to the displacements u,, u, andu,. This process, effectively mathematically joms together
the two springs at their common node, namely node 2.

System stiffness matrix {K] 569

Let

{q} = Po (23.9)

= avector of known externally applied loads at the nodes, 1, 2 and 3, respectively

fu = ep (23.10)

a vector of unknown nodal displacements, due to {gq}, at nodes 1, 2 and 3
respectively

Now for the entire structure,
force = stiffness x displacement, or
{q} = [K] {u} (23.11)
where [K] is the system or structural stiffness matrix.
Solution of equation (23.11) cannot be carried out, as [K] is singular, i.e. the structure is

floating in space and has not been constrained. To constrain the structure of Figure 23.2, let us
assume that it is firmly fixed at (say) node 3, so thatu, = 0.

Equation (23.11) can now be partitioned with respect to the free displacements, namely u, and
u,, and the constrained displacement, namely u,, as shown by equation (23.12):

23.5 Plane rod element in global co-ordinates

For this case, there are four degrees of freedom per element, namely u,°, v,°, u,° and v,°. Thus,
the elemental stiffness matrix for a rod in local co-ordinates must be written as a 4 x 4 matrix, as
shown by equation (23.28):

7
1 o -1 o|%
[k]- oo 0 eye (23.28)
r |-1 0 1 Oly
0 0 0 Oy

The reason why the coefficients of the stiffness matrix under v, and v, are zero, is that the rod only
possesses axial stiffness in the local x-direction, as shown in Figure 23.1.

Plane rod element in global co-ordinates 575

For the inclined rod of Figure 23.4, although the rod only possesses stiffness in the x-direction,
it has components of stiffness in the global x°- and y°-directions.

The elemental stiffness matrix for a rod in global co-ordinates is obtained, as follows. From
equation (23.4):

Pi} = (kl 4} (23.29)
but
} P} = [DC] {P,°} (23.30)
and

fj} = [DC] {u,”} (23.31)

Substituting equations (23.30) and (23.31) into equation (23.29), the following is obtained:

[DC] {P,°} = {k] [DC] {u,°} (23.32)

Premultiplying both sides by [DC] "',

{P°\ = [DC]* [k] [DC] {u,°}

but from equation (22.28),

3m ——~}+-— 2m

Now the matrix displacement method is based on applying the loads at the nodes, but for the above
beam, the loading on each element is between the nodes. It will therefore be necessary to adopt
the following process, which is based on the principle of superposition:

1.

Fix the beam at its nodes and determine the end fixing forces, as shown in the following
figure at (a) and (b) and as calculated below.

The beam in condition (1) is not in equilibrium at node 2, hence, it will be necessary to
subject the beam to the negative resultants of the end fixing forces at node 2 to achieve
equilibrium, as shown in the figure at (c). It should be noted that, as the beam is firmly
fixed at nodes 1 and 3, any load or couple applied to these ends will in fact be absorbed
by these walls.

Using the matrix displacement method, determine the nodal displacements due to the
loads of the figure at (c) and, hence, the resulting bending moments.

To obtain the final values of nodal bending moments, the bending moments of condition
(1) must be superimposed with those of condition (3).

problem in a manner similar to that described in the solution of Problem 23.5.

There are four degrees of freedom for this structure, namely, u,°, 9,, u,° and 0,, hence {q,} will
be of order 4 x 1.

To determine {q,}, it will be necessary to fix the structure at its nodes, and calculate the end
fixing forces, as shown and calculated below.

24 The finite element method

24.1 = Introduction

In this chapter the finite element method proper’? will be described with the aid of worked
examples.

The finite element method is based on the matrix displacement method described in Chapter
23, but its description is separated from that chapter because it can be used for analysing much
more complex structures, such as those varying from the legs of an integrated circuit to the legs
of an offshore drilling rig, or from a gravity dam to a doubly curved shell roof. Additionally, the
method can be used for problems in structural dynamics, fluid flow, heat transfer, acoustics,
magnetostatics, electrostatics, medicine, weather forecasting, etc.

The method is based on representing a complex shape by a series of simpler shapes, as shown
in Figure 24.1, where the simpler shapes are called finite elements.

Finite elements

Nodes

Figure 24.1 Complex shape, represented by finite elements.

Using the energy methods described in Chapter 17, the stiffness and other properties of the
finite element can be obtained, and then by considering equilibrium and compatibility along the
inter-element boundaries, the stiffness and other properties of the entire domain can be obtained.

628 The finite element method

This process leads to a large number of simultaneous equations, which can readily be solved
ona high-speed digital computer. It must be emphasised, however, that the finite element method
is virtually useless without the aid of a computer, and this is the reason why the finite element
method has been developed alongside the advances made with digital computers. Today, it is
possible to solve massive problems on most computers, including microcomputers, laptop and
notepad computers; and in the near future, it will be possible to use the finite element method with
the aid of hand-held computers.

Finite elements appear in many forms, from triangles and quadrilaterals for two-dimensional
domains to tetrahedrons and bricks for three-dimensional domains, where, in general, the finite
element is used as a ‘space’ filler.

Each finite element is described by nodes, and the nodes are also used to describe the domain,
as shown in Figure 24.1, where corner nodes have been used.

If, however, mid-side nodes are used in addition to commer nodes, it is possible to develop
curved finite elements, as shown in Figure 24.2, where it is also shown how ring nodes can be used
for axisymmetric structures, such as conical shells.

Stiffness matrices for some typical finite elements 629

The finite element was invented in 1956 by Turner et ai. where the important three node in-
plane triangular finite element was first presented.
The derivation of the stiffness matrix for this element will now be described.

24.2 Stiffness matrices for some typical finite elements

The in-plane triangular element of Turner et al. is shown in Figure 24.3. From this figure, it can
be seen that the element has six degrees of freedom, namely, u,°, u,°, u,°, v,°, v,° and v,°, and
because of this, the assumptions for the displacement polynomial distributions u° and v° will
involve six arbitrary constants. It is evident that with six degrees of freedom, a total of six
simultaneous equations will be obtained for the element, so that expressions for the six arbitrary
constants can be defined in terms of the nodal displacements, or boundary values.

Convenient displacement equations are

and

where a, to a, are the six arbitrary constants, and u° and v° are the displacement equations.
Suitable boundary conditions, or boundary values, at node 1 are:

° fo)

Similarly, at node 2,

and v,° = O, +a5x,° + ay,° (24.6)

Likewise, at node 3,

As there are three degrees of freedom, namely u,, u, and u,, it will be convenient to assume a
polynomial involving three arbitrary constants, as shown by equation (24.37):

ueo= a, + Ox + a,x’ (24.37)
To obtain the three simultaneous equations, it will be necessary to assume the following three

Atx =0O,u =4,

Atx =I/2,u = u, (24.38)

25 Structural vibrations

25.1. ~=—‘Introduction

In this chapter, we will commence with discussing the free vibrations of a beam, which will be
analysed by traditional methods. This fundamental approach will then be extended to forced
vibrations and to damped oscillations, all on beams and by traditional methods.

The main snag with using traditional methods for vibration analysis, however, is that it is
extremely difficult to analyse complex structures by this approach. For this reason, the finite
element method discussed in the previous chapters will be extended to free vibration analysis, and
applications will then be made to a number of simple structures.

Vibrations of structures usually occur due to pulsating or oscillating forces, such as those due
to gusts of wind or from the motion of machinery, vehicles etc. If the pulsating load is oscillating
at the same natural frequency of the structure, the structure can vibrate dangerously (i.e. resonate).
If these vibrations continue for any length of time, the structure can suffer permanent damage.

25.2 Free vibrations of a mass on a beam
We can simplify the treatment of the free vibrations of a beam by considering its mass to be

concentrated at the mid-length. Consider, for example, a uniform simply-supported beam of length
L and flexural stiffness E/, Figure 25.1.

Figure 25.1 Vibrations of a concentrated mass on a beam.

Suppose the beam itself is mass-less, and that a concentrated mass M is held at the mid-span. If
we ignore for the moment the effect of the gravitational field, the beam is undeflected when the

644 Structural vibrations

mass is at rest. Now consider the motion of the mass when the beam is deflected laterally to some
position and then released. Suppose, v, is the lateral deflection of the beam at the mid-span at a
time #; as the bear is mass-less the force P on the beam at the mid-span is

48 Ely,
-—
If k = 48 EW/L’, then
P =k

e

The mass-less beam behaves then as a simple elastic spring cf stiffness k. In the deflected position
there is an equal and opposite reaction P on the mass. The equation of vertical motion of the mass
is

Thus

The general solution of this differential equation is
v, = Acos + y+ Bsin 4,
M M

where A and B are arbitrary constants; this may also be written in the form

Vv. = c sa E,.|
\4

where C and ¢ are also arbitrary constants. Obviously C is the amplitude of a simple-harmonic
motion of the beam (Figure 25.2); v, first assumes its peak value when

and again attains this value when

M 2

This period T of one complete oscillation is then

M

The number of complete oscillations occurring in unit time is the frequency of vibrations; this is
denoted by n, and is given by

n= =—|— (25.2)

The behaviour of the system is therefore directly analogous to that of a simple mass—spring system.
On substituting for the value of k we have

n=—=— (25.3)

Consider a uniform beam of length L, flexural stiffness £7, and mass m per unit length (Figure
25.3); suppose the beam is simply-supported at each end, and is vibrating freely in the yz-plane,
the displacement at any point parallel to the y-axis being v. We assume first that the beam vibrates
in a sinusoidal form

. Zz.
vo= a sin —~ sin2ant (25.4)

where a is the lateral displacement, or amplitude, at the mid-length, and 7 is the frequency of
oscillation. The kinetic energy of an elemental length 6z of the beam is

As in the case of the beam with a concentrated mass at the mid-length, we have ignored
gravitation effects; when the weight of the beam causes initial deflections of the beam, oscillations
take place about this deflected condition; otherwise the effects of gravity may be ignored.

25.5 Damped free oscillations of a beam

The free oscillations of practical systems are inhibited by damping forces. One of the commonest
forms of damping is known as velocity, or viscous, damping; the damping force on a particle or
mass is proportional to its velocity.

Figure 25.6 Effect of damping on free vibrations.

Suppose in the beam problem discussed in Section 25.2 we have as the damping force p(dv/d?).

25.7 Vibrations of a beam with end thrust

In general, when a beam carries end thrust the period of free undamped vibrations is greater than
when the beam carries no end thrust. Consider the uniform beam shown in Figure 25.8; suppose

given by

v = asin = sin 2nnt (25.25)

Equation (25.117) shows the mass matrix for the self-mass of an element of a nigid-jointed
