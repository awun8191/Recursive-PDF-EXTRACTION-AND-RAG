What is ICT?

ICT means Information and Communication Technology. ICT can be defined as the
technologies people use to share, distribute, and gather information and to communicate
through computers and computer networks.

It is an omnibus term that combines computer and telecommunication technology. It is
the study or business of developing and using technology to process information and aid
communications.

Components of ICT

i. Computers
ii. Telecommunication technologies

Computer

Computer is a programmable machine. The two principal characteristics of a computer
are: it responds to a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner and it can
execute a prerecorded list of instructions (a program).

Basically, according to Capron (2000), a computer is a machine that can be programmed
to accept data (input) and store it away (secondary storage device) for safekeeping or
later for reuse.

It can be divided into three parts: (1) hardware (2) software and (3) human ware. Without
any of these, the computer cannot perform its many operations. The equipment itself and
the accessories constitute the hardware — this is the physical part of the computer. The
software is the set of instructions that enable a computer performs all kinds of functions.
Human beings that manipulate both the hardware and software to serve the various
purposes the computer do constitute the human ware.

Components of a Computer

i. Input devices — translate data/ information which are recognized by human
beings into a form that can be processed by a computer. Examples: mouse,

keyboard, scanner such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Bar Code
Readers (BCR) — the zebra stripped marks used as serial numbers of items can be
read by a computer through the BCR, Optical Mark Recognition (OMR)- when
pencil marks are converted into digital format by the scanner.

Central Processing Unit — the heart of the computer consisting of the RAM,
Arithmetic /Logic Unit (ALU) and the Control Unit. The ALU processes all
arithmetic operation and logical comparison of data held in computer’s immediate
access store. The Control Unit controls the ALU, immediate memory, input and
output devices through a master program called the Operating System (OS).

Output devices — translate processed data into a form that human beings can
interpret. Examples are: Visual Display Unit (VDU) also known as screen or
monitor, printers, plotter, loudspeakers, etc.

Secondary storage — also called external or ancillary stores. The Random Access
Memory (RAM) is the primary storage of the computer. The size of the RAM is
usually small, thus the need for secondary storage such as magnetic tapes,
magnetic disks e.g. the Digital Video/Versatile Disk (DVD), CD- ROM (Compact
Disk Read Only Memory) and floppy disk (diskette). Today, there are various
secondary storage devices with varying storage capacities and degree of
portability, e.g. Flash disk, external memory disk, memory cards and so on.

Some benefits of ICT in Library.

Librarians use ICTs to perform functions like:

1.

Vi.

Organization of information for use (cataloguing and classification, serials
management).

Acquisition and collection management.
Circulation management (user registration, loans).

Resource sharing / consortium building e.g Online Computer Library Catalog
(OCLC).

Indexing and abstracting in order to improve information services to library users.

Computer — processed information enhances certain library services and functions
such as Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI).
