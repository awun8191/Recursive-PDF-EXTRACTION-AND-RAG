Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Libraries 2
= Communication and Internet Resources
= Database Resources
Telecommunication System

This is the second arm of the ICT. Telecommunications constitute an important
component of ICT because it is through them information can be transmitted over long
distances. Basically, telecommunication system has to do with the electronic
transmission of data of all kinds (text, graphics, sounds and video) over a variety of
different communication channels such as public telephone lines, private cables,
microwave or the satellite.

Modulator/ Demodulator (Modem): this is a device commonly used in national and
international networks. It allows a computer to communicate with another over a standard
telephone line by converting the digital data from a computer into analogue signals and
vice versa. It is actually a piece of hardware that is plugged into the computer and
telephone. Most computers usually have a modem. These days, telephone line or SIM
cards are built into the modem to enable computer-telephone-computer communication
over a network.

Note: modem modulates digital signals to analogue while it demodulates analogue to
digital.

Internet

The Internet is a collection of vast information sources of interlinked computer networks.
A network is a computer system that uses communication equipment to connect two or
more computers and their resources. The Internet is the largest network. The Internet
allows millions of computers around the world to communicate with each other.

The World Wide Web (www or 3W) usually called the Web is the most important
facility on the Internet. It consists of a series of various computers that are linked to the
Internet through the use of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Websites can be created
on the Internet and they can be accessed through a Browser (e.g. Internet Explorer,
Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc.). Each website has its Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) otherwise known as the website address. With a computer and an ISP
(Internet Service Provider), the Internet can be accessed and with a browser explored.

Internet Search Engines and Search Strategies

The vast and diverse landscape of the Internet can be explored effectively through the use
of Internet search tools. Through the search tools information on the Internet can be
found. There are three categories of search tools, namely:

i. Search engines
ii. Directory search.
iii. Meta engine

Search engines — they are specialized programmes that assist users to locate information
on the web. They enable a user to find the contents of millions of web pages
simultaneously once the appropriate search terms or key words are used. The results of a
search on the search engine called ‘Hits’? could be up to several millions since it
retrieves all the documents that match the subject term or keywords typed into the space
(Search box) provided on the search engine. Many search engines use Basic search and
Advanced search tools. Popular search engines include; Google, Infoseek, Lycos,
Ask.com, Yahoo, Bing, Answers.com, etc.

Directory search — also known as index search, is the search programme that produces
a directory or list of categories of topics such as finance, health, news, universities. It
assists in browsing many sites on a topic. The directories are usually arranged by subject
groups. Itprovidesalistofresult(note).

Meta engines- they are programmes that automatically submit your search request to
several search engines simultaneously. They receive the results, eliminate duplicates,
orders the list and provide the edited list to you. e.g. Dogpile, Metacrawler, Yippy,
Pandia, Zuula (for searching web, blogs, images, News from Google).

Search Strategies
The following steps should be taken while using an Internet search engine:

i. Prepare — analyze your query, identify key concepts (key words) and any
otheruseful information e.g. “Labour laws in Nigeria”. How would you analyze
this into its concepts for effective search? The keywords here are: Labour (labor);
Laws (regulations, rules, legal, statutes, ...); Nigeria

li. Select Boolean operators to connect search terms.

ili. Identify phrases e.g. “to err is human’. This kind of phrase cannot be broken into
keywords

iv. Organize complex search statements using parenthesis.
v. | Refine your search in case you are not satisfied with the result of the first try.
vi. Meta search to safe time.

Evaluating Your Search Results

Not every result of search is authentic — therefore, always check for the following:

i. Authority — who writes the article or owns the
material?I.ewhoaredpeoplersponsibleforthatwork.
ii. Currency — when last was the page updated?
ili. Accuracy — is the information reliable and error —free?
iv. Objectivity — is it free of bias and sentiments?
v. | Coverage — what is the scope of the resources?

Web Addresses

This is another interesting aspect of the ICT that have impacted greatly on scholarship.
The web address is known as the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which is a specific
character string that constitutes a reference to a resource on the World Wide Web. It is
divided into four (4) major parts:

(1)Type of connection (2) domain name of computer (3) directory (4) file name

Example: http://www.abuad.edu.ng/registry/admissionlist2013.html

In the above example, “http://’ is the type of connection, “www.abuad.edu.ng” is the
domain name, “registry” is the folder, and “admissionlist2013.html” is the file name.

Application of ICT in Library
i. CD-ROM technology

This perform the same function as external search service only that it is less complicated
because it does not require communication links. The databases are stored in a digital
optical medium called Compact Disc Read Only Memory (CD-ROM). They have a high
storage capacity of typical CD-ROM can store the equivalent of 250,000 pages of text.

The CD-ROM can be used to store a variety of things including music, directories, books,
periodicals, computer applications, etc.

ii. OPAC- Online Public Access Catalogue

This is an example of locally stored databases. Many libraries now have their catalogues
online as OPAC through which users within and outside an institution can access the
library catalogue without entering the library.

Other Applications of ICT in Library
The other applications of ICT in library apart from the two discussed above are:

= E-Mails

= Mailing lists e.g.listserves

= Blogging

= Social media (Tweeter, Facebook , YouTube, ResearchGate, MyScience Work)

» E-library databases e.g.: JSTOR, HINARI, MEDLINE, LEXIS NEXIS

=" Google scholar, OpenCourseWare resources, E-learning

= Reference management software such as Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote, Connotea,
etc

« Library management software, also called Integrated Library Systems (ILS) e.g.:
GLAS, ALICE for Windows, INMAGIC DB TEXTWORK, TINLIB, KOHA, etc.

Digital Libraries

Digital library or an electronic library is a library in which collections are stored
in electronic mediaformats (as opposed to print, microform, or other media) and
accessible via computers. The electronic content may be stored locally, or accessed
remotely via computer network. It is a large collection of information sources in various
media—coupled with the advantages of digital technologies. In fact, the resources of a
digital library or e-library are largely databases in various media and formats. These may
include: journal databases, e-books, institutional repositories, pictures, and lots of other
materials.Some databases in academic and professional arenas are:

AGRICOLA (agriculture & related sciences); NTIS (engineering, science & social
sciences);

MEDLINE; EBSCO-HOST; Science Direct; CINAHL (Cumulative Index for Nursing
and Allied Health); Communication & Mass Media Complete; Directory of Open Access

Journals; DynaMed; JSTOR; LexisNexis Academic; Library and Information Science
Abstracts (LISA).
