Introduction

The word “Library” is derived from the Latin word “Liber”, meaning “book”. The
Library is primarily set up to acquire, organize, store and make accessible to users within
the quickest possible time all forms of information and information materials which they
require.

Systematic acquisition, organization and dissemination of books not mere label,
distinguish a library from either a reading room or a bookshop. The specific purpose of
any library is to acquire, organize, preserve, and make recorded human knowledge
available and accessible.

Definition of a Library

A Library is concerned with collection, processing, storage and dissemination of recorded
information for the purpose of reading, study and consultation.

Brief History of Library

The need for human being to transmit their thoughts and vision in an external medium to
others and preservation of culture which established libraries brought about WRITING.
Writing could be said to have started around 7000 years ago.

Various forms of writing materials: Cuneiform (clay tablets), papyrus, parchment or
vellum, stone, animal bones, tortoise shell, paper, and now digital equipment are forms of
writing materials.

History of library is categorized into three (3) eras, namely:

1. Ancient Era
2. Medieval Era
3. Modern Era

Ancient Era

Libraries have been in existence as far back as 6000 years. The beginning can be traced
to the Sumerians (an ancient Mesopotamian civilization). The Sumerians developed
cuneiform to record the activities of government, temple and business. The documents
were used by the community leaders who were the only literate members of the society. It
was discovered that the Babylonians waged war against the Sumerians, the Assyrians
later conquered the Babylonians, and still the trend continued thus influencing the spread
of libraries among nations. Libraries were later found in Egypt. Among the great
noticeable libraries then are Aristotle Library in Greece, Ulpian Library in Rome, and
Alexandria Library in Egypt.

Medieval Era (5th -— 15th Century)

Private libraries dominated the library scene. Christianity played a dominant role during
this era; hence libraries were usually in monasteries and cathedrals. To keep knowledge
of the scriptures alive, the priests, monks and bishops established libraries to keep and
copy existing documents. Also, Muslims were not left behind during the era.

Modern Era (Mid 14th - Part of 16th Century)

During this era, things were becoming more civilized. More private libraries and other
libraries were springing up. These two notable inventions in Europe also brought changes
to the medium and forms of writing:

1. Paper was invented in AD105 by Tsai Lun (a Chinese)
2. Printing machine was invented by Johannes Gutenberg (a German Printer)

It was in this era that books were first arranged on the shelves at Vatican Library in
Rome.

Library and Education

Education is a process of learning; and the art of acquiring knowledge and skills. It also
involves the process of teaching, training and learning especially in schools or colleges to
improve knowledge and develop skills. It starts from the cradle to the grave.

Types of Education
1. Formal, e.g. Schools with organized curriculum
2. Non-formal, e.g. Vocational training

3. Informal, e.g. Indigenous education

Education was pioneered in Nigeria by the Missionaries. During this period, the
missionaries are the group that dominated the educational system because they are the
first set of people to be literate. The period between 1940 and 1970 witnessed rapid
educational development at all levels where mass education programmes were embarked
upon. More primary, secondary and tertiary institutions with libraries were established.
