Complex lons and kK,

The formation of complex ions can be treated as a Lewis
acid-base reaction:

Agy + 2NH, =  Ag(NH,).*
acid base complex ion

Complex lons and kK,

The formation of complex ions can be treated as a Lewis
acid-base reaction:

Agy + 2NH, =  Ag(NH,).*
acid base complex ion

Recall the definitions of a Lewis acid and base:
Acid is an electron acceptor
Base is an electron donor

Complex lons and kK,

The formation of complex ions can be treated as a Lewis
acid-base reaction:

Agy + 2NH, =  Ag(NH,).*
acid base complex ion

Recall the definitions of a Lewis acid and base:
Acid is an electron acceptor
Base is an electron donor

Transition metal ions are good Lewis acids, since they are
short of the p° electron configuration.

Bronsted bases are also good Lewis bases. The unshared
electrons will both attract an H* and are donateable.

Complex lons and kK,

The formation of complex ions can be treated as a Lewis
acid-base reaction:

Agy + 2NH, =  Ag(NH,).*
acid base complex ion

Recall the definitions of a Lewis acid and base:
Acid is an electron acceptor
Base is an electron donor

Thus, the usual arrangement is:
The metal ion to acts as a Lewis acid and
The other molecule/ion in the reaction acts as a Lewis base.

Complex lons and kK,

The formation of complex ions can be treated as a Lewis
acid-base reaction:

Agy + 2NH, =  Ag(NH,).*
acid base complex ion
Definitions:

The metal ion in the complex ion is called the “central”
atom/ion.

The other component in the complex (NH, in the above) is
called the “ligand”.

Complex lons and kK,

The formation of complex ions can be treated as a Lewis
acid-base reaction:

Agy + 2NH, =  Ag(NH,).*
acid base complex ion
Definitions:

The bond between the ligand and the central atom is
called a “coordinate covalent” (or “dative”) bond.

Complex lons and kK,

The formation of complex ions can be treated as a Lewis
acid-base reaction:

Agy + 2NH, =  Ag(NH,).*
acid base complex ion
Definitions:

The bond between the ligand and the central atom is
called a “coordinate covalent” (or “dative”) bond.

Notice that in the above example, NH, “contributes” both of
Its electrons to the bond. This is sometimes indicated with an
arrow SO:

[H,N-Ag<NH.,]* (thus “dative”)

Complex lons and kK,

These reactions can be in equilibrium, and therefore have Ks
associated with them.

For the formation of the complex ion, this is called a
“formation” equilibrium constant, with the symbol K,.

Ag’ +  2NH, =~ Ag(NH.),* K,=1.6 x 10’

Complex lons and kK,
These reactions can be in equilibrium, and therefore have Ks
associated with them.

For the formation of the complex ion, this is called a
“formation” equilibrium constant, with the symbol K,.

Agi +  2NH, =~ Ag(NH.),* K,=1.6 x 10’

since this is an equilibrium, tt can equally be written in the
reverse.

The K for this is called a dissociation constant, K,.

Ag(NH,)* = Ag* +  2NH, K,=6.3~x 10°

Complex lons and kK,
In the slide show on General Equilibrium examples were
given using both of these reactions.
Agé +  2NH, =  Ag(NH,).* K,=1.6 x 10’
Ag(NH.).* = Ag* +  2NH, K,=6.3 x 10°

For this slide show the Kk, will be usea”.

Agé +  2NH, =  Ag(NH,).* K,=1.6 x 10’
Ag(NH.).* = Ag* +  2NH, K,=6.3 x 10°

are:
‘[Ag(NHL), | | Ag* |[NH,]

| Ag* |[NH,]} [Ae(NH,), ia

Notice that these are inverses of each other. To obtain the kK,
from the K; and visa-versa use: K;K, = 1

Complex lons and kK,
