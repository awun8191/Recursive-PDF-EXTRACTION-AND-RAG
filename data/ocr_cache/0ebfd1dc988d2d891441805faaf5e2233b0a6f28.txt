fasttaction: Head the following passage and answer the questions am i.

“Love™ is aocword that fs on the lips of many people in our world today ‘ut,
unfortunately, matin their leas, Tt ig ihe theme of the lysics of most hip-hop, reggae, raga,
pop-fink, blues, secular, spiritual, local, and even inlertational music, lo mention but a few.
It fs the tugjec or sole preeeeupertion of moetereabve works aod erica! essays of anthors dikes
pocts, novelists, and playwrights. Seulptors und other artists also display love with their
crafts, But dred, most people have Hele ot na correct or complote idea of what the word
achuuliy means. [tis thus worthwhile fo consider most people's coscepts of love,

Consider a siretingéy handsome rich youre mun who met e breath-taking beastitul
prom for the first time. The man pol fascinated by her beauty, wealth and ivtellece. The
lady too was sirepy aff fer fee by the man’s handsomeness, achievements career-wise, his
wealth and genoral charivea. That same day, when they had hardly known cach other, lbey
proteased their love for cach other. In the next forty hours, they ned chatted on the telephone
several rodtites muuming inte several hours on several occasions. On the fourth day, they
ended up in bed for a session rounds of raspy pampy. But they did not know that the lave
they felt for each other was the type they celled infatuation based on sheer physical attrchion

amd sex appeal,

Love could also be platonic. This usually does not begin as love at first sight The
people concemed are brought together by circumstances of work ot any other common
interest in noemal living, The longer they stay together, the more they discover more things
that make them fonder of each other, They are urged on by the fact that their relationship is
mutually beneficial. But neither of them harbours any thought of sleeping with the other,

This world order is generally believed to have been created by a Supreme Being

known as God, God, we are taught, loves all men so amazingly that Fle dees pood to all, the

grateful and the ungrateful alike. He: loves even the most unlovable snd docs not withbold His
