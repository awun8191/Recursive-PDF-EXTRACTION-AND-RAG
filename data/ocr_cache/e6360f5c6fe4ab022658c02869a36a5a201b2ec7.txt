Preface To The Twenty-Third Edition

It gives a great pleasure in presenting the new multicolour edition
of this popular book to innumerable students and academic staff of the
Universities in India and abroad. The favourable and warm reception,
which the previous editions and reprints of this book have enjoyed all over
India and abroad, has been a matter of great satisfaction.

The present edition of this book is in S.I. Units. To make the book
really useful at all levels, a number of articles as well as solved and
unsolved examples have been added. The mistakes, which had crept in,
have been eliminated. Three new chapters of Thick Cylindrical and Spherical
Shells, Bending of Curved Bars and Mechanical Properties of Materials
have also been added.

Any errors, omissions and suggestions for the improvement of this
volume, will be thankfully acknowledged and incorporated in the next
edition.

Preface To The First Edition

| take an opportunity to present Strength of Materials to the students
of Degree and Diploma, in general, and A.M.I.E (I) Section ‘A’ in particular.
The object of this book is to present the subject matter in most concise,
compact, to the point and lucid manner.

While writing the book, | have always kept in view the examination
requirements of the students and various difficulties and troubles, which they
face, while studying the subject. | have also, constantly, kept in view the re-
quirements of those intelligent students, who are always keen to increase
their knowledge. All along the approach to the subject matter, every care has
been taken to deal with each and every topic as well as problem from the
fundamentals and in the simplest possible manner, within the mathematical
ability of an average student. The subject matter has been amply illustrated
by incorporating a good number of solved, unsolved and well graded ex-
amples of almost every variety. Most of these examples are taken from the
recent examination papers of Indian as well as foreign Universities and pro-
fessional examining bodies, to make the students, familiar with the types of
questions, usually set in their examinations. At the end of each topic, a few
exercises have been added, for the students to solve them independently.
Answer to these problems have been provided, but it is too much to hope that
these are entirely free from errors. At the end of each chapter, Highlights
have been added, which summarise the main topics discussed in the chapter
for quick revision before the examination. In short, it is earnestly hoped that
the book will earn the appreciation of the teachers and students alike.

Although every care has been taken to check mistakes and misprints,
yet it is difficult to claim perfection. Any errors, omissions and suggestions for
the improvement of this volume, brought to my notice, will be thankfully ac-
knowledged and incorporated in the next edition.

Introduction

1.1. Definition

In day-to-day work, an engineer comes
across certain materials, i.e., steel girders, angle
irons, circular bars, cement etc., which are used
in his projects. While selecting a suitable
material, for his project, an engineer is always
interested to know its strength. The strength of
a material may be defined as ability, to resist its
failure and behaviour, under the action of
external forces. It has been observed that, under
the action of these forces, the material is first
deformed and then its failure takes place. A
detailed study of forces and their effects,
alongwith some suitable protective measures for
the safe working conditions, is known as
Strength of Materials. As a matter of fact, such

2 & Strength of Materials

a knowledge is very essential, for an engineer, to enable him, in designing all types of structures and
machines.

1.2. Fundamental Units

The measurements of physical quantities is one of the most important operations in engineering.
Every quantity is measured in terms of some arbitrary, but internationally accepted units, called fundamental
units. All the physical quantities, met with in Strength of Materials, are expressed in terms of the following
three fundamental quantities :

1. Length, 2. Mass and 3. Time.

1.3. Derived Units

Sometimes, physical quantities are expressed in other units, which are derived from fundamental
units, known as derived units, e.g., units of area, velocity, acceleration, pressure, etc.

1.4. Systems of Units

Following are only four systems of units, which are commonly used and universally recognised.
1. C.GS. units, 2. EP.S. units, 3. M.K.S. units and 4, S.I. units.

In this book, we shall use only the S.I. system of units, as the future courses of studies are
conducted in this system of units only.

1.5. S.I. Units (International System of Units)

The eleventh General Conference* of Weights and Measures has recommended a unified and
systematically constituted system of fundamental and derived units for international use. This system
of units is now being used in many countries. In India, the Standards of Weights and Measures Act of
1956 (vide which we switched over to M.K.S. units) has been revised to recognise all the S.I. units in
industry and commerce.

In this system of units, the +fundamental units are metre (m), kilogram (kg) and second (s)
respectively. But there is a slight variation in their derived units. The following derived units will be
used in this book :

Density (or Mass density) kg/m"
Force (in Newtons) N © kg.m/s’)
Pressure (in Pascals) Pa (= N/m’ = 10° N/mm’)
Stress (in Pascals) Pa (=N/m? =10° N/mm’)
Work done (in Joules) J (= N-m)
Power (in Watts) W (= J/s)
International metre, kilogram and second are discussed here.
1.6. Metre

The international metre may be defined as the shortest distance (at 0°C) between two parallel
lines engraved upon the polished surface of the Platinum-Iridium bar, kept at the International Bureau
of Weights and Measures at Sevres near Paris.

* — Jtis known as General Conference of Weights and Measures (G.C.W.M.). It is an international organisation
of which most of the advanced and developing countries (including India) are members. This conference
has been ensured the task of prescribing definitions of various units of weights and measures, which are
the very basis of science and technology today.

y+ The other fundamental units are electric current, ampere (A), thermodynamic temperature, kelvin (K)
and luminous intensity, candela (cd). These three units will not be used in this book.

1.7. Kilogram

The international kilogram may be defined as the mass of
the Platinum-Iridium cylinder, which is also kept at the
International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Sevres near

The standard platinum - kilogram is kept
‘ at the International Bureau of Weights
Paris. and Measures at Serves in France.

1.8. Second

The fundamental unit of time for all the four systems is second, which is 1/(24 x 60 x 60) =
1/86 400th of the mean solar day. A solar day may be defined as the interval of time between the
instants at which the sun crosses the meridian on two consecutive days. This value varies throughout
the year. The average of all the solar days, of one year, is called the mean solar day.

1.9. Presentation of Units and Their Values

The frequent changes in the present day life are facilitated by an international body known as
International Standard Organisation (ISO). The main function of this body is to make recommendations
regarding international procedures. The implementation of ISO recommendations in a country is
assisted by an organisation appointed for the purpose. In India, Bureau of Indian Standard formerly
known as Indian Standards Institution (ISI) has been created for this purpose.

We have already discussed in the previous articles the units of length, mass and time. It is always
necessary to express all lengths in metres, all masses in kilograms and all times in seconds. According
to convenience, we also use larger multiples or smaller fractions of these units. As a typical example,
although metre is the unit of length, yet a smaller length equal to one-thousandth of a metre proves to
be more convenient unit especially in the dimensioning of drawings. Such convenient units are formed
by using a prefix in front of the basic units to indicate the multiplier. The full list of these prefixes is
given in Table 1.1

1.10. Rules for S.I. Units

The Eleventh General Conference of Weights and Measures recommended only the fundamental
and derived units of S.I. system. But it did not elaborate the rules for the usage of these units. Later
on, many scientists and engineers held a number of meetings for the style and usage of S.I. units.
Some of the decisions of these meetings are :

1. A dash is to be used to separate units, which are multiplied together. For example, a newton-
meter is written as N-m. It should not be confused with mN, which stands for millinewton.

2. For numbers having 5 or more digits, the digits should be placed in groups of three separated
by spaces (instead of +}commas) counting both to the left and right of the decimal point.

3. Ina ¥++7four digit number, the space is not required unless the four digit number is used in a
column of numbers with 5 or more digits.

At the time of revising this book, the author sought the advice of various international authorities
regarding the use of units and their values, keeping in view the global reputation of the author as well
as his books. It was then decided to +}/}present the units and their values as per the recommendations
of ISO and ISI. It was decided to use :

4500 not 4 500 or 4,500

7 589 000 not 7589000 or 7,589,000
0.012 55 not 0.01255 or 012,55
30 x 10° not 3x 10’ or — 3,00,00,000

The above mentioned figures are meant for numerical values only. Now we shall discuss about
the units. We know that the fundamental units in S.I. system for length, mass and time are metre,
kilogram and second respectively. While expressing these quantities, we find it time-consuming to
write these units such as metres, kilograms and seconds, in full, every time we use them. As a result of
this, we find it quite convenient to use the following standard abbreviations, which are internationally
recognised. We shall use :

m for metre or metres
km for kilometre or kilometres
kg for kilogram or kilograms

* The prefixes are generally becoming obsolete probably due to possible confusion. Moreover, it is becoming
a conventional practice to use only those powers of ten which confirm to 10°” where n is a positive or
negative whole number.
+ In certain countries, comma is still used as the decimal marker.
+++ In certain countries, space is used even in a four digit number.
+777 In some question papers, standard values are not used. The author has tried to avoid such questions in the
text of the book, in order to avoid possible confusion. But at certain places, such questions have been
included keeping in view the importance of question from the reader’s angle.

Rule 1. Trigonometrical ratio changes only when the angle is (90° — 8) or (90° + 8). In all other cases,

trigonometrical ratio remains the same. Following is the law of change:
sin changes into cos and cos changes into sin,
tan changes into cot and cot changes into tan,
sec changes into cosec and cosec changes into sec.

Rule 2. Consider the angle 0 to be a small angle and write the proper sign as per formulae 8 to 11 above.

1.16. Scalar Quantities

The scalar quantities (or sometimes known as scalars) are those quantities which have magnitude
only such as length, mass, time, distance, volume, density, temperature, speed etc.

1.17. Vector Quantities

The vector quantities (or sometimes known as vectors) are those quantities which have both
magnitude and direction such as force, displacement, velocity, acceleration, momentum etc. Following
are the important features of vector quantities :

1. Representation of a vector. A vector is
represented by a directed line as shown in Fig. 1.2.

It may be noted that the length OA represents the O p

magnitude of the vector OA . The direction of the —
Fig. 1.2. Vector OA

—>
vector is OA is from O (i.e., starting point) to A
(i.e., end point). It is also known as vector P.

2. Unit vector. A vector, whose magnitude is unity, is known as unit vector.

3. Equal vectors. The vectors, which are parallel to each other and have same direction (i.e.,
same sense) and equal magnitude are known as equal vectors.

4. Like vectors. The vectors, whch are parallel to each other and have same sense but unequal
magnitude, are known as like vectors.

5. Addition of vectors. Consider two vectors PQ and RS, which are required to be added as
shown in Fig. 1.3 (a).

Take a point A, and draw
line AB parallel and equal in
magnitude to the vector PQ to
some convenient scale. Through B,
draw BC parallel and equal to
vector RS to the same scale. Join
AC which will give the required
sum of vectors PQ and RS as shown
in Fig. 1.3 (b).

This method of adding the
two vectors is called the Triangle
Law of Addition of Vectors.
Similarly, if more than two vectors
are to be added, the same may be
done first by adding the two
vectors, and then by adding the
third vector to the resultant of the
first two and so on. This method of
adding more than two vectors is
called Polygon Law of Addition of Vectors.

The velocity of this cyclist is an example of a vector quantity.

difference of the vectors PQ and RS as shown in Fig. 1.4 (b).

1.18. Force

It is an important factor in the field of Engineering-science, which may be defined as an agent
which produces or tends to produce, destroys or tends to destroy motion.

1.19. Resultant Force

If a number of forces P, Q, R......... etc., are acting simultaneously on a particle, then a single
force, which will produce the same effect as that of all the given forces, is known as a resultant force.
The forces P, Q, R.... etc., are called component forces. The resultant force of the component forces
or the point through which it acts may be found out either mathematically or graphically.

1.20. Composition of Forces

It means the process of finding out the resultant force of the given component forces. A resultant
force may be found out analytically, graphically or by the following laws :

1.21. Parallelogram Law of Forces

It states, “If two forces acting simultaneously on a particle be represented, in magnitude and direction,
by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram, their resultant may be represented, in magnitude and direction,
by the diagonal of the parallelogram passing through the point of their intersection.”

Chapter 1: Introduction m 11

1.22. Triangle Law of Forces

It states, “If two forces acting simultaneously on a particle be represented in magnitude and
direction, by the two sides of a triangle taken in order, their resultant may be represented, in magnitude
and direction, by the third side of the triangle taken in opposite order.”

1.23. Polygon Law of Forces

It states, “Tf a number of forces acting simultaneously on a particle be represented in magnitude
and direction by the sides of a polygon taken in order, their resultant may be represented, in magnitude
and direction, by the closing side of the polygon taken in opposite order.”

1.24. Moment of a Force

It is the turning effect, produced by the force, on a body on which it acts. It is mathematically
equal to the product of the force and the perpendicular distance between the line of action of the force
and the point about which the moment is required.

23.1. Introduction

We have already discussed in chapters 19 and
20 that whenever a cantilever or a beam is loaded,
it gets deflected. As a matter of fact, the amount
by which a cantilever or a beam may deflect, is so
small that it is hardly detected by the residents.
But sometimes, due to inaccurate design or bad
workmanship, the deflection of the free end of a
cantilever (or centre of the beam) is so much that
the residents are always afraid of its falling down
and it effects their health. In order to set right the
deflected cantilever or a beam or more precisely
to avoid the deflection to some extent, it is propped
up (i.e., supported by some vertical pole at the
original level before deflection) at some suitable
point. Such an arrangement of providing a sup-

port is known as propping and the cantilever or beam is known as propped cantilever or propped
beam.

Consider a cantilever beam AB fixed at A and propped at B as shown in Fig. 23.1 (a). Let the
cantilever be subjected to some loading (say uniformly distributed load) as shown in the figure.
It has been experimentally found that this prop will be subjected to some reaction. This reaction
can be obtained as discussed below:
1. Imagine the prop to be removed and calculate the deflection of the free end B as shown in Fig.
23.1 (b).
2. Now imagine a prop to be introduced at B, which will exert an upward force P equal to the
reaction of the prop. It will cause an upward deflection of B due to the prop reaction as shown
in Fig. 23.1 (c).
3. Now by equating the downward deflection due to the load and the upward deflection due to the
prop reaction, the reaction of the prop may be found out.

23.3. Propped Cantilever with a Uniformly Distributed Load
Consider a cantilever AB fixed at and propped at B and carrying a uniformly distributed load
over its entire span as shown in Fig. 23.2 (a).
Let 1 = Span of the cantilever AB,
w = Uniformly distributed load per unit length over the entire span and
P = Reaction at the prop.
We know that the downward deflection of B due to uniformly distributed load (neglecting prop
reaction),

* Very often the students commit the mistake of finding out the prop reactions by equating the clockwise
moments (due to load on cantilever) to the anticlockwise moment (due to the prop reaction) about the
fixed end; as they would do in the case of a simply supported beam. This practice does not hold good in
this case, as the net moment at the fixed end is not zero. There exists a fixing moment, which can not be
determined unless the prop reaction is known.

23.6. Sinking of the Prop

In the previous articles, we have assumed that the prop in a cantilever or beam behaves like a
rigid one i.e., it does not yield down due to the load acting on the beam. But sometimes, the prop sinks
down, due to its elastic property and the reaction. A sinking prop is called an elastic prop or yielding
prop.

Let 5 = Distance through which the prop has sunk down, due to load.

y, = Downward deflection of the beam, at the point of prop and
y, = Upward deflection of the beam, due to the prop reaction,
A little consideration will show that if the prop would not have sunk down, then

2.1. Introduction

In our daily life, we see that whenever a load
is attached to a thin hanging wire, it elongates
and the load moves downwards (sometimes
through a negligible distance). The amount, by
which the wire elongates, depends upon the
amount of load and the nature as well as cross-
sectional area of the wire material. It has been
experimentally found that the cohesive force,
between molecules of the hanging wire, offers
resistance against the deformation, and the force
of resistance increases with the deformation. It
has also been observed that the process of
deformation stops when the force of resistance is
equal to the external force (i.e., the load attached).
Sometimes, the force of resistance, offered by

Chapter 2 : Simple Stresses and Strains m 13

the molecules, is less than the external force. In such a case, the deformation continues until failure
takes place.

In the succeeding pages, we shall discuss the effects produced by the application of loads, on the
materials. Before entering into the details of the effects, following few terms should be clearly understood
at this stage.

2.2. Elasticity

We have already discussed in the last article that whenever a force acts on a body, it undergoes
some deformation and the molecules offer some resistance to the deformation. It will be interesting to
know that when the external force is removed, the force of resistance also vanishes ; and the body
springs back to its original position. But it is only possible, if the deformation, caused by the external
force, is within a certain limit. Such a limit is called elastic limit. The property of certain materials of
returning back to their original position, after removing the external force, is known as elasticity. A
body is said to be perfectly elastic, if it returns back completely to its original shape and size, after the
removal of external forces. If the body does not return back completely to its original shape and size,
after the removal of the external force, it is said to be partially elastic.

It has been observed that if the force, acting on a body, causes its deformation beyond the elastic
limit, the body loses, to some extent, its property of elasticity. If the external force, after causing
deformation beyond the elastic limit, is completely removed, the body will not return back to its original
shape and size. There will be some residual deformation to the body, which will remain permanently.

2.3. Stress

Every material is elastic in nature. That is why, whenever some external system of forces acts on
a body, it undergoes some deformation. As the body undergoes deformation, its molecules set up
some resistance to deformation. This resistance per unit area to deformation, is known as stress.
Mathematically stress may be defined as the force per unit area i.e., stress.

sie
~ A
where P = Load or force acting on the body, and

A = Cross-sectional area of the body.
In S.I. system, the unit of stress is pascal (Pa) which is equal to 1 N/m’. In actual practice, we use
bigger units of stress i.e., megapascal (MPa) and gigapascal (GPa), which is equal to N/mm” or kN/
mm* respectively.

2.4. Strain

As already mentioned, whenever a single force (or a system of forces) acts on a body, it undergoes
some deformation. This deformation per unit length is known as strain. Mathematically strain may be
defined as the deformation per unit length. i.e., strain

€ = a or l= el
where ol = Change of length of the body, and

l

Original length of the body.

2.5. Types of Stresses

Though there are many types of stresses, yet the following two types of stresses are important
from the subject point of view :

1. Tensile stress. 2. Compressive stress.

14 m& Strength of Materials

2.6. Tensile Stress

When a section is subjected to two equal and opposite pulls and the body tends to increase its
length, as shown in Fig. 2.1, the stress induced is called tensile stress. The corresponding strain is
called tensile strain. As a result of the tensile stress, the *cross-sectional area of the body gets
reduced.

Fig. 2.1. Tensile stress Fig. 2.2. Compressive stress

2.7. Compressive Stress

When a section is subjected to two equal and opposite pushes and the body tends to shorten its
length, as shown in Fig. 2.2, the stress induced is called compressive stress. The corresponding strain
is called compressive strain. As a result of the compressive stress, the cross-sectional area of the body
gets increased.

2.8. Elastic Limit

We have already discussed that whenever some external system of forces acts on a body, it
undergoes some deformation. If the external forces, causing deformation, are removed the body
springs back to its original position. It has been found that for a given section there is a limiting
value of force up to and within which, the deformation entirely disappears on the removal of force.
The value of intensity of stress (or simply stress) corresponding to this limiting force is called
elastic limit of the material.

Beyond the elastic limit, the material gets into plastic stage and in this stage the deformation
does not entirely disappear, on the removal of the force. But as a result of this, there is a residual
deformation even after the removal of the force.

2.9. Hooke’s Law**

It states, “When a material is loaded, within its elastic limit, the stress is proportional to the
strain.” Mathematically,

Stress

Strain = E = Constant

It may be noted that Hooke’s Law equally holds good for tension as well as compression.

* Since the volume of the body remains constant, therefore an increase in the length will automatically
reduce the cross-sectional area of the body. Similarly a decrease in the length will automatically increase
the cross-sectional area of the body.

As a matter of fact, there is a relationship between the increase (or decrease) in length of the body and
decrease (or increase) in the cross-sectional area of the body. This relation will be discussed in
Art. 6.6.

** Named after Robert Hooke, who first established it by experiments in 1678. While making tensile
tests on a metallic bar, he took enough precautions, to ensure that the force is applied axially and the
bending of the bar is prevented. He assumed that during tension, all the longitudinal fibres of the bar
have the same elongation. All the cross-sections of the bar, which were originally plane, remain so
even after extension.

2.10. Modulus of Elasticity or Young’s Modulus (E)

loaded, within its elastic limit, the stress is proportional to
strain. Mathematically stress,

known as modulus of elasticity or
Young’s modulus. Numerically, it
is that value of tensile stress, which
when applied to a uniform bar will
increase its length to double the
original length if the material of the
bar could remain perfectly elastic
throughout such an excessive
strain.

Notes: 1. The above formula holds good for compressive stress also.
2. For most of the structural materials, the modulus of elasticity for compression is the same as that for
tension.
3. Sometimes in calculations, the tensile stress and tensile strain are taken as positive, whereas com-
pressive stress and compressive strain as negative.

Sometimes, a body is subjected to a number of forces acting on its outer edges as well as at some
other sections, along the length of the body. In such a case, the forces are split up and their effects are
considered on individual sections. The resulting deformation, of the body, is equal to the algebraic
sum of the deformations of the individual sections. Such a principle, of finding out the resultant
deformation, is called the principle of superposition.

The relation for the resulting deformation may be modified as:

Pl
ol = AE AE (P, 1, +P, 1,+ P,1,+..-)
where P, = Force acting on section 1,
1, = Length of section 1,
P,, 1, = Corresponding values of section 2, and so on.

In the last chapter, we have discussed the
procedure of obtaining stresses and strains in the
bars of uniform cross-sectional area. But
sometimes we come across bars of varying
sections in which we are required to find out the
stresses and strains. The procedure for finding
out the stresses and strains in same sections is
slightly different.

varying sections, in the field of strength of

3. Bars of composite sections.

separately as usual. The total changes in length is equal to the sum of the changes of all the individual
lengths. It may be noted that each section is subjected to the same external axial pull or push.

3.6. Stresses in the Bars of Uniformly Tapering Rectangular Sections

Sometimes, the uniformly tapering section varies from square section at one end to another
square section at the other. Or it may also vary from rectangular section at one end to another rectangular

section at the other. In such cases, the stresses should be found out from the fundamentals.

EXAMPLE 3.13. An alloy bar of 1 m length has square section throughout, which tapers from
one end of 10 mm x 10 mm to the other end of 20 mm x 20 mm. Find the change in its length due

to an axial tensile load of 30 KN. Take E for the alloy as 120 GPa.

So.uTion. Given: Length of bar (/) = 1 m= 1 x 10° mm ; Section atA = 10 mm x 10 mm;
Section at B = 20 mm x 20 mm ; Tensile load (P) = 30 kN = 30 x 10° N and modulus of elastictiy (E)

3.7. Stresses in the Bars of Composite Structures

A bar made up of two or more different materials, joined together is called a composite bar. The
bars are joined in such a manner, that the system extends or contracts as one unit, equally, when
subjected to tension or compression. Following two points should always be kept in view, while
solving example on composite bars :

42 @ Strength of Materials

1. Extension or contraction of the bar is equal. Therefore strain (i.e., deformation per unit length)

is also equal.

2. The total external load, on the bar, is equal to the sum of the loads
carried by the different materials.

Consider a composite bar made up of two different materials as shown in

Notes: 1. For the sake of simplicity, we have considered the composite bar made up of two different materials

2. If the lengths of the two bars are different, then elongations should be separately calculated and
equated.

4.1. Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have been
discussing the cases, where simple equations of
statics were sufficient to solve the examples. But,
sometimes, the simple equations are not sufficient
to solve such problems. Such problems are called
statically indeterminate problems and the
structures are called statically indeterminate
structures.

For solving statically indeterminate
problems, the deformation characteristics of the
structure are also taken into account alongwith
the statical equilibrium equations. Such
equations, which contain the deformation
characteristics, are called compatibility equations.
The formation of such compatibility equations
needs lot of patience and consideration. The

48 m Strength of Materials

solution of such statically indeterminate structures is somewhat different than the solution of simple
sections and varying sections as discussed in chapters 2 and 3. So we have to adopt some indirect
methods also for solving problems on statically indeterminate structures.

4.2. Types of Statically Indeterminate Structures

Though there are many types of statically indeterminate structures in the field of Strength of
Materials yet the following are important from the subject point of view :

1. Simple statically indeterminate structures.
2. Indeterminate structures supporting a load.
3. Composite structures of equal lengths.

4. Composite structures of unequal lengths.

Now we shall study the procedures for the stresses and strains in the above mentioned indeterminate
structures in the following pages. In order to solve the above mentioned types of statically indeterminate
structures, we have to use different types of compatible equations.

4.3. Stresses in Simple Statically Indeterminate Structures

The structures in which the stresses can be obtained by forming two or more equations are called
simple statically indeterminate structures. The stresses in such structures may be found out with the
help of two or three compatible equations.

Sometimes, we come across a set of two or more members supporting a load. In such cases, the
deformation of all the members will be the same. If the members are of different cross-sections or
have different modulus of elasticity, then the stresses developed in all the members will be different.

We have already discussed in Art 3.6 the procedure for stresses in the bars of composite sections.
The same principle can be extended to the statically indeterminate structures also. Though there are

many types of such structures, yet a rod passing axially through a pipe is an important structure from
the subject point of view.

inside a hollow copper tube of external diameter 30 mm and internal diameter 25 mm. The ends

It is more than the permissible stress in the steel (which is given as 120 N/mm’). Therefore we

It is less than the permissible stress in brass (which is given as 70 N/mm”). Thus we shall take the

some of the load (or force) is utilised in extending the member and making its length equal to the

other member. Now the remaining load is shared by both the members.

increase in length AB is 2.5 mm, therefore, first action of the 50 KN load will be to increase the length

action of the 600 KN load will be to decrease the length of the aluminium tube by 0.5 mm, till its

In our daily life, we use nuts and bolts to tighten the components of a machine or structure. It is
generally done by placing washers below the nuts as shown in Fig. 4.25.

As a matter of fact, a nut can be easily tightened, till the space between the two washers becomes
exactly equal to the body placed between them. It will be interesting to know that if we further tighten
the nut, it will induce some load in the assembly. As a result of this, bolt will be subjected to some
tension, whereas the washers and body between them will be subjected to some compression. And the
induced load will be equally shared between the bolt and the body. Now consider an assembly con-
sisting of two nuts and a bolt alongwith a tube as shown in the figure.

5.1. Introduction

It has been established since long, that
whenever there is some increase or decrease in
the temperature of a body, it causes the body to
expand or contract. A little consideration will
show that if the body is allowed to expand or
contract freely, with the rise or fall of the
temperature, no stresses are induced in the body.
But if the deformation of the body is prevented,
some stresses are induced in the body. Such
stresses are called thermal stresses or temperature
stresses. The corresponding strain are called
thermal strains or temperature strains.

Chapter 5 : Thermal Stresses and Strains m= 73

5.2. Thermal Stresses in Simple Bars

The thermal stresses or strains, in a simple bar, may be found out as discussed below :

1. Calculate the amount of deformation due to change of temperature with the assumption that
bar is free to expand or contract.

2. Calculate the load (or force) required to bring the deformed bar to the original length.
3. Calculate the stress and strain in the bar caused by this load.

The thermal stresses or strains may also be found out first by finding out amount of deformation
due to change in temperature, and then by finding out the thermal strain due to the deformation. The
thermal stress may now be found out from the thermal strain as usual. Now consider a body subjected
to an increase in temperature.

Let 1 = Original length of the body,

shown in Fig. 5.6 (a).

Let the bar be heated through some temperature. If the component members of the bar (.e., steel
and brass) could have been free to expand, then no internal stresses would have induced. But, since
the two members are rigidly fixed, therefore the composite bar, as a whole, will expand by the same
amount. We know that the brass expands more than the steel (because the coefficient of linear expansion
of the brass is greater than that of the steel). Therefore the free expansion of the brass will be more
than that of the steel. But since both the members are not free to expand, therefore the expansion of
the composite bar, as a whole, will be less than that of the brass; but more than that of the steel as
shown in Fig. 5.6 (b). It is thus obvious that the brass will be subjected to compressive force, whereas
the steel will be subjected to tensile force as shown in Fig. 5.6 (c).

Now let ©, = Stress in brass

€, = Strain in brass,
a, = Coefficient of linear expansion for brass,
A, = Cross-sectional area of brass bar,

All the three bars are fastened together at room temperature. Find the stresses in each bar,
where the temperature of the whole assembly is raised through 50°C. Assume :

Young’s modulus for steel = 200 GPa

We also know that when the temperature of the assembly will increase, the free expansion of
aluminium bars will be more than that of steel bar (because 0, is more than o,). Thus the aluminium
bars will be subjected to compressive stress and the steel bar will be subjected to tensile stress. Since
the tensile load on the steel bar is equal to the compressive load on the aluminium bars, therefore

A little consideration will show that due to rise in temperature, the free expansion of the copper
member will be more than that of the steel member (because 0 is more than O.,). Hence the copper
member will be subjected to compressive stress, whereas the steel member will be subjected to tensile
stress.

Let O, = Stress in the portion AB of the steel bar due to increase in

5.6. Superposition of Thermal Stresses

In the last articles, we have been discussing the thermal stresses in the bars, which were initially
free of any type of tensile or compressive stresses. But sometimes, we come across structures, which
are subjected to same loading, before their temperature is increased or decreased. Such problems are
solved in the following two steps :

1. First of all, find out the stresses caused in its members before there is any change in
temperature.

2. Now find out the stresses due to change in temperature and use the principal of superposition
on the stresses already obtained.

3. Finally add the two stresses obtained above.

Note: Such problems are very complicated and need lot of patience in knowing the type of stresses (i.e.,
tensile or compressive) in both the cases.

6.1. Introduction

In the previous chapter, we have discussed
the axial deformation of a body, when it is
subjected to a direct tensile or compressive stress.
But we have not discussed the lateral or side
effects of the pulls or pushes. It has been
experimentally found, that the axial strain of a
body is always followed by an opposite kind of
strain in all directions at right angle to it. Thus, in
general, there is always a set of the following two
types of strains in a body, when it is subjected to
a direct stress.

1. Primary or linear strain, and
2. Secondary or lateral strain.

6.2. Primary or Linear Strain

Fig. 6.1. Linear and Lateral strain
We have already discussed in Art 2.2 that whenever some external force acts on a body, it
undergoes some deformation. Now consider a circular bar subjected to a tensile force as shown in
Fig. 6.1 (a).
Let l = Length of the bar,
d
P

dl = Increase in the length of the bar, as a result of the tensile force.

Diameter of the bar,

Tensile force acting on the bar, and

The deformation of the bar per unit length in the direction of the force, i.e., “ is known as

primary or linear strain.

6.3. Secondary or Lateral Strain

We have already discussed in the last article the linear deformation of a circular bar of length
J and diameter d subjected to a tensile force P. If we actually study the deformation of the bar, we
will find that bar has extended through a length 8/, which will be followed by the decrease of
diameter from d to (d— 6d) as shown in Fig. 6.1 (b). Similarly, if the bar is subjected to a compres-
sive force, the length of the bar will decrease by 8/ which will be followed by the increase of
diameter from d to (d + 6d).

It is thus obvious that every direct stress is always accompanied by a strain in its own direction
and an opposite kind of strain in every direction at right angles to it. Such a strain is known as
secondary or lateral strain.

6.4. *Poisson’s Ratio

It has been experimentally found, that if a body is stressed within its elastic limit, the lateral strain
bears a constant ratio to the linear strain. Mathematically :

Lateral strain
—— = (constant)
Linear strain

This constant is known as Poisson’s ratio and is denoted by my OH Mathematically,

. 1
Lateral strain = me e=He

* Named after French mathematician Poisson, who first predicted its existence and value by using the
molcular theory of structure of the material. He found this value for many isotropic materials (i.e., the
materials which have the same properties in all directions).

Chapter 6 : Elastic Constants m 93

The corresponding change in the lateral length may be found out, as usual, i.e., by multiplying
the lateral length (i.e., width or thickness).

Note. The value of Poisson’s ratio is the same in tension and compression.

The value of Poisson’s ratio of materials, in every day use, are given below :

increase in thickness 0.04 mm, find the values of Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for the bar
material.

6.5. Volumetric Strain

We have already discussed that whenever a body is subjected to a single force (or a system of
forces), it undergoes some changes in its dimensions. A little consideration will show, that the change
in dimensions of a body will cause some changes in its volume. The ratio of change in volume, to the

original volume, is known as volumetric strain. Mathematically volumetric strain,

éV
fy = Vy
where SV = Change in volume, and

V = Original volume.

Though there are numerous ways, in which a force (or a system of forces) may act, yet the

following are important from the subject point of view :
1. A rectangular body subjected to an axial force.
2. A rectangular body subjected to three mutually perpendicular forces.

Now we shall discuss the volumetric strains on all the types of bodies one by one in the following

6.10. Shear Stress

When a section is subjected to two equal and opposite forces, acting tangentially across the
resisting section, as a result of which the body tends to shear off across the section as shown in Fig.
6.8, the stress induced is called shear stress. The corresponding strain is called shear strain.

Consider a cube of length | fixed at the bottom face AB. Let a force P be applied at the face DC,
tangentially to the face AB. As a result of the force, let the cube be distorted from ABCD to AB C, D,

6.11. Principle of Shear Stress

It states, “A shear stress across a plane, is always accompanied by a balancing shear stress
across the plane and normal to it.”

Proof

Consider a rectangular block ABCD, subjected to a shear stress of ,
intensity Tt on the faces AD and CB as shown in Fig. 6.10. Now consider D
a unit thickness of the block. Therefore force acting on the faces AD
and CB, «| | T

P =tx.AD=TXCB

A little consideration will show that these forces willformacouple, 4 —_ B
whose moment is equal to T x AD x AB i.e., force x distance. If the v
block is in equilibrium, there must be a restoring couple, whose mo- _ Fig- 6.10. Princciple of
ment must be equal to this couple. Let the shear stress of intensity Tt be shear stress

set up on the faces AB and CD as shown in Fig. 6.10. Therefore forces
acting on the faces AB and CD,.

P=v7xAB=1xCD

104 m& Strength of Materials

We see that these forces will also form a couple, whose moment is equal to t’ x AD x AB i.e.,
force x distance. Equating these two moments, we get
tx ADXAB = UxADXAB

J

or T= T

As a result of the two couples formed by the shear forces, the diagonal BD of the block will be
subjected to tension whereas the diagonal AC will be subjected to compression. A little consideration
will show that if the block material is poor in tension, it will fail due to excessive tensile stress across
the diagonal BD. Similarly if the block material is poor in compression, it will fail due to excessive
compressive forces across the diagonal AC.
Note. The stress 7’ is called complementary shear. The two stresses (i.e., T and 1’) at right angles to each other

constitute a state of simple shear.

6.12. Shear Modulus or Modulus of Rigidity

It has been experimentally found that within the elastic limit, the shear stress is proportional to
the shear strain. Mathematically

Thus we see that the linear strain of the diagonal BD is half of the shear strain and is tensile in

nature. Similarly it can be proved that the linear strain of the diagonal AC is also equal to half of the

8.1. Introduction

We have studied in Chapter 2 that whenever
some load is attached to a hanging wire, it extends
and the load moves downwards by an amount
equal to the extension of the wire. A little
consideration will show that when the load moves
downwards, it loses its *potential energy. This
energy is absorbed ( or stored ) in the stretched
wire, which may be released by removing the load.
On removing the load, the wire will spring back
to its original position. This energy, which is
absorbed in a body, when strained within its elastic

limit, is known as strain energy. It has been experimentally found that this strain energy is always
capable of doing some work. The amount of strain energy, in a body is found out by the principal of
work. Mathematically

Strain energy = Work done

8.2. Resilience

It is a common term used for the total strain energy stored in a body. Sometimes the resilience is
also defined as the capacity of a strained body for doing work (when it springs back) on the removal of
the straining force.

8.3. Proof Resilience

It is also a common term, used for the maximum strain energy, which can be stored in a body. (This
happens when the body is stressed up to the elastic limit). The corresponding stress is known as proof stress.

8.4. Modulus of Resilience

The proof resilience per unit volume of a material, is known as modulus of resilience and is an
important property of the material.

8.5. Types of Loading

In the previous chapter, we have solved the problems on the assumption that the load applied was
gradual. But in actual practice, it is not always possible that the load may act gradually. As a matter of
fact, a load may act in either of the following three ways:

1. gradually. 2. suddenly. 3. with impact.

Now in the succeeding pages, we shall discuss the work done, or in other words strain energy
stored in a body, when loaded in any one of the above mentioned loadings.

8.6. Strain Energy Stored in a Body, when the Load is Gradually
Applied
It is the most common and practical way of loading a body, in which the loading starts from zero
and increases gradually till the body is fully loaded. e.g., when we lower a body with the help of a
crane, the body first touches the platform on which it is to be placed. On further releasing the chain,
the platform goes on loading till it is fully loaded by the body. This is the case of a gradually applied
load. Now consider a metallic bar subjected to a gradual load.

Let P = Load gradually applied,
A = Cross-sectional area of the bar,
l Length of the bar,
E Modulus of elasticity of the bar material and
5 = Deformation of the bar due to load.

Since the load applied is gradual, and varies from zero to P, therefore the average load is equal to f

8.7. Strain Energy Stored in a Body when the Load is Suddenly
Applied
Sometimes in factories and workshops, the load is suddenly applied on a body. e.g., when we
lower a body with the help of a crane, the body is, first of all, just above the platform on which it is to

be placed. If the chain breaks at once at this moment the whole load of the body begins to act on the
platform. This is the case of a suddenly applied load. Now consider a bar subjected to a sudden load.

P = Load applied suddenly,

Since the load is applied suddenly, therefore the load (P) is constant throughout the process of

It means that the stress induced in this case is twice the stress induced when the same load is

applied gradually. Once the stress (6), is obtained, the corresponding instantaneous deformation (8/)
and the strain energy may be found out as usual.

8.8. Strain Energy Stored in a Body, when the Load is Applied
with Impact
Sometimes in factories and workshops, the impact load is applied
on a body e.g., when we lower a body with the help of a crane, and the Load
chain breaks while the load is being lowered the load falls through a
distance, before it touches the platform. This is the case of a load applied
with impact.
Now consider a bar subject to a load applied with impact as shown
in Fig 8.1.

strain energy stored in the bar.

Stress induced in the bar

We know that in this case, extension of the bar will be small and negligible as compared to the
height (h) from where the weight falls on the collar (due to small value of weight i.e., 2 KN and a large
value of h i.e., 100 mm). Therefore stress induced in the bar

determine the stress developed in the bar. What will be the strain energy stored in the bar? Take E

modulus of elasticity (E) = 200 GPa = 20 x 10° N/mm’.

Stress developed in the bar

We know that in this case, extension of the bar will be considerable as compared to the height (/)
from where the weight falls on the collar (due to a large value of weight i.e., 15 KN and a small value

7.1. Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have studied
in detail, the direct tensile and compressive
stress as well as simple shear. In these chapters,
we have always referred the stress in a plane,
which is at right angles to the line of action of
the force (in case of direct tensile or
compressive stress). Moreover, we have
considered at a time one type of stress, acting
in one direction only. But the majority of
engineering, component and structures are
subjected to such loading conditions (or
sometimes are of such shapes) that there exists
a complex state of stresses; involving direct
tensile and compressive stress as well as shear
stress in various directions. Now in this chapter

Chapter 7 : Principal Stresses and Strains m 109

we shall study the nature and intensity of stresses on planes, other than that, which is at right
angles to the line of action of the force.

7.2. Principal Planes

It has been observed that at any point in a strained material, there are three planes, mutually
perpendicular to each other, which carry direct stresses only, and no shear stress. A little
consideration will show that out of these three direct stresses one will be maximum, the other
minimum, and the third an intermediate between the two. These particular planes, which have no
shear stress, are known as principal planes.

7.3. Principal Stress

The magnitude of direct stress, across a principal plane, is known as principal stress. The
determination of principal planes, and then principal stress is an important factor in the design of
various structures and machine components.

7.4. Methods for the Stresses on an Oblique Section of a Body
The following two methods for the determination of stresses on an oblique section of a strained
body are important from the subject point of view :
1. Analytical method and 2. Graphical method.

7.5. Analytical Method for the Stresses on an Oblique Section
of a Body
Here we shall first discuss the analytical method for the determination of stresses on an oblique
section in the following cases, which are important from the subject point of view :
1. A body subjected to a direct stress in one plane.

2. A body subjected to direct stresses in two mutually perpendicular directions.

7.6. Sign Conventions for Analytical Method

Though there are different sign conventions, used in different books, yet we shall adopt the
following sign conventions, which are widely used and internationally recognised :

1. A\ll the tensile stresses and strains are taken as positive, whereas
all the compressive stresses and strains are taken as negative.

2. The well established principles of mechanics is used for the shear
stress. The shear stress which tends to rotate the element in the
clockwise direction is taken as positive, whereas that which tends
to rotate in an anticlockwise direction as negative.

In the element shown in Fig. 7.1, the shear stress on the vertical
faces (or x-x axis) is taken as positive, whereas the shear stress on the
horizontal faces (or y-y axis) is taken as negative.

Fig. 7.1

7.7. Stresses on an Oblique Section of a Body Subjected to a
Direct Stress in One Plane

Consider a rectangular body of uniform cross-sectional area and unit thickness subjected to a
direct tensile stress along x-x axis as shown in Fig. 7.2 (a). Now let us consider an oblique section AB

find out the stresses as shown in the figure).

First of all, consider the equilibrium of an element or wedge ABC whose free body diagram is
shown in fig 7.2 (b) and (c). We know that the horizontal force acting on the face AC,

Resolving the force perpendicular or normal to the section AB

(0).
We know that the stress across the section AB

= ocos 0
Now resolving the stress normal to the section AB,
oO, = 6 cos @. cos 0 = 6 cos’ 8
and now resolving the stress along the section AB

T = Osin®@.cos 0

Chapter 7 : Principal Stresses and Strains m 111

It will be interesting to know from equation (iii) above that the normal stress across the section
AB will be maximum, when sin’ @ = 1 or sin 9 = 1 or 0=90°. Or in other words, the face AC will carry
the maximum direct stress. Similarly, the shear stress across the section AB will be maximum when
sin 20 = 1 or 20 = 90° or 270°. Or in other words, the shear stress will be maximum on the planes
inclined at 45° and 135° with the line of action of the tensile stress. Therefore maximum shear stress
when 8 is equal to 45°,

and maximum shear stress, when @ is equal to 135°,

oO. fe} [e)
Trax = “7 sin 270° = oY (-l) = 2

It is thus obvious that the magnitudes of maximum shear stress is half of the tensile stress. Now
the resultant stress may be found out from the relation :

Or = fe)

Note : The planes of maximum and minimum normal stresses (i.e. principal planes) may also be found out by
equating the shear stress to zero. This happens as the normal stress is either maximum or minimum on
a plane having zero shear stress. Now equating the shear stress to zero,
osin@cos@ = 0
It will be interesting to know that in the above equation either sin 8 is equal to zero or cos 8 is
equal to zero. We know that if sin is zero, then @ is equal to 0°. Or in other words, the plane coincides
with the line of action of the tensile stress. Similarly, if cos @ is zero, then @ is equal to 90°. Or in other
words, the plane is at right angles to the line of action of the tensile stress. Thus we see that there are
two principal planes, at right angles to each other, one of them coincides with the line of action of the
stress and the other at right angles to it.

7.12. Graphical Method for the Stresses on an Oblique Section
of a Body

In the previous articles, we have been discussing the analytical method for the determination of
normal, shear and resultant stresses across a section. But we shall now discuss a graphical method for
this purpose. This is done by drawing a Mohr’s Circle of Stresses. The construction of Mohr’s Circle
of Stresses as well as determination of normal, shear and resultant stresses is very easier than the
analytical method. Moreover, there is a little chance of committing any error in this method. In the
following pages, we shall draw the Mohr’s Circle of Stresses for the following cases :

1. A body subjected to a direct stress in one plane.

A body subjected to direct stresses in two mutually perpendicular directions.

A body subjected to a simple shear stress.

A body subjected to a direct stress in one plane accompanied by a simple shear stress.

we Yd

A body subjected to direct stresses in two mutually perpendicular directions accompanied by a
simple shear stress.

7.13. Sign Conventions for Graphical Method

Though there are different sign conventions used in different books for graphical method also, yet
we shall adopt the following sign conventions, which are widely used and internationally recognised :
1. The angle is taken with reference to the X-X axis. All the angles traced in the anticlockwise
direction to the X-X axis are taken as negative, whereas those in the clockwise direction as
positive as shown in Fig. 7.13 (a). The value of angle 8, until and unless mentioned is taken as
positive and drawn clockwise.
2. The measurements above X-X axis and to the right of Y-Y axis are taken as positive, whereas
those below X-X axis and to the left of Y-Y axis as negative as shown in Fig 7.13 (b) and (c).
3. Sometimes there is a slight variation in the results obtained by analytical method and graphical
method. The values obtained by graphical method are taken to be correct if they agree upto the
first decimal point with values obtained by analytical method, e.g., 8.66 (Analytical) = 8.7
(Graphical), similarly 4.32 (Analytical) = 4.3 (Graphical)

Consider a rectangular body of uniform cross-sectional area and unit thickness subjected to a direct

1. First of all, take some suitable point O and through it draw a horizontal line XOX.

2. Cut off OJ equal to the tensile stress (6) to some suitable scale and towards right (because o is
tensile). Bisect OJ at C. Now the point O represents the stress system on plane BC and the point

J represents the stress system on plane AC.

3. Now with C as centre and radius equal to CO and or CJ draw a circle. It is known as Mohr’s

( Consider a rectangular body of uniform cross-sectional area and unit thickness subjected to
direct tensile stresses in two mutually perpendicular directions along X-X and Y-Y axes accompanied
by a positive (i.e., clockwise) shear stress along X-X axis as shown in Fig. 7.25 (a) and (b). Now let us
consider an oblique section AB inclined with X-X axis on which we are required to find out the
stresses as shown in the figure.

Let ©, = Tensile stress in X-X direction,
oO, = Tensile stress in Y-Y direction,
Ty = Positive (i.e., clockwise) shear stress along X-X axis, and
8 = Angle which the oblique section AB makes with X-X axis in

clockwise direction.

First of all, consider the equilibrium of the wedge ABC. We know that as per the principle of
simple shear, the face BC of the wedge will be subjected to an anticlockwise shear stress equal to
T, as shown in Fig. 7.25 (b). Now draw the Mohr’s Circle of Stresses as shown in Fig. 7.26 and as
discussed below :

1. First of all, take some suitable point O and through it draw a horizontal line OX.

Cut off OJ and OK equal to the tensile stresses o,, and 6, respectively to some suitable scale and
towards right (because both the stresses are tensile).

3. Now erect a perpendicular at J above the line X-X (because T, 18 positive along X-X axis) and
cut off JD equal to the shear stress T,,, to the scale. The point D represents the stress system on
plane AC. Similarly, erect perpendicular below the line X-X (because T,,, is negative along Y-Y
axis) and cut off KE equal to the shear stress T,,, to the scale. The point E represents the plane
BC. Join DE and bisect it at C.

4. Now with C as centre and radius equal to CD or CE draw a circle. It is known as Mohr’s Circle
of Stresses.

5. Now through C, draw a line CP making an angle 20 with CE in clockwise direction meeting the
circle at P. The point P represents the stress system on section AB.

6. Through P, draw PQ perpendicular to the line OX. Join OP.

7. Now OQ, QP and OP will give the normal stress, shear stress and resultant stress respectively to
the scale. Similarly OG and OH will give the maximum and minimum principal shear stresses to
the scale. The angle POC is called the angle of obliquity.

9.1. Introduction

It has been established, since long, that every
particle of a body is attracted by the earth towards
its centre. The force of attraction, which is
proportional to the mass of the particle, acts
vertically downwards and is known as weight of
the body. As the *distance between the different
particles of a body and the centre of the earth is
the same, therefore these forces may be taken to
act along parallel lines.

We have already discussed in Art. 4.6 that a
point may be found out in a body, through which

* — Strictly speaking, this distance is not the same.
But it is taken to the same, because of the very
small size of the body as compared to the earth.

Chapter 9 : Centre of Gravity m 163

the resultant of all such parallel forces act. This point, through which the whole weight of the body
acts, irrespect of its position, is known as centre of gravity (briefly written as C.G.). It may be noted
that every body has one and only one centre of gravity.

9.2. Centroid

The plane figures (like triangle, quadrilateral, circle etc.) have only areas, but no mass. The
centre of area of such figures is known as centroid. The method of finding out the centroid of a figure
is the same as that of finding out the centre of gravity of a body. In many books, the authors also write
centre of gravity for centroid and vice-versa.

9.3. Methods for Centre of Gravity

The centre of gravity (or centroid) may be found out by any one of the following two methods:
1. By geometrical considerations
2. By moments
3. By graphical method

As a matter of fact, the graphical method is a tedious and cumbersome method for finding out the
centre of gravity of simple figures. That is why, it has academic value only. But in this book, we shall
discuss the procedure for finding out the centre of gravity of simple figures by geometrical consider-
ations and by moments one by ones.

9.4. Centre of Gravity by Geometrical Considerations

The centre of gravity of simple figures may be found out from the geometry of the figure as given
below.

1. The centre of gravity of uniform rod is at its middle point.

Fig. 9.1. Rectangle Fig. 9.2. Triangle

2. The centre of gravity of a rectangle (or a parallelogram) is at the point, where its diagonals
meet each other. It is also a middle point of the length as well as the breadth of the rect-
angle as shown in Fig. 9.1.

3. The centre of gravity of a triangle is at the point, where the three medians (a median is a
line connecting the vertex and middle point of the opposite side) of the triangle meet as
shown in Fig. 9.2.

9.5. Centre of Gravity by Moments

The centre of gravity of a body may also be found out by moments as discussed below:

Fig. 9.9. Centre of gravity by moments

Consider a body of mass M whose centre of gravity is required to be found out. Divide the body
into small masses, whose centres of gravity are known as shown in Fig. 9.9. Let m,, m,, m,....; etc. be
the masses of the particles and (x,, y,), (>, Vy), Hy, V3), eee be the co-ordinates of the centres of
gravity from a fixed point O as shown in Fig. 9.9.

moments, we know that

9.6. Axis of Reference

The centre of gravity of a body is always calculated with reference to some assumed axis known
as axis of reference (or sometimes with reference to some point of reference). The axis of reference,
of plane figures, is generally taken as the lowest line of the figure for calculating ¥ and the left line of
the figure for calculating x .

9.7. Centre of Gravity of Plane Figures

The plane geometrical figures (such as T-section, /-section, L-section etc.) have only areas but no
mass. The centre of gravity of such figures is found out in the same way as that of solid bodies. The
centre of area of such figures is known as centroid, and coincides with the centre of gravity of the
figure. It is a common practice to use centre of gravity for centroid and vice versa.

Note. While using the above formula, Xys Xqy Hy vee OF Vy, Yor V3 OF X and y must be measured from the

same axis of reference (or point of reference) and on the same side of it. However, if the figure is on both sides
of the axis of reference, then the distances in one direction are taken as positive and those in the opposite
directions must be taken as negative.

9.8. Centre of Gravity of Symmetrical Sections

Sometimes, the given section, whose centre of gravity is required to be found out, is symmetrical
about X-X axis or Y-Y axis. In such cases, the procedure for calculating the centre of gravity of the
body is very much simplified; as we have only to calculate either x or y. This is due to the reason

that the centre of gravity of the body will lie on the axis of symmetry.

Example 9.1. Find the centre of gravity of a 100 mm x 150 mm x 30 mm T-section.

So.uTIon. As the section is symmetrical about Y-Y axis, bisecting the web, therefore its
centre of gravity will lie on this axis. Split up the section into two rectangles ABCH and DEFG as

9.10. Centre of Gravity of Solid Bodies

The centre of gravity of solid bodies (such as hemispheres, cylinders, right circular solid cones
etc.) is found out in the same way as that of plane figures. The only difference, between the plane
figures and solid bodies, is that in the case of solid bodies, we calculate volumes instead of areas. The
volumes of few solid bodies are given below :

1. Volume of cylinder =txrxh

2. Volume of hemisphere = 2m xr

3. Volume of right circular solid cone = ; xr xh
where r = Radius of the body, and

h = Height of the body.
Note. Sometimes the densities of the two solids are different. In such a case, we calculate the weights
instead of volumes and the centre of gravity of the body is found out as usual.

EXAMPLE 9.7. A solid body formed by joining the base of a right circular cone of height H
to the equal base of a right circular cylinder of height h. Calculate the distance of the centre of
mass of the solid from its plane face, when H = 120 mm and h = 30 mm.

So.uTion. As the body is symmetrical about the vertical axis, therefore its centre of gravity will
lie on this axis as shown in Fig. 9.17. Let r be the radius of the cylinder base in cm. Now let base of

Dividing both sides by 0.0873,
h* — 78.67 h? = —2 399 200 (i)

We shall solve this equation by trial and error. First of all, let us substitute h = 10 mm in the left
hand side of equation (i). We find

(10)* — 78.67 (10)? = — 68 670

We find that answer obtained does not tally with the value of right hand side of equation (i), and

is much less than that. Now let us substitute / = 20 mm in the left hand side of equation (i),
(20)* — 78.67 (20)? = — 469 360

We again find that the answer obtained does not tally with the right hand side of equation (7), But
it is closer to the value of right hand side than the first case (i.e. when we substituted / = 10 mm.) Or
in other words, the value obtained is still less than the right hand side of equation (7). But the differ-
ence has reduced. Now let us substitute h = 30 mm in the left hand side of equation (1).

(30)* — 78.67 (30)? = 1 314 100

We again find the answer obtained does not tally with the right hand side of equation (7), But it is
more close to the right hand side than the previous case i.e. when we substituted = 20 mm. Now let
us substitute / = 40 mm in the left hand side of the equation (7).

(40)* — 78.67 (40)? = 2474900

Now we find that the answer obtained does not tally with the right hand side of equation (7). But
its value is more than the right hand side of equation (i), In the previous cases, the value of the answer
obtained was less. Thus we find that the value of (/) is less than 40 mm.

A little consideration will show, that as the value of the answer is slightly more than the right
hand side of equation (i). (as compared to the previous answers), the value of (/) is slightly less than
40 mm. Now let us substitude / = 39 mm in the left hand side of the equation (i).

(39)* — 78.67 (39)? = — 2 153 200

Now we find that the answer obtained is less than the right hand side of equation (i). Thus the
value of (A) is more than 39 mm. Or in other words it is within 39 and 40 mm. This is due to the reason
that when we substitude 4 = 39 mm, the answer is less and when we substitute = 40 mm, answer is
more than the right hand side of equation (7), Now let us substitute h = 39.5 mm in the left hand side
of the equation (i).

(39.5)* — 78.67 (39.5)° = — 2 414 000

182 m Strength of Materials

Now we find that the answer obtained is more than the right hand side of equation (7). Thus the
value of (A) is less than 39.5 mm. Now let us substitute the 4 = 39.4 mm in the left hand side of
equation, (i).

(39.4)* — 78.67 (39.4)* = — 2 401 900

We find that is answer is very close to the right hand side of the equation and there is no need of

further calculations. Thus the value of h = 39.4 mm Ans.

Moment of
Inertia

10.1. Introduction

We have already discussed in Art. 3.2 that
the moment of a force (P) about a point, is the
product of the force and perpendicular distance
(x) between the point and the line of action of
the force (i.e. P.x). This moment is also called
first moment of force. If this moment is again
multiplied by the perpendicular distance (x)
between the point and the line of action of the
force i.e. P.x (x) = Px’, then this quantity is called
moment of the moment of a force or second
moment of force or moment of inertia (briefly
written as M.I.).

Sometimes, instead of force, area or mass
of a figure or body is taken into consideration.
Then the second moment is known as second

Chapter 10 : Moment of Inertia = 185

moment of area or second moment of mass. But all such second moments are broadly termed as
moment of inertia. In this chapter, we shall discuss the moment of inertia of plane areas only.

10.2. Moment of Inertia of a Plane Area

Consider a plane area, whose moment of inertia is required to be found out. Split up the whole
area into a number of small elements.

Let Ay, Ags Ay = Areas of small elements, and

I} >) Tz .. = Corresponding distances of the elements from the line about
which the moment of inertia is required to be found out.
Now the moment of inertia of the area,

T= an + ax 1y + a3 ry +...
=Yar

10.3. Units of Moment of Inertia

As a matter of fact the units of moment of inertia of a plane area depend upon the units of
the area and the length. e.g.,
1. If area is in m? and the length is also in m, the moment of inertia is expressed in m4.

2. If area in mm? and the length is also in mm, then moment of inertia is expressed in mm‘.

10.4. Methods for Moment of Inertia

The moment of inertia of a plane area (or a body) may be found out by any one of the following
two methods :

1. By Routh’s rule 2. By Integration.

Note : The Routh’s Rule is used for finding the moment of inertia of a plane area or a body of uniform
thickness.

10.5. Moment of Inertia by Routh’s Rule

The Routh’s Rule states, if a body is symmetrical about three mutually perpendicular axes”,
then the moment of inertia, about any one axis passing through its centre of gravity is given by:

A(orM)xS
I= 3. ... (For a Square or Rectangular Lamina)
A(orM)x S$ . wo. .
I= a ... (For a Circular or Elliptical Lamina)
A(orM)xS :
I= 35 ... (For a Spherical Body)
where A = Area of the plane area

M = Mass of the body, and
S = Sum of the squares of the two semi-axis, other than the axis, about
which the moment of inertia is required to be found out.
Note : This method has only academic importance and is rarely used in the field of science and

technology these days. The reason for the same is that it is equally convenient to use the method of integration
for the moment of inertia of a body.

*  f.e., X-X axis, Y-Y axis and Z-Z axis.

10.6. Moment of Inertia by Integration

The moment of inertia of an area may also be found y
out by the method of integration as discussed below:
Consider a plane figure, whose moment of inertia is
required to be found out about X-X axis and Y-Y axis as
shown in Fig 10.1. Let us divide the whole area into a no.
of strips. Consider one of these strips. y
Let dA = Area of the strip
x = Distance of the centre of gravity of the Y xX
strip on X-X axis and x
y = Distance of the centre of gravity of the Y
strip on Y-Y axis. Fig. 10.1. Moment of inertia by

We know that the moment of inertia of the strip about integration.

Y-Y axis
=dA .x

Now the moment of inertia of the whole area may be found out by integrating above

equation. i.e.,
Tyy= dA .x?

Similarly [,,= dA. y?

In the following pages, we shall discuss the applications of this method for finding out the
moment of inertia of various cross-sections.

10.7. Moment of Inertia of a Rectangular Section

Consider a rectangular section ABCD as shown in Fig. 10.2 A
whose moment of inertia is required to be found out.
Let b = Width of the section and
d = Depth of the section.

Now consider a strip PQ of thickness dy parallel to X-X axis

and at a distance y from it as shown in the figure xX
Area of the strip

10.9. Theorem of Perpendicular Axis

It states, If I, and I, be the moments of inertia of a plane section about two perpendicular
axis meeting at O, the moment of inertia I,, about the axis Z-Z, perpendicular to the plane and
passing through the intersection of X-X and Y-Y is given by:

Taz, = Lyx + Ly
Proof :

Consider a small lamina (P) of area da having co-ordinates
as x and y along OX and OY two mutually perpendicular axes on
a plane section as shown in Fig. 10.4.

Now consider a plane OZ perpendicular to OX and OY.
Let (r) be the distance of the lamina (P) from Z-Z axis such that
OP =r.

From the geometry of the figure, we find that Fig. 10.4. Theorem of

We know that the moment of inertia of the lamina P about X-X axis,

It states, [f the moment of inertia of a plane area about an axis through its centre of gravity is
denoted by I., then moment of inertia of the area about any other axis AB, parallel to the first, and

Proof
Consider a strip of a circle, whose moment of inertia is
required to be found out about a line AB as shown in Fig. 10.7.
Let da = Area of the strip
y= Distance of the strip from the
centre of gravity the section and
h= Distance between centre of
gravity of the section and the

axis AB.
We know that moment of inertia of the whole section about Fig. 10.7. Theorem of parallel

10.16. Moment of Inertia of a Built-up Section

A built-up section consists of a number of sections such as rectangular sections, channel
sections, I-sections etc., A built-up section is generally made by symmetrically placing and then
fixing these section by welding or riveting. It will be interesting to know that a built-up section

behaves as one unit. The moment of inertia of such a section is found out by the following steps.
1. Find out the moment of inertia of the various sections about their respective centres of
gravity as usual.
2. Now transfer these moments of inertia about the required axis (say X-X axis or Y-Y axis)
by the Theorem of Parallel Axis.
Note. In most of the standard sections, their moments of inertia of about their respective centres of
gravity is generally given. However, if it is not given then we have to calculate it before transferring it to the
required axis.

Introduction

A frame may be defined as a structure,
made up of several bars, riveted or welded
together. these are made up of angle irons or
channel sections, and are called members of the
frame or framed structure. though these members
are welded or riveted together, at their joints, yet
for calculation purposes, the joints are assumed
to be hinged or pin-jointed the determination of
force in a frame is an important problem in
engineering- science, which can be solved by the
application of the principles of either statics or
graphics. in this chapter, we shall be using the
principles of statics for determining the forces in
frames.

Chapter 11 : Analysis of Perfect Frames (Analytical Method) m 209

11.2. Types of Frames

Though there are many types of frames, yet from the analysis point of view, the frames may be
classified into the following two groups:

1. Perfect frame. 2. Imperfect frame.

11.3. Perfect Frame

A perfect frame is that, which is made up of members just suf-
ficient to keep it in equilibrium, when loaded, without any change in
its shape.

The simplest perfect frame is a triangle, which contains three
members and three joints as shown in Fig. 11.1. It will be intersting to
know that if such a structure is loaded, its shape will not be distorted.
Thus, for three jointed frame, there should be three members to prevent
any distortion. It will be further noticed that if we want to increase a
joint, to a triangular frame, we require two members as shown by dot-
ted lines in Fig. 11.1. Thus we see that for every additional joint, to a Fig. 11.1. Perfect
triangular frame, two members are required. Frame.

The no. of members, in a perfect frame, may also be expressed by
the relation :

n= (2j-3)
n = No. of members, and
J = No. of joints.

11.4. Imperfect Frame

An imperfect frame is that which does not satisfy the equation :
n = (2j - 3)
Or in other words, it is a frame in which the no. of members are more or less than (2j — 3). The
imperfect frames may be further classified into the following two types :

1. Deficient frame. 2. Redundant frame.

11.5. Deficient Frame

A deficient frame is an imperfect frame, in which the no. of members are less than (27 — 3).

11.6. Redundant Frame

A redundant frame is an imperfect frame, in which the no. of members are more than (2j — 3).
In this chapter, we shall discuss only perfect frames.

11.7. Stress

When a body is acted upon by a force, the internal force which is transmitted through the body is
known as stress. Following two types of stress are important from the subject point of view :
1. Tensile stress. 2. Compressive stress.

11.8. Tensile Stress

pe{e ep CESS
(a) Tensile stress (b) Compressive stress
Fig. 11.2

210 m Strength of Materials

Sometimes, a body is pulled outwards by two equal and opposite forces and the body tends to
extend, as shown in Fig 11.2. (a). The stress induced is called tensile stress and corresponding force
is called tensile force.

11.9. Compressive Stress

Sometimes, a body is pushed inwards by two equal and opposite forces and the body tends to
shorten its length as shown in Fig. 11.2 (b). The stress induced is called compressive stress and the
corresponding force is called compressive force.

11.10. Assumptions for Forces in the Members of a Perfect Frame
Following assumptions are made, while finding out the forces in the members of a perfect

frame:

All the members are pin-jointed.

The frame is loaded only at the joints.

The frame is a perfect one.

FwYN >

The weight of the members, unless stated otherwise, is regarded as negligible in
comparison with the other external forces or loads acting on the truss.

The forces in the members of a perfect frame may be found out either by analytical method
or graphical method. But in this chapter, we shall discuss the analytical method only.

11.11. Analytical Methods for the Forces

The following two analytical methods for finding out the forces, in the members of a perfect
frame, are important from the subject point of view :

1. Method of joints. 2. Method of sections.

Fig. 11.3

In this method, each and every joint is treated as a free body in equilibrium as shown in Fig.
11.3 (a), (b), (c) and (d). The unknown forces are then determined by equilibrium equations viz.,
x V=Oand 2A =0.i.e., Sum of all the vertical forces and horizontal forces is equated to zero.
Notes: 1. The members of the frame may be named either by Bow’s methods or by the joints at their
ends.
2. While selecting the joint, for calculation work, care should be taken that at any instant, the
joint should not contain more than two members, in which the forces are unknown.

Chapter 11 : Analysis of Perfect Frames (Analytical Method) m= 211
11.13. Method of Sections (or Method of Moments)

This method is particularly convenient, when the forces in a few members of a frame are
required to be found out. In this method, a section line is passed through the member or members, in
which the forces are required to be found out as shown in Fig. 11.4 (a). A part of the structure, on any
one side of the section line, is then treated as a free body in equilibrium under the action of external
forces as shown in Fig. 11.4 (b) and (c).

The unknown forces are then found out by the application of equilibrium or the principles
of statics 7.e., 2 M=0.

Notes: 1. To start with, we have shown section line 1-1 cutting the members AB and BC. Now in order to find
out the forces in the member AC, section line 2-2 may be drawn.
2. While drawing a section line, care should always be taken not to cut more than three members, in
which the forces are unknown.

11.14. Force Table

Finally, the results are tabulated showing the members, magnitudes of forces and their
nature. Sometimes, tensile force is represented with a + ve sign and compressive force with a
— ve sign.

Note: The force table is generally prepared, when force in all the members of a truss are required to be
found out.

Exampce 11.1. The truss ABC shown in Fig. 11.5 has a span of 5 metres. It is carrying
a load of 10 KN at its apex.

212 «& Strength of Materials

SoLuTION. From the geometry of the truss, we find that the load of 10 kN is acting at a distance
1.25 m from the left hand support i.e., B and 3.75 m from C. Taking moments about B and equating

the same,
Rex 5 = 10x 1.25 = 12.5
Ro = 15 = 2.5 kN
and R, = 10—2.5 =7.5 kN

The example may be solved by the method of joints or by the method of sections. But we shall
solve it by both the methods.
Methods of Joints

First of all consider joint B. Let the “directions of the forces P,, and Pp, (or P,, and P.») be
assumed as shown in Fig 11.6 (a).

and now resolving the forces horizontally and equating the same,

Now consider the joint C. Let the *directions of the forces P Ac and Prac (or Poa and Pop) be

*

The idea, of assuming the direction of the force P,, to be downwards, is that the vertical component of
the force Pp, is zero. Therefore in order to bring the joint B in equilibrium, the direction of the force P,, must
be downwards, or in other words, the direction of the force P,, should be opposite to that of the reaction Rp. If,
however the direction of the force P.,, is assumed to be upwards, then resolving the forces vertically and equating
the same,

P,, sin 60° = —7.5 (Minus sign due to same direction of R, and P,,, )

-7.5  -75
Pap 8.66 kN
sin 60° 0.866

Minus sign means that the direction assumed is wrong. It should have been downwards instead of

upwards. Similarly, the idea of assuming the direction of the force Pz, to be towards right is that the horizontal
component of the reaction R,, is zero. Therefore in order to bring the joint B in equilibrium, the direction of the
force P,, must be towards right (because the direction of the horizontal component of the force P,, is towards
left).

consider equilibrium of the left part of the truss (because it is smaller than the right part). Let the

* For details, please refer to the foot note on last page.
** The moment of the force P,, about the joint C may be obtained in any one of the following two ways :

1. The vertical distance between the member AB and the joint C (i.e., AC in this case) is equal to
5 sin 60° m. Therefore moment about C is equal to P,, x 5 sin 60° kKN-m.

2. Resolve the force P,, vertically and horizontally at B. The moment of horizontal component about
C will be zero. The moment of vertical component (which is equal to P,, x sin 60°) is equal to
Pp X sin 60° X 5 = Py, x 5 sin 60° KN-m.

A truss, which is connected to a wall or a column at one end, and free at the other is known as

essential to start the work. But in the case of cantilever trusses, determination of support reaction is
not essential, as we can start the calculation work from the free end of the cantilever.

11.16. Structures With One End Hinged (or Pin-jointed) and
the Other Freely Supported on Rollers and Carrying
Horizontal Loads

Sometimes, a structure is hinged or pin-jointed at one end, and freely supported on rollers at
the other end. If such a truss carries vertical loads only, it does not present any special features. Such
a structure may be solved just as a simply supported structure.

But, if such a structure carries horizontal loads (with or without vertical loads) the support
reaction at the roller supported end will be normal to the support; where the support reaction at the
hinged end will consist of :

1. Vertical reaction, which may be found out, by substracting the vertical support reaction at

the roller supported end from the total vertical load.

2. Horizontal reaction, which may be found out, by algebraically adding all the horizontal

loads.

After finding out the reactions, the forces in members of the frame may be found out as usual.

11.17. Structures With One End Hinged (or Pin-Jointed) and the
other Freely Supported on Rollers and Carrying Inclined
Loads

We have already discussed in the last article that if a structure is hinged at one end, freely
supported on rollers at the other, and carries horizontal loads (with or without vertical loads), the
support reaction at the roller- supported end will be normal to the support. The same principle is used
for structures carrying inclined loads also. In such a case, the support reaction at the hinged end will
be the resultant of :

1. Vertical reaction, which may be found out by subtracting the vertical component of the

support reaction at the roller supported end from the total vertical loads.

2. Horizontal reaction, which may be found out algebraically by adding all the horizontal

loads.

So.ution. Since the truss is supported on rollers at P, therefore the reaction at this end will be
vertical (because of horizontal support). Moreover, it is hinged at Q, therefore the reaction at this end
will be the resultant of horizontal and vertical forces and inclined with the vertical.

11.18. Miscellaneous Structures

In the previous articles we have been analysing the regular frames subjected to vertical, hori-
zontal and inclined loads. We have been solving such examples by the methods of joints and sections.
But sometimes we come across irregular structures.

Such structures may be analysed in the same way as that for regular structures. The casual look
at such a structure, gives us a feeling that it is complicated problem. But a patient and thoughtful
procedure helps us in solving such problems. The following examples will illustrate this point.

loads.

So.uTion. The whole structure may be considered to consist of two cantilever trusses
supporting an intermediate truss. As a matter of fact, the two point loads acting at the intermediate
truss are transferred to the ends of the cantilever trusses.

Since the two cantilever trusses are symmetrical and the point loads on the intermediate truss
are also symmetrical, therefore each cantilever truss is subjected to a point load as shown in
Fig. 11.55 (a).

will happen as the force P,_, is zero and the vertical components of the forces P,_, and P, ; are also
zero. Moreover, the force P, ; will be equal to the force P,_, i.e., 2.309 KN (Compression). This will

Supported on Rollers and Carrying In the previous chapter, we have discussed

Inclined Loads. the analytical methods for determining the forces
in perfect frames. We have seen that the method
of joints involves a long process, whereas the
method of sections is a tedious one. Moreover,
there is a possibility of committing some
mathematical mistake, while finding out the
forces in the various members of truss. The
graphical method, for determining the forces in
the members of a perfect frame, is a simple and
comparatively fool-proof method. The graphical
solution of a frame is done in the following steps:

1. Construction of space diagram,

2. Construction of vector diagram and

3. Preparation of the table.

It means the construction of a diagram of the given frame to a suitable linear scale, alongwith
the loads it carries. The magnitude of support reactions is also found out and shown in the space
diagram. Now name the various members and forces according to Bow’s notations as shown in
Fig. 12.1 (a).

In the space diagram of the truss ABC shown in Fig. 12.1 (a), the members AB, BC and CA are
represented by SR (or RS), SQ (or QS) and PS (or SP) respectively. Similarly, load at C and reactions
at A and B are represented by PQ, RP and OR respectively.

Note: The reactions are generally found out by analytical method as discussed in the last
chapter.

12.3. Construction of Vector Diagram

After drawing the space diagram and naming the various members of the frame according to
Bow’s notations, as discussed in the last article, the next step is the construction of vector diagram. It
is done in the following steps :

1. Select a suitable point p and draw pq parallel to PQ (i.e., vertically downwards) and equal
to the load W at C to some suitable scale.

2. Now cut off qr parallel to QR (i.e., vertically upwards) equal to the reaction R, to the
scale.

3. Similarly, cut off rp parallel to RP (i.e., vertically upwards) equal to the reaction R,, to the
scale. Thus we see that in the space diagram, we started from P and returned to P after
going for P-Q-R-P (i.e., considering the loads and reactions only).

4. Now through p draw a line ps parallel to PS and throgh r draw rs parallel to RS, meeting the
first line at s as shown in Fig. 12.1 (b). Thus psrp is the vector diagram for the joint (A).

5. Similarly, draw the vector diagram qrsq for the joint (B) and pqsp is the vector diagram
for the joint (C) as shown in Fig. 12.1 (b).

Notes: 1. While drawing the vector diagram, for a joint, care should be taken that the joint under consideration
does not contain more than two members whose forces are unknown. if the joint, under consideration
contains more than two such members whose forces are unknown, then some other joint which does
not contain more than two unknown force members, should be considered for drawing the vector
diagram.

2. If at any stage (which normally does not arise in a perfect frame) the work of drawing the vector
diagram is held up at some joint, it will be then necessary to determine the force at such a
joint by some other method i.e., method of sections or method of joints.

Chapter 12 : Analysis of Perfect Frames (Graphical Method) m 255
12.4. Force Table

After drawing the vector diagram, the next step is to measure the various sides of the vector
diagram and tabulate the forces in the members of the frame. For the preparation of the table, we
require :

1. Magnitude of forces, and 2. Nature of forces.

12.5. Magnitude of Force

Measure all the sides of the vector diagram, whose lengths will give the forces in the
corresponding members of the frame to the scale e.g., the length ps of the vector diagram will give the
force in the member PS of the frame to the scale. Similarly, the length sr will give the force in the
member SR to the scale and so on as shown in Fig. 12.2. (b).

If any two points in the vector diagram coincide in the each other, then force in the member
represented by the two letters will be zero.

q

(a) Space diagram (b) Vector diagram
Fig. 12.2

12.6. Nature of Force
The nature of forces in the various members of a frame is determined by the following steps:

1. In the space diagram, go round a joint in a clockwise direction and note the order of the
two letters by which the members are named e.g., in Fig. 12.2 (a) the members at joint (A)
are RP, PS and SR. Similarly, the members at joint (B) are QR, RS and SQ. And the members
at joint (C) are PQ, QS and SP.

2. Now consider a joint of the space diagram and note the order of the letters of all the
members (as stated above). Move on the vector diagram in the order of the letters noted
on the space diagram.

3. Make the arrows on the members of the space diagram, near the joint, under consideration,
which should show the direction of movement on the vector diagram. Put another arrow in
the opposite direction on the other end of the member, so as to indicate the equilibrium of
the method under the action of the internal stress.

4. Similarly, go round all the joints and put arrows.

5. Since these arrows indicates the direction of the internal forces only, thus the direction of
the actual force in the member will be in opposite direction of the arrows, e.g., a member
with arrows pointing outwards i.e., towards the joints [as member PS and SQ of Fig. 12.2
(a)] will be in compression; whereas a member with arrow pointing inwards i.e., away from
the joints [as member SR in Fig. 12.2 (b)] will be in tension.

method. The values obtained by graphical method are taken to be correct, if they agree upto the first

decimal point with the values obtained by analytical method, e.g., 8.66 (Analytical) = 8.7 (graphical).
Similarly, 4.32 (Analytical) = 4.3 (graphical).

Now draw vector diagram as shown in Fig. 12.6 (b) and as discussed below :

1. Select some suitable point 1 and draw a vertical line 1-2 equal to 5 KN to some suitable
scale to represent the load 5 KN at C. Similarly, draw 2-3 equal to 6 KN to the scale to
represent the load 6 kN at D.

2. Now cut off 3-4 equal to 5 KN to the scale to represent the reaction R,. Thus 4-1 will
represent the reaction R, to the scale.

3. Now draw vector diagram for the joint A. For doing so through 1, draw 1-5 parallel to AC
and through 4, draw 4-5 parallel to AE meeting the first line at 5. Now 1-5-4-1 is the

12.7. Cantilever Trusses

We have already discussed that a truss which is connected to walls or columns etc., at one end,
and free at the other is known as a cantilever truss. In the previous articles, we have noticed that the
determination of the support reactions was absolutely necessary to draw a vector diagram.

But in the case of cantilever trusses, determination of support is not essential, as we can start
the construction of vector diagram from the free end. In fact this procedure, actually gives us the
reactions at the connected ends of the truss.

12.8. Structures with one end hinged (or Pin-jointed) and the other
freely supported on rollers and carrying horizontal loads

We have already discussed in Art 14.16 that sometimes a structure is hinged or pin-jointed at
one end and freely supported on rollers at the others end. If such a structure carries vertical loads only,
the problem does not present any special features. Such a problem may be solved just as a simply
supported structure.

But, if such a structure carries horizontal loads (with or without vertical loads) the support
reaction at the roller supported end will be normal to the support; whereas the support reaction at the
hinged end will consist of :

1. Vertical reaction, which may be found out by subtracting the vertical support reaction at

the roller supported end from the total vertical load.

2. Horizontal reaction, which may be found out by algebraically adding all the horizontal

loads. After finding out the reactions, the space and vector diagram may be drawn as
usual.

12.9. Structures with one end Hinged (or Pin-jointed) and the Other
Freely Supported on Rollers and Carrying Inclined Loads

We have already discussed in Art 14.8 that if a structure is hinged at one end, freely supported
on rollers at the other and carries inclined loads (with or without vertical loads), the support reaction
at the roller supported end will be normal to the support. The support reaction at the hinged end will
be the resultant of :

1. Vertical reaction, which may be found out by subtracting the vertical component of the
support reaction at the roller supported end from the total vertical load.

2. Horizontal reaction, which may be found out by algebraically adding all the horizontal
loads.

SoLuTION. Since the truss is supported on rollers at the right end, therefore the reaction at this
end will be vertical. Moreover, as the truss is hinged at the left end, therefore the reaction at this end
will be inclined with the vertical.

1. First of all draw the space diagram for the roof truss and name the various forces and

reactions according to Bow’s notations.

2. Compound all the forces together and assume them to act through the centre of gravity of

the forces, i.e., along the line of action of 2 KN force.

3. Produce the line of action of the resultant force (compound together as per item 2) to meet

the line of action of the roller support (which will be vertical due to support on rollers)
at O.

4. Join OA. From O cut off OM equal to the total compound load (i.e., 1 + 2 + 1 =4 KN)

according to some scale, along the line of action of the resultant load.

12.10. Frames with both ends fixed

Sometimes, a frame or a truss is fixed or built-in at its both ends. In such a case, the reactions
at both the supports can not be determined, unless some assumption is made. The assumptions usu-
ally made are :

1. The reactions are parallel to the direction of the loads and

2. Incase of inclined loads, the horizontal thrust is equally shared by the two reactions.

Generally, the first assumption is made and the reactions are determined as usual by taking
moments about one of the supports.

12.11. Method of Substitution

Sometimes work of drawing the vector diagram is held up, at a joint which contains more than
two unknown force members and it is no longer possible to proceed any further for the construction
of vector diagram. In such a situation, the forces are determined by some other method. Here we shall
discuss such cases and shall solve such problem by the method of substitution.

R, = Ry 2
= 800 N

First of all, draw the space diagram and name all the members according to Bow’s notations
and also name the joints as shown in Fig. 12.54 (a).

While drawing the vector diagram, it will be seen that the vector diagram can be drawn for
joint Nos. 1, 2 and 3 as usual. Now when we come to joint No. 4, we find that at this joint there are
three members (namely DP, PO and ON) in which the forces are unknown. So we cannot draw the
vector diagram for this joint.

Now, as an alternative attempt, we look to joint No. 5. We again find that there are also three
members (namely NO, OR and RK) in which the forces are unknown. So we can not draw the vector
diagram for this joint also. Thus we find that the work of drawing vector diagram is held up beyond

Chapter 12 : Analysis of Perfect Frames (Graphical Method) m= 283

joint No. 3. In such cases, we can proceed by the substitution of an imaginary member.

Now, consider (for the time being only) the members OP and PQ as removed and substitute an
imaginary member joining the joints 5 and 6 (as shown by the dotted line) as shown in Fig. 14.54. (a).
Now we find that this substitution reduces the unknown force members at joint 4, from three to two
(i.e., members DI and IN; assuming the letter J in place of P and O) and thus we can draw the vector
diagram for this joint (i.e., No. 4).

Fig. 12.54 (a)

Fig. 12.54 (b)

Now after drawing the vector diagram for joint 4, proceed to joint 6 at which there are only two
members (i.e., EQ and Q/) in which the forces are unknown. The vector diagram, at this joint will
give the forces in EQ by the side eg of the vector diagram.

After drawing vector diagram at joint 6 and determining the forces in EQ (i.e., eq) replace the
imaginary member by the original members PQ and PO and again draw vector diagram for the joint
No. 6 as shown in Fig. 14.54 (b). This will give the force in the member PO.

Now proceed to joint No. 5 as usual and complete the whole vector diagram as shown in Fig.
14.54 (b). Meausring the various sides of the vector diagram, the results are tabulated here :

13.1. Introduction

We see that whenever a horizontal beam is
loaded with vertical loads, sometimes, it bends
(i.e., deflects) due to the action of the loads. The
amount with which a beam bends, depends upon
the amount and type of the loads, length of the
beam, elasticity of the beam and type of the beam.
The scientific way of studying the deflection or
any other effect is to draw and analyse the shear
force or bending moment diagrams of a beam. In
general, the beams are classified as under:

1. Cantilever beam,
2. Simply supported beam,

Nore. In this chapter, we shall study the first three types of beams only.

13.2. Types of Loading

A beam may be subjected to either or in combination of the following types of loads:
1. Concentrated or point load,
2. Uniformly distributed load and

3. Uniformly varying load. ? |

13.3. Shear Force - :
a
seminars [tafe

The shear force (briefly written as
S.F) at the cross-section of a beam may
be defined as the unbalanced vertical |
force to the right or left of the section.

13.4. Bending Moment : a =
written as B.M.) at the cross-section of

a beam may be defined as the algebraic
sum of the moments of the forces, to the right or left of the section.

Shearing force

Nore. While calculating the shear force or bending moment at a section, the end reactions must also be consid-
ered alongwith other external loads.

13.5. Sign Conventions

We find different sign conventions in different books, regarding shear force and bending moment
at a section. But in this book the following sign conventions will be used, which are widely followed
and internationally recognised.

(a) Positive S.F. (b) Negative S.F. (c) Positive B.M. (d) Negative B.M.

Fig. 13.1

1. Shear Force. We know that as the shear force is the unbalanced vertical force, therefore it
tends to slide one portion of the beam, upwards or downwards with respect to the other. The shear
force is said to be positive, at a section, when the left hand portion tends to slide downwards or the
right hand portion tends to slide upwards shown in Fig. 13.1 (a). Or in other words, all the downward
forces to the left of the section cause positive shear and those acting upwards cause negative shear as
shown in Fig. 13.1 (a).

Similarly, the shear force, is said to be negative at a section when the left hand portion tends to
slide upwards or the right hand portion tends to slide downwards as shown in Fig. 13.1 (6). Or in
other words, all the upward forces to the left of the section cause negative shear and those acting
downwards cause positive shear as shown in Fig. 13.1 (db).

2. Bending Moment. At sections, where the bending moment, is such that it tends to bend the
beam at that point to a curvature having concavity at the top, as shown in Fig. 13.1 (c) is taken as

288 m Strength of Materials

positive. On the other hand, where the bending moment is such that it tends to bend the beam at that
point to a curvature having convexity at the top, 5
as shown in Fig. 13.1 (d) is taken as negative.
The positive bending moment is often called
sagging moment and negative as hogging
moment.

A little consideration will show that the
bending moment is said to be positive, at a section,
when it is acting in an anticlockwise direction to
the right and negative when acting in a clockwise
direction. On the other hand, the bending moment
is said to be negative when it is acting in a
clockwise direction to the left and positive when :
it is acting in an anticlockwise direction. Bending test of resin concrete

Norte. While calculating bending moment or shear force, at a section the beam will be assumed to be weightless.

13.6. Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams

The shear force and bending moment can be calculated numerically at any particular section. But
sometimes, we are interested to know the manner, in which these values vary, along the length of the
beam. This can be done by plotting the shear force or the bending moment as ordinate and the position
of the cross as abscissa. These diagrams are very useful, as they give a clear picture of the distribution
of shear force and bending moment all along the beam.

Norte. While drawing the shear force or bending moment diagrams, all the positive values are plotted above the
base line and negative values below it.

13.7. Relation between Loading, Shear Force and Bending Moment

The following relations between loading, shear force and bending moment at a point or between
any two sections of a beam are important from the subject point of view:

1. If there is a point load at a section on the beam, then the shear force suddenly changes (i.e., the
shear force line is vertical). But the bending moment remains the same.

2. Tf there is no load between two points, then the shear force does not change (i.e., shear force line
is horizontal). But the bending moment changes linearly (i.e., bending moment line is an in-
clined straight line).

3. If there is a uniformly distributed load between two points, then the shear force changes linearly
(i.e., shear force line is an inclined straight line). But the bending moment changes according to
the parabolic law. (i.e., bending moment line will be a parabola).

4. If there is a uniformly varying load between two points then the shear force changes according
to the parabolic law (i.e., shear force line will be a parabola). But the bending moment changes
according to the cubic law.

13.8. Cantilever with a Point Load at its Free End

Consider a *cantilever AB of length / and carrying a point load W at its free end B as shown in
Fig. 13.2 (a). We know that shear force at any section X, at a distance x from the free end, is equal to
the total unbalanced vertical force. i.e.,

Thus from the equation of shear force, we see that the shear force is constant and is equal to —- W
at all sections between B and A. And from the bending moment equation, we see that the bending
moment is zero at B (where x = 0) and increases by a straight line law to — WI; . at (where x = 1). Now
draw the shear force and bending moment diagrams as shown in Fig. 13.2 (b) and 13.2 (c) respectively.

Thus we see that the shear force at any section between A and C (i.e., up to the point just before
the load W) is constant and is equal to the unbalanced vertical force, i.e., + 0.5 W. Shear force at any
section between C and B (i.e., just after the load W) is also constant and is equal to the unbalanced
vertical force, i.e., — 0.5 W as shown in Fig. 13.12 (b).

We also see that the bending moment at A and B is zero. It increases by a straight line law and is
maximum at centre of beam, where shear force changes sign as shown in Fig. 13.12 (c).

13.15. Overhanging Beam

It is a simply supported beam which overhangs (i.e., extends in the form of a cantilever) from its
support.

For the purposes of shear force and bending moment diagrams, the overhanging beam is analysed
as a combination of a simply supported beam and a cantilever. An overhanging beam may overhang
on one side only or on both sides of the supports.

13.16. Point of Contraflexure

We have already discussed in the previous article that an overhanging beam is analysed as a
combination of simply supported beam and a cantilever. In the previous examples, we have seen that
the bending moment in a cantilever is negative, whereas that in a simply supported beam is positive.
It is thus obvious that in an overhanging beam, there will be a point, where the bending moment will
change sign from negative to positive or vice versa. Such a point, where the bending moment changes
sign, is known as a point of contraflexure.

Maximum bending moment

The maximum bending moment, positive or negative will occur at C or at B because the shear
force changes sign at both these points. But from the bending moment diagram, we see that the
maximum positive bending moment occurs at C and the maximum negative bending moment occurs
at B.

13.17. Load and Bending Moment Diagrams from a Shear Force

Diagram

Sometimes, instead of load diagram, a shear force diagram for a beam is given. In such cases, we

first draw the actual load diagram and then the bending moment diagram. The load diagram for the
beam may be easily drawn by keeping the following points in view:

1.

If there is a sudden increase or decrease (i.e., vertical line of the shear force diagram), it indi-
cates that there is either a point load or reaction (i.e., support) at that point.
If there is no increase or decrease in shear force diagram between any two points (i.e., the shear
force line is horizontal and consists of rectangle), it indicates that there is no loading between
the two points.
If the shear force line is an inclined straight line between any two points, it indicates that there
is a uniformly distributed load between the two points.
If the shear force line is a parabolic curve between any two points, it indicates that there is a
uniformly varying load between the two points.

After drawing the load diagram, for the beam the bending moment diagram may be drawn as usual.

ExampLe 13.20. The diagram shown in Fig. 13.42 is the shear force diagram in metric

units, for a beam, which rests on two supports, one being at the left hand end.

2 m intervals along the beam and (c) position of the second support. Also draw bending moment
diagram for the beam and indicate the position and magnitude of the maximum value on it.

SoLution. Given: Total length (/) = 18m; Shear force at A = 10 kN and shear force at D = 3 KN.
First of all, let us analyse the shear force diagram as discussed below:
1. AtA

We see that the shear force increases suddenly from 0 to 10 KN. Therefore there is a support
reaction of 10 KN at A.

2. Between Aand B

We see that the shear force diagram has an inclined straight line between A and B. Therefore the
beam is carrying a uniformly distributed load between A and B. We also see that there is a decrease of
10—5.5 =4.5 KN shear force in 6 m length of beam. Therefore the beam carries a uniformly distributed
load of 4.5/6 = 3/4 kN/m.

3. AtB

We see that the shear force has a sudden decrease of 5.5 + 1.5 = 7 KN. Thus there is a point load
of 7 KN at B.

4. Between B and C

We see that the shear force diagram has an inclined straight line between B and C. Therefore the
beam is carrying a uniformly distributed load between B and C. We also see that there is a decrease of
9 —1.5=7.5 KN shear force in 10 m length of beam. Therefore the beam carries a uniformly distributed
load of 7.5/10 = 3/4 kKN/m.

5. AtC

We see that the shear force has a sudden increase of 9 + 3 = 12 KN. Thus there is a support
reaction of 12 KN at C.

6. Between C and D

We see that the shear force diagram has a straight horizontal line between C and D. Therefore
there is no load between C and D.

7. AtD

We see that the shear force decreases suddenly from + 3 kN to 0. Therefore there is a point load
of 3 KN at D.

The load diagram is shown in Fig. 13.43 (b).
Bending Moment

Maximum bending moment

The maximum bending moment, positive or negative will occur at B (i.e.,6 m from A) and C (i.e.,
16 m from A) because the shear force changes sign at both the points. But from the bending moment
diagram, we see that maximum positive bending moment occurs at B and the maximum negative
bending moment at C. Now complete the diagram as shown in Fig. 13.43 (c).

So.ution. Given: Total length (L)= 7m; Shear force at A = 8 kN and shear force at D = 6 kN
First of all, let us analyse the shear force diagram as discussed below:
1. AtA

We see that the shear force increase suddenly from 0 to 8 kN. Therefore there is a support
reaction of 8 kN at A.

2. Between A and B

We see that shear force diagram has a straight horizontal line between A and B. Therefore there
is no load between A and B.

3. AtB

We see that the shear force has a sudden decrease of 8-3 =5 KN. Therefore there is a point load
of 5 kN at B.

4. Between B and C

We see that the shear force diagram has an inclined straight line between B and C. Therefore the
beam is carrying a uniformly distributed load between B and C. We also see that there is a decrease of
3 + 1=4 KN in 2 m length of the beam. Therefore the beam is carrying a uniformly distributed load
of 4/2 = 2 kN/m.

5. AtC

We see that the shear force has sudden decrease of 6 — 1 = 5 KN. Therefore there is a point load
of 5 kN at C.

6. Between C and D

We see that the shear force has a straight horizontal line between C and D. Therefore there is no
load between C and D.

7. AtD

We see that the shear force suddenly decreases from — 6 KN to 0. Therefore there is a section of
6 kN at D.

SotuTion. Given: Total span (L) = 8.5m; Shear force at A =— 3 kN and shear force at D =
+4kN

First of all, let us analyse the shear force diagram discussed below:
1. AtA

We see that the shear force decreases suddenly from 0 to 3 KN at A. Therefore there is a point
load of 3 KN at A.
2. Between Aand B

We see that the shear force diagram is a straight horizontal line between A and B. Therefore there
is no load between A and B.
3. AtB

We see that the shear force diagram has a sudden increase of 3 + 2.5 = 5.5 KN at B. Thus there is
a support reaction of 5.5 KN at B.
4. Between BandC

We see that the shear force diagram is an inclined straight line between B and C. Therefore the
beam is carrying a uniformly distributed load between B and C. We also see that there is a decrease of

2.5 + 3.5 =6 KN shear force in 6 m length of beam. Therefore the beam carries a uniformly distributed
load of 6/6 = 1 kKN/m.

Chapter 13 : Bending Moment and Shear Force m 327

Fig. 13.47

5. AtC

We see that the shear force diagram has a sudden increase of 3.5 + 4 = 7.5 KN. Thus there is a
support reaction of 7.5 kN at C.
6. Between C and D

We see that the shear force diagram is a straight horizontal line between C and D. Therefore there
is no load between C and D.
7. AtD

We see that the shear force decreases suddenly from + 4 kN to 0. Therefore there is a point load
of 4 kN at D.

The maximum bending moment, positive or negative will occur at B, M or C because shear force

13.18. Beams Subjected to a Moment

Sometimes, a beam is subjected to a clockwise or anticlockwise moment (or couple) at a section.
In such a case, the magnitude of the moment is considered while calculating the reactions. The bending
moment at the section of the couple changes suddenly in magnitude equal to that of the couple. This
may also be found out by calculating the bending moment separately with the help of both the reactions.
Since the bending moment does not involve any load, therefore the shear force does not change at the
section of couple.
Notes: 1. A clockwise moment (called positive moment) causes negative shear force over the beam and
positive bending moment at the section. Similarly, an anticlockwise moment (called negative moment) causes
positive shear force over the beam and negative bending moment at the section.

2. The bending moment will suddenly increase due to clockwise moment and decrease due to anticlockwise

moment at the point of its application when we move from left to right along the beam.

EXAMPLE 13.23. A simply supported beam of 5 m span is subjected to a clockwise moment
of 15 kN-m at a distance of 2 m from the left end as shown in Fig. 13.51.

SotuTion. Given: Span (/) =5 mand couple at C (uw) = 15 kN-m

We know that the tendency of the moment is to uplift the beam from its support A and to depress
it at its support B. It is thus obvious that the reaction at A will be downwards and that at B will be
upwards as shown in Fig. 13.52 (a).

Taking moments about ,
R,px5 =15 ...(Since the beam is subjected to moment only)

We know that maximum bending moment will occur either at E where shear force changes sign

13.19. Beams Subjected to Inclined Loads

In the previous articles, we have been discussing the cases, when the load used to act at right
angles to the axis of the beam. But in actual practice, there may be cases when a beam is subjected to
inclined loads. These inclined loads are resolved at right angles and along the axis of the beam. A
little consideration will show that the transverse components (i.e., components, which are resolved at
right angles to the axis of the beam) will cause shear force and bending moments. The axial components
(i.e., components, which are resolved along the axis of the beam) will cause thrust i.e., pulls or pushes
in the beam, depending upon its end position.

Chapter 13 : Bending Moment and Shear Force m 335

In such cases, one end of the beam is hinged, whereas the other is simply supported or supported
on rollers. The hinged end will be subjected to horizontal thrust equal to the unbalanced horizontal
force of the axial components of the inclined loads. In such cases, like shear force and bending
moment diagrams, an axial force diagram is drawn, which represents the horizontal thrust. The general
practice, to draw the axial force diagram is that the tensile force is taken as positive, whereas the
compressive force as negative.

Beams

In the previous articles, we have discussed the cases of horizontal beams, subjected to various
types of loadings. But sometimes, we come across inclined beams or members (such as ladders etc.)
and carrying vertical loads. In such cases, the given loads are resolved at right angles and along the
axis of the beam. The beam is further analysed in the same manner as a beam is subjected to inclined
loads. The horizontal and vertical reactions at the two supports of the inclined beam are found out
from the simple laws of statics.

We have already discussed in Chapter 13 that
the bending moments and shearing forces are set
up at all sections of a beam, when it is loaded
with some external loads. We have also discussed
the methods of estimating the bending moments
and shear forces at various sections of the beams
and cantilevers.

As a matter of fact, the bending moment at a
section tends to bend or deflect the beam and the
internal stresses resist its bending. The process of
bending stops, when every cross-section sets up
full resistance to the bending moment. The
*resistance, offered by the internal stresses, to the

* The resistance offered by the internal stresses
to the shear force is called shearing stresses. It
will be discussed in the next chapter.

Chapter 14 : Bending Stresses in Simple Beams m 345

bending, is called bending stress, and the relevant theory is called the theory of simple bending.

14.2. Assumptions in the Theory of Simple Bending
The following assumptions are made in the theory of simple bending:

1. The material of the beam is perfectly homogeneous (i.e., of the same kind throughout) and
isotropic (i.e., of equal elastic properties in all directions).

The beam material is stressed within its elastic limit and thus, obeys Hooke’s law.

The transverse sections, which were plane before bending, remains plane after bending also.
Each layer of the beam is free to expand or contract, independently, of the layer above or below it.
The value of E (Young’s modulus of elasticity) is the same in tension and compression.

Aw PRY DN

The beam is in equilibrium i.e., there is no resultant pull or push in the beam section.

14.3. Theory of Simple Bending

Consider a small length of a simply supported beam subjected to a bending moment as shown in
Fig. 14.1 (a). Now consider two sections AB and CD, which are normal to the axis of the beam RS.
Due to action of the bending moment, the beam as a whole will bend as shown in Fig. 14.1 ().

Since we are considering a small length of dx of the beam, therefore the curvature of the beam in
this length, is taken to be circular. A little consideration will show that all the layers of the beam,
which were originally of the same length do not remain of the same length any more. The top layer of
the beam has suffered compression and reduced to A’C’. As we proceed towards the lower layers of
the beam, we find that the layers have no doubt suffered compression, but to lesser degree; until we
come across the layer RS, which has suffered no change in its length, though bent into R’S’. If we
further proceed towards the lower layers, we find the layers have suffered tension, as a result of which
the layers are stretched. The amount of extension increases as we proceed lower, until we come
across the lowermost layer BD which has been stretched to B’ D’.

(a) Before bending (b) After bending

Fig. 14.1. Simple bending
Now we see that the layers above have been compressed and those below RS have been stretched.
The amount, by which layer is compressed or stretched, depends upon the position of the layer with
reference to RS. This layer RS, which is neither compressed nor stretched, is known as neutral plane
or neutral layer. This theory of bending is called theory of simple bending.

Consider a small length dx of a beam subjected to a bending moment as shown in Fig. 14.2 (a).
As a result of this moment, let this small length of beam bend into an arc of a circle with O as centre

Now consider a layer PQ at a distance y from RS the neutral axis of the beam. Let this layer be

We know that decrease in length of this layer,

14.5. Position of Neutral Axis

The line of intersection of the neutral layer, with any normal cross-section of a beam, is known as
neutral axis of that section. We have seen in Art. 14.2 that on one side of the neutral axis there are
compressive stresses, whereas on the other there are tensile stresses. At the neutral axis, there is no
stress of any kind.

Consider a section of the beam as shown in Fig. 14.5. Let be the
neutral axis of the section. Consider a small layer PQ of the beam section

Since the section is in equilibrium, therefore total stress, from top to bottom, must be equal to zero.

A little consideration will show that y x 6 a is the moment of the area about the neutral axis and
x y x bais the moment of the entire area of the cross-section about the neutral axis. It is thus obvious
that the neutral axis of the section will be so located that moment of the entire area about the axis is

Chapter 14 : Bending Stresses in Simple Beams m 349

zero. We know that the moment of any area about an axis passing through its central axis of a section
always passes through its centroid. Thus to locate the neutral axis of a section, first find out the
centroid of the section and then draw a line passing through this centroid and normal to the plane of
bending. This line will be the neutral axis of the section.

We have already seen in Art. 14.2 that on one side of the neutral axis there are compressive
stresses and on the other there are tensile stresses. These stresses form a couple, whose moment must
be equal to the external moment (MV). The moment of this couple, which resists the external bending
moment, is known as moment of resistance.

Consider a section of the beam as shown in Fig. 14.6. Let NA be the
neutral axis of the section. Now consider a small layer PQ of the beam section
at a distance y from the neutral axis as shown in Fig. 14.6.

Let da = Area of the layer PQ.

We have seen in Art. 14.4 that the intensity of stress in the layer PQ,

14.7. Distribution of Bending Stress across the Section

We have seen in the previous articles that there is no stress at the neutral axis. In a *simply
supported beam, there is a compressive stress above the neutral axis and a tensile stress below it.

* In a cantilever, there is a tensile stress above the neutral axis and compressive stress below it.

350 om Strength of Materials

We have also discussed that the stress at a point is directly proportional to its distance from the
neutral axis. If we plot the stresses in a simply supported beam section, we shall get a figure as shown
in Fig. 14.7.

ho, ke
Fig. 14.7. Distribution of Bending Stress
The maximum stress (either compressive or tensile) takes place at the outermost layer. Or in

other words, while obtaining maximum bending stress at a section, the value of y is taken as
maximum.

We have already discussed in the previous article, the relation for finding out the bending stress
on the extreme fibre of a section, i.e.,

M = o or M=o0xX L
I y y
From this relation, we find that the stress in a fibre is proportional to its distance from the c.g. If

Ymax 18 the distance between the c.g. of the section and the extreme fibre of the stress, then

where Z = ——. The term ‘Z’ is known as modulus of section or section modulus. The general

practice of writing the above equation is M = 0 x Z, where o denotes the maximum stress, tensile or
compressive in nature.

We know that if the section of a beam to, is symmetrical, its centre of gravity and hence the
neutral axis will lie at the middle of its depth. We shall now consider the modulus of section of the
following sections:

1. Rectangular section. 2. Circular section.

Note : If the given section is hollow, then the corresponding values for external and internal dimensions

It is also termed as flexural strength of a section, which means the moment of resistance offered
by it. We have already discussed the relations :

M fe}
—_—- = — or M=2xI and M=o0Z
It is thus obvious that the moment of resistance depends upon moment of inertia (or section
modulus) of the section. A little consideration will show that the moment of inertia of beam section

does not depend upon its cross-section area, but its disposition in relation to the neutral axis.

We know that in the case of a beam, subjected to transverse loading, the bending stress at a point
is directly proportional to its distance from the neutral axis. It is thus obvious that a larger area near
the neutral axis of a beam is uneconomical. This idea is put into practice, by providing beams of
section, where the flanges alone withstand almost all the bending stress.

Fig. 14.14. Symmetrical sections.
We know that in a symmetrical section (i.e., circular, square or rectangular), the centre of gravity
of the section lies at the geometrical centre of the section as shown in Fig. 14.14. Since the neutral

Chapter 14 : Bending Stresses in Simple Beams = 357

axis of a section passes through its centre of gravity, therefore neutral axis of a symmetrical section
passes through its geometrical centre. In such cases, the outermost layer or extreme fibre is at a
distance of d/2 from its geometrical centre, where d is the diameter (in a circular section) or depth (in
square or rectangular sections).

Note : In most or the cases, we are required to find the maximum bending stress in the section. We know that
the bending stress at a point, in a section is directly proportional to its distance from the neutral axis. Therefore,
maximum bending stress in a section will occur in the extreme fibre of the section.

15.1. Introduction

In the last chapter, we have discussed the
bending stresses in simple beams, and the
pattern in which these stresses vary along the
symmetrical sections. But sometimes we come
across beams of composite sections. And we
are required to study the pattern in which these
stresses vary along such sections.

15.2. Types of Composite Beams

Though there are many types of composite
beams that we come across, yet the following are
important from the subject point of view:

1. Beams of unsymmetrical sections
2. Beams of uniform strength
3. Flitched beams.

Chapter 15 : Bending Stresses in Composite Beams m 365

15.3. Beams of Unsymmetrical Sections

We have already discussed in the last chapter that in a symmetrical section, the distance of
extreme fibre from the c.g. of the section y = d/2. But this is not the case, in an unsymmetrical section
(L, I, T, etc.), since the neutral axis of such a section does not pass through the geometrical centre of
the section. In such cases, first the centre of gravity of the section is obtained as discussed in Chapter
6 and then the values of y, in the tension and compression sides, is studied. For obtaining the bending
stress in a beam, the bigger value of y (in tension or compression) is used in the equation. This will be
illustrated by the following examples.

Example 15.1. Two wooden planks 150 mm x 50 mm each are connected to form a T-
section of a beam. If a moment of 6.4 kN-m is applied around the horizontal neutral axis, induc-
ing tension below the neutral axis, find the bending stresses at both the extreme fibres of the
cross- section.

So.uTIoN. Given: Size of wooden planks = 150 mm x 50 mm and moment (M) = 6.4 kN-m = 6.4
x 10° N-mm.

Two planks forming the 7-section are shown in Fig. 15.1. First of all, let us find out the centre of
gravity of the beam section. We know that distance between the centre of gravity of the section and its
bottom face,

Distance between the centre of gravity of the section and the upper extreme fibre,
y, = 20-125=75 mm
and distance between the centre of gravity of the section and the lower extreme fibre,
y, = 125mm

If the maximum bending stress in the beam section is not to exceed 40 MPa, find the moment,

First of all, let us find out the centre of gravity of the beam section. We know that distance

Distance between centre of gravity of the section and the upper extreme fibre,

and distance between the centre of gravity of the section and the lower extreme fibre,
y, = 129mm

Therefore for maximum bending stress, we shal use the value of y equal to 171 mm (Z.e., greater
of the two values of y, and y.). We know that moment of inertia of the section passing through its

Now consider these tubes firmly joined together as shown in Fig. 15. 4 (b). We know that vertical
height of the equilateral triangle,
= AB sin 60° = 40 x 0.866 = 34.64 mm

Centre of gravity of the section will lie at a height of 34.64/3 = 11.5 mm from the base BC.
Thus distance between the centre of gravity of the section and upper extreme fibre,

y, = (34.64 — 11.55) + 20 = 43.09 mm
and distance between the centre of gravity of the section and the lower extreme fibre,
y, = 1.55 + 20 = 31.55 mm

Therefore for maximum bending stress, we shall use the value of y equal to 43.09 mm (i.e.,

If a similar I-section is welded on the top of it to form a symmetrical section, determine the

Calculate the moment of resistance of the cross-section, when subjected to a moment causing

SOLUTION. Given: Permissible stress in compression (6,.) = 100 MPa = 100 N/mm? and permissible
stress in tension (6,) = 140 MPa = 140 N/mm’.
Moment of resistance of the cross-section

First of all, let us find the centre of gravity of the section. We know that the distance between the
centre of gravity of the section and its bottom face,

(50 x 20) 90 + (70 x 15) 45 + (25 x 10)5

= 60x 20) + (70x15) + (25x10) = 0-2 mm

y, = 100-60.2 = 39.8 mm and y, = 60.2 mm

Thus for the purpose of calculating moment of resistance of the section, we shall take the value
of y equal to 60.2 mm (i.e., greater of the two values between y, and y,). We also know that moment
of inertia of the section about an axis through its c.g. and parallel to x-x axis,

3. Two beams are simply supported over the same span and have the same flexural strength. Com-
pare the weights of these two beams, if one of them is solid circular and the other hollow
circular with internal diameter half of the external diameter. (Ans. 1.28)

15.4. Beams of Uniform Strength

We have already discussed that in a simply supported beam, carrying a “uniformly distributed
load, the maximum bending moment will occur at its centre. It is thus obvious that the bending stress
is also maximum at the centre of the beam. As we proceed, from the centre of the beam towards the
supports, the bending moment decreases and hence the maximum stress developed is below the
permissible limit. It results in the wastage of material. This wastage is negligible in case of small
spans, but considerable in case of large spans.

The beams of large spans are designed in such a way that their cross-sectional area is decreased
towards the supports so that the maximum bending stress developed is equal to the allowable stress
(as is done at the centre of the beam). Such a beam, in which bending stress developed is constant and
is equal to the allowable stress at every section is called a beam of uniform strength. The section of a
beam of uniform strength may be varied in the following ways:

1. By keeping the width uniform and varying the depth.
2. By keeping the depth uniform and varying the width.
3. By varying both width and depth.

The most common way of keeping the beam of uniform strength is by keeping the width uniform
and varying the depth.

EXAMPLE 15.7. A simply supported beam of 2.4 meters span has a constant width of 100
mm throughout its length with varying depth of 150 mm at the centre to minimum at the ends as
shown in Fig. 15.10. The beam is carrying a point load W at its mid-point.

* This is the most practical case. However, if a beam is carrying some other type loading, the maximum
bending moment will occur, at a point, near its centre.

15.5 Beams of Composite Section (Flitched Beams)

A composite section may be defined as a section made up of two or more different materials,
joined together in such a manner that they behave like a single piece and, each material bends to the
same radius of curvature. Such beams are used when a beam of one material, if used alone, requires
quite a large cross-sectional area; which does not suit the space available. A material is then reinforced
with some other material, of higher strength, in order to reduce the cross-sectional area of the beam
and to suit the space available (as is done in the case of reinforced cement concrete beams).

In such cases, the total moment of resistance will be equal to the sum of the moments of individual
sections.

Consider a beam of a composite section made up of two different materials as shown in Fig. 15.12.

M, = 0,xZ, (. M=0xZ)
Similarly, M, = 0,xZ,

Total moment of resistance of the composite section,

M = M,+M,=(0, x Z,) + (0, x Z,) (7D)

We also know that at any distance from the neutral axis, the strain in both the materials will be the
same.

From the above two relations, we can find out the total moment of resistance of a composite
beam or stresses in the two materials. But, if the sections of both the materials are not symmetrical,
then one area of the components is converted into an equivalent area of the other.

Similarly, Mg = 6.x Z,= 100 x (100 x 10°) = 10 x 10° N-mm
Total moment of resistance of the beam,
M = M,+M,=(4x 10°) + (10 x 10°) = 14 x 10° N-mm

ExampLe 15.10. A timber beam 100 mm wide and 200 mm deep is strengthened by a steel
plate 100 mm wide and 100 mm thick, screwed at the bottom surface of the timber beam as shown
in Fig. 15.14.

Fig. 15.14

Calculate the moment of resistance of the beam, if the safe stresses in timber and steel are 10
MPa and 150 MPa respectively. Take E, = 20 E,.

SoLuTION. Given: Width of timber section (b,;) = 100 mm ; Depth of timber section (d,) = 200
mm ; Safe stress in timber (o,) = 10 MPa = 10 N/mm? ; Width of steel section (b,) = 100
mm ; Depth of steel section (d;) = 10 mm ; Safe stress in steel (0;) = 150 MPa = 150 N/mm’ and
modulus of elasticity for steel (E,) = 20 E>.

We know that stress in steel is m times (20 times in this case) the stress in timber at the same
level. Hence the resistance offered by the steel is also equal to m times the resistance offered by the
timber of an equal area. It is thus obvious that if we replace steel by timber (or vice versa) of an area
equal to m times the area of the steel, the total resistance to bending offered will remain unchanged;
provided the distribution of the area about the neutral axis also remains unchanged. This can be done,
by keeping the depth of the area unchanged and by increasing the breadth of the timber m times the
breadth of the steel. The section thus obtained is called equivalent section and its moment of resistance
is equal to that of the given section.

In this case the equivalent section (of wood) is shown in Fig. 15.15. The bottom steel plate has

bottom face,

Therefore distance between the centre of gravity of the equivalent
steel section and the upper extreme fibre, 200 mm
y, = 210 -—57.5 = 152.5 mm

It is below the permissible stress (i.e., 75 N/mm’). Therefore moment of resistance of the steel

Therefore we shall take the value of y = 12.14 mm (i.e., greater of the two values among y,

16.1. Introduction

In the previous chapter, we discussed the
theory of simple bending. In this theory, we
assumed that no shear force is acting on the
section. But in actual practice when a beam is
loaded, the shear force at a section always comes
into play, alongwith the bending moment. It has
been observed that the effect of shearing stress,
as compared to the bending stress, is quite

sometimes, the shearing stress at a section assumes

its own importance.

Consider a small portion ABDC of length dx of a beam loaded with uniformly distributed
load as shown in Fig. 16.1 (a).

Fig. 16.1. Shearing stress

We know that when a beam is loaded with a uniformly distributed load, the shear force and
bending moment vary at every point along the length of the beam.

Let M = Bending moment at AB,

F = Shear force at AB,
F+dF = Shear force at CD, and

I = Moment of inertia of the section about its neutral axis.

Now consider an elementary strip at a distance y from the neutral axis as shown in Fig. 16.1 (b).
Now let o = Intensity of bending stress across AB at distance y from the neutral axis and

16.3. Distribution of Shearing Stress

In the previous article, we have obtained a relation, which helps us in determining the value of
shear stress at any section on a beam. Now in the succeeding articles, we shall study the distribution
of the shear stress along the depth of a beam. For doing so, we shall calculate the intensity of shear
stress at important sections of a beam and then sketch a shear stress diagram. Such a diagram helps us
in obtaining the value of shear stress at any section along the depth of the beam. In the following
pages, we shall discuss the distribution of shear stress over the following sections:

Triangular sections,

17.1. Introduction

We have already discussed in Chapter 2, that
whenever a body is subjected to an axial tension
or compression, a direct stress comes into play at
every section of the body. We also know that when-
ever a body is subjected to a bending moment a
bending stress comes into play. It is thus obvious
that if a member is subjected to an axial loading,
along with a transverse bending, a direct stress as
well as a bending stress comes into play. The
magnitude and nature of these stresses may be
easily found out from the magnitude and nature
of the load and the moment. A little consideration
will show that since both these stresses act nor-
mal to a cross-section, therefore the two stresses
may be algebraically added into a single resultant
stress.

17.2. Eccentric Loading

A load, whose line of action does not coincide with the axis of a column or a strut, is known as an
eccentric load. A bucket full of water, carried by a person in his hand, is an excellent example of an
eccentric load. A little consideration will show that the man will feel this load as more severe than the
same load, if he had carried the same bucket over his head. The simple reason for the same is that if
he carries the bucket in his hand, then in addition to his carrying bucket, he has also to lean or bend on
the other side of the bucket, so as to counteract any possibility of his falling towards the bucket. Thus
we say that he is subjected to :

1. Direct load, due to the weight of bucket (including water) and
2. Moment due to eccentricity of the load.

Consider a column subjected to an eccentric loading. The eccentric load may be easily analysed as
shown in Fig. 17.1 and as discussed below :
1. The given load P, acting at an eccentricity of e, is shown in Fig. 17.1 (a).
2. Let us introduce, along the axis of the strut, two equal and opposite forces P as shown in Fig.
17.1 (b).
3. The forces thus acting, may be split up into three forces.
4. One of these forces will be acting along the axis of the strut. This force will cause a direct
stress as shown in Fig. 17.1 (c).
5. The other two forces will form a couple as shown in Fig. 17.1 (d). The moment of this
couple will be equal to P x e (This couple will cause a bending stress).

Note : A column may be of symmetrical or unsymmetrical section and subjected to an eccentric load, with
eccentricity about one of the axis or both the axes. In the succeeding pages, we shall discuss these cases
one by one.

The +ve or —ve sign will depend upon the position of the fibre with respect to the eccentric load.
A little consideration will show that the stress will be maximum at the corners B and C (because these
corners are near the load), whereas the stress will be minimum at the corners A and D (because these
comers are away from the load). The total stress along the width of the column will vary by a straight

Notes : From the above equations, we find that

1. If op is greater than o,, the stress throughout the section, will be of the same nature (i.e., compressive).

2. If 0 is equal to G,, even then the stress throughout the section will be of the same nature. The minimum

stress will be equal to zero, whereas the maximum stress will be equal to 2 x 6p.

3. If 6, is less than o,, then the stress will change its sign (partly compressive and partly tensile).

17.6. Unsymmetrical Columns with Eccentric Loading

In the previous articles, we have discussed the symmetrical column sections subjected to eccen-
tric loading. But in an unsymmetrical column, first c.g. and then moment of inertia of the section is
found out. After that the distances between the c.g. of the section and its corners are calculated. The
stresses on the corners are then found out as usual, by using the respective values of moment of inertia
and distance of the corner from the c.g. of the section.

Example 17.8. A hollow cylindrical shaft of 200 mm external diameter has got eccentric
bore of 140 mm diameter, such that the thickness varies from 20 mm at one end to 40 mm at the
other. Calculate the extreme stress intensities, if the shaft is subjected to a load of 400 KN along
the axis of the bore.

17.7. Limit of Eccentricity

We have seen in Art. 17.2 and 17.3, that when an eccentric load is acting on a column, it produces
direct stress as well as bending stress. On one side of the neutral axis there is a maximum stress (equal
to the sum of direct and bending stress) and on the other side of the neutral axis there is a minimum
stress (equal to direct stress minus bending stress). A little consideration will show that so long as the
bending stress remains less than the direct stress, the resultant stress is compressive. If the bending
stress is equal to the direct stress, then there will be a zero stress on one side. But if the bending stress
exceeds the direct stress, then there will be a tensile stress on one side. Though cement concrete can
take up a small tensile stress, yet it is desirable that no tensile stress should come into play.

We have seen that if the tensile stress is not to be permitted to come into play, then bending stress
should be less than the direct stress, or maximum, it may be equal to the direct stress, i.e.,

It means that for no tensile condition, the eccentricity e should be less than 4 or equal to

Now we shall discuss the limit for eccentricity in the following cases :

1. For a rectangular section,

2. For a hollow rectangular section,

3. For a circular section and

4. Fora hollow circular section.
(a) Limit of eccentricity for a rectangular section

It means that the load can be eccentric, on either side of the geometrical axes, by an amount equal
to d/6. Thus if the line of action of the load is within the middle third, as shown by the dotted area in
Fig. 17.15, then the stress will be compressive throughout.

18.1. Introduction

A dam* is constructed to store large quantity
of water, which is used for the purposes of
irrigation and power generation. Adam may be of
any cross-section, but the dams of trapezoidal
cross-section are very popular these days. A
retaining wall is generally constructed to retain
earth in hilly areas. Though there are many types
of dams, yet the following are important from the
subject point of view :

1. Rectangular dams.
2. Trapezoidal dams having water face vertical,

3. Trapezoidal dams having water face
inclined.

* A dam constructed with earth is called an earthen
dam; whereas a dam constructed with cement con-
crete is called a concrete dam or gravity dam.

Chapter 18 : Dams and Retaining Walls m 423

We shall discuss the above three types of dams one by one.

18.2. Rectangular Dams
Consider a unit length of a rectangular dam, retaining water on one of its vertical sides as
shown in Fig. 18.1.
Let b = Width of the dam,
H = Height of he dam,
p = Specific weight of the dam masonry
h
w = *Specific weight of the water

Height of water reatined by the dam, and

Weight of dam per unit length,
W =9-b-H
This weight will act through centre of gravity of the dam section.
We know that the intensity of water pressure will be zero at the water surface and will **increase
by a straight line law to wh at the bottom. Thus the average intensity of water pressure on the face of
the dam

* Unless mentioned, otherwise, the specific weight of the water is taken as 9.8 kN/m’*.

** Sometimes, the dam is subjected to two kinds of liquids (e.g., some insoluble oil over water). In such a
case, the pressure diagram will be zero at the top and will increase by a straight line law to (w,h,) up to
the depth of oil. It will further increase by a straight line law to (w,h, + w,h,) at the bottom of the water;
where w,, w, and h,, h, are the specific weights and heights of the oil and water respectively. The total
pressure on the dam may be found out as usual.

This water pressure acts at a height of h/3 from the bottom of the dam as shown in Fig. 18.1. Now
with P and W as adjacent sides complete the parallelogram. The resultant of water pressure (P) and
weight of the dam (W) will be given by the relation,

R= Jp?+w ...(iii)
Let x be the horizontal distance between the centre of gravity of the dam and the point through

which the resultant R cuts the base (i.e., the distance JK in Fig. 18.1). From similar triangles LVM and

A little consideration will show that as a result of the eccentricity, some moment will come into
play, which will cause some bending stress at the base section of the dam. The magnitude of this

resultant R (of the water pressure P and the weight of dam W) cuts the base. The position of this point
helps us in finding out the total stresses across the base, at toe and heel of the dam. Apart from finding
out the total stresses, this point helps us in checking the stability of the dam. In general, a dam is
checked for the following conditions of stability:

1. To avoid tension in the masonry at the base of the dam,
2. To safeguard the dam from overturning,
3. To prevent the sliding of dam and
4. To prevent the crushing of masonry at the base of the dam.
Now we shall discuss all the above conditions of stability one by one.

18.6. Conditions to Avoid Tension in the Masonry of the Dam at its
Base

We have discussed in Art. 18.2. that the water pressure acting on one side of the dam, produces
bending stress; whereas the weight of the dam produces direct stress at the bottom of the dam. We
have also seen that on one side of the dam, there is a maximum stress (equal to sum of the direct and
bending stress); whereas on other side of the dam, there is a minimum stress (equal to direct stress
minus bending stress). A little consideration will show that so long as the bending stress remains less


Chapter 18 : Dams and Retaining Walls m 439

than the direct stress, the resultant stress is compressive. But when the bending stress is equal to the

direct stress, there will be zero stress on one side. But when the bending stress exceeds the direct

stress, there will be a tensile stress on one side. Though cement concrete can take up a small amount

of tensile stress, yet it is desirable to avoid tension in the masonry of the dam at its base.

It is thus obvious, that in order to avoid the tension in the masonry of the dam at its base, the
bending stress should be less than the direct stress or it may be equal to the direct stress, i.e.,

o, <

6W-e

or e

lA lA
als >|= BS

It means that the eccentricity of the resultant can be equal to b/6 on either side of geometrical axis
of base section. Thus the resultant must lie within the middle third of the base width in order to avoid
tension.

18.7. Condition to Prevent Overturning of the Dam

We have already discussed that when a dam is retaining water, it is subjected to some water
pressure. We can easily find out the resultant R of the water pressure P and the weight of dam W. Since
the dam is in equilibrium, therefore the resultant R must be balanced by equal and opposite reaction
acting at K. This reaction may be split up into two components viz., horizontal and vertical. The
horizontal component must be equal to the water pressure P, whereas the vertical component must be
equal to the weight W. Thus the following four forces acting on the dam, keep it in equilibrium:

1. Water pressure P,

2. Horizontal component of the reaction,
3. Weight of the dam W and

4. Vertical component of the reaction.

These four forces may be grouped into two sets or couples. The moment of a couple consisting of
the first two forces,
M, = Force x Arm = Pxi ..(1)
Similarly, moment of a couple consisting of the last two forces,
M, = WxJK (ii)
A little consideration will show that the moment of the first two forces will tend to overturn the
dam about B; whereas the moment of the last two forces will tend to restore the dam. Since the dam is
in equilibrium and a couple can only be balanced by a couple, therefore overturning moment must be
equal to the restoring moment, i.e.,

px = WxJK
ik = ox!
or -— w3

Incidentally, this equation is the same which we derived in Art. 18.6 and gives the position of the
point K, where the resultant cuts the base. Since the dam will tend to overturn about B, therefore
balancing moment about B,

M, = WxJB

Now, we see that the dam is safe against overturning, so long as the balancing moment is more

than the overturning moment (or restoring moment, which is equal to overturning moment), i.e.,
WxJB > WxJK
or JB > JK

440 m® Strength of Materials

It is thus obvious that the condition to prevent the dam from overturning, is that the point K
should be between J and B or more precisely between A and B.

As a matter of fact, this is a superfluous condition. We know that to avoid tension in the masonry
of a dam at its bottom, the resultant must lie within the middle third of the base width. Since we have
to check the stability of a dam for tension in the base masonry, therefore the stability of the dam for
overturning is automatically checked.

18.8. Condition to Prevent the Sliding of Dam

We have already discussed in Art. 18.7 that there are four forces which act on a dam and keep it
in equilibrium. Out of these four forces, two are vertical and the following two are horizontal:

(a) Water pressure P and

(b) Horizontal component of the reaction.

A little consideration will show that the horizontal component of the reaction will be given by the
frictional force at the base of the dam.

Let tt = Coefficient of friction between the base of dam and the soil.

We know that the maximum available force of friction,

It is thus obvious that so long as F,,,, is more* than the water pressure P, the dam is safe against
sliding.

18.9. Condition to Prevent Crushing of Masonry at the Base of the
Dam

We have already discussed in Art. 18.2 that whenever a dam is retaining water, the masonry of
dam at its bottom is subjected to some stress. This stress varies from O,,,,, to 6,,,;, by a Straight line law.
A little consideration will show that the condition to prevent the crushing of masonry at the base of the
dam, is that the maximum stress ©,,,,, Should be less than the permissible stress in the masonry.

EXAMPLE 18.8. A masonry wall 5 metres high and 1.8 metre wide is containing water up to
a height of 4 metres. If the coefficient of friction | —1.8 m—|
between the wall and the soil is 0.6, check the D C

and water as 22 kN/m’ and 9.81 kN/m’.

Width of the wall (b) = 1.8 m; Height of the water (/)

the soil (u) = 0.6 and weight of masonry (p) =

resultant thrust (R) cuts the base,

AK = AJ+x=0.9+0.53 = 1.43 m

Since the resultant thrust lies beyond the middle third of the base width (i.e., from 0.6 to 1.2 m),
therefore the wall shall fail due to tension in its base. Ans.

2. Check for overturning.

Since the resultant thrust is passing within the base as obtained above, therefore the wall is safe
against overturning. Ans.

3. Check for sliding the wall.
We know that horizontal pressure due to water, (P) = 78.48 KN.
And the frictional force = UW = 0.6 x 198 = 118.8 kN
Since the frictional force (118.8 KN) is *more than the horizontal pressure (78.48 kN), therefore
the wall is safe against sliding. Ans.

18.10. Minimum Base Width of a Dam

We have already discussed in Arts. 18.6 to 18.9, the general conditions for the stability of a dam,
when the section is given. But sometimes, while designing a dam, we have to calculate its necessary
base width. This can be easily found out by studying the conditions for the stability of a dam. Thus the
base width (b) of a dam may be obtained from the following three conditions:

1. To avoid tension in the masonry at the base of the dam, the eccentricity (e) = 2.

Ww

In this case, the maximum stress 6, = =5 and the minimum stress 6,,,,,, = 0.

The stress diagram at the base will be a triangle.

2. To avoid the sliding of dam, the force of friction between the dam and soil, is at least 1.5 times
the total water pressure per metre length, i.e.,

LW

P = 15

3. To prevent the crushing of masonry at the base of the dam, the maximum stress should be less
than the permissible stress of the soil.

Note. If complete data of a dam is given, then the base width for all the above three conditions should be found
out separately. The maximum value of the base width from the above three conditions will give the
necessary base width of the dam. But sometimes, sufficient data is not given to find out the values of
base width for all the above mentioned three conditions. In such a case, the value of minimum base
width may be found out, for any one of the above three conditions.

18.12. Retaining Walls

We have already discussed in Art. 18.1 that a retaining wall is generally, constructed to retain
earth in hilly areas. The analysis of a retaining wall is, somewhat like a dam. The retaining wall is
subjected to pressure, produced by the retained earth in a similar manner, as the dam is subjected to
water pressure.

18.13. Earth Pressure on a Retaining Wall

It has been established since long that the earth particles lack in cohesion and hence have a
definite *angle of repose. These earth particles always exert some lateral pressure on the walls, which
retain or support them. The magnitude of this lateral pressure depends upon type of earth particles
and the manner, in which they have been deposited on the back of the retaining wall. It has been
experimentally found that the lateral pressure is minimum, when the earth particles have been loosely
dumped, whereas the pressure is relatively high, when the same particles have been compacted by
tamping or rolling. The earth pressures may be classified into the following two types:

1. Active earth pressure and 2. Passive earth pressure.

18.14. Active Earth Pressure

The pressure, exerted by the retained material called backfill, on the retaining wall is known as
active earth pressure. As a result of the active pressure, the retaining wall tends to slide away from the
retained earth. It has been observed that the active pressure of the retained earth, acts on the retaining
wall, in the same way as the pressure of the stored water on the dam.

* Tt may be defined as the maximum natural slope, at which the soil particles will rest due to their internal
friction, if left unsupported for a sufficient length of time.

450 m Strength of Materials

18.15. Passive Earth Pressure

Sometimes, the retaining wall moves laterally against the retained earth, which gets compressed.
As a result of the movement of the retaining wall, the compressed earth is subjected to a pressure
(which is in the opposite direction of the active pressure) known as passive earth pressure.

It may be noted that the active pressure is the practical pressure, which acts on the retaining
walls; whereas the passive earth pressure is a theoretical pressure, which rarely comes into play.

18.16. Theories for Active Earth Pressure

There are many theories and hypothesis for the active earth pressure, on the retaining walls. But
none of these gives the exact value of the active pressure. The following two theories are considered
to give a fairly reliable values:

1. Rankine’s theory and 2. Coulomb’s wedge theory.

18.17. *Rankine’s Theory for Active Earth Pressure

It is one of the most acceptable theories, for the determination of active earth pressure on the
retaining wall. This theory is based on the following assumptions:

K A B
Fig. 18.20
1. The retained material is homogeneous and cohesionless.

2. The back of the wall is smooth, i.e., the frictional resistance between the retaining wall and the
retained material is neglected.
3. The failure of the retained material takes place along a plane, called rupture plane.

Consider a trapezoidal retaining wall ABCD, retaining earth up to a height of h on its vertical
face AD. Let the retained earth be levelled with the top of the wall CD. Draw AE at an angle @ with AK
(where @ is the angle of repose of the retained earth). A little consideration will show that if retaining
wall is removed, the retained earth will be subjected to tension and will slide down along certain
plane, whose inclination will be more than that of the angle of repose with AK. Let such a plane AF be
inclined at an angle 0 with AK as shown in Fig. 18.20. Now consider a horizontal force P offered by
the retaining wall, which will keep the wedge AFD of the retained earth in equilibrium.

We see that, the wedge AFD of the retained earth is in equilibrium, under the action of the
following forces.**

* This theory was given by Prof. W.J. Rankine, a British Engineer in 1857.
** The frictional force, along the face AD of the retaining wall, is neglected.

A little consideration will show that if the retaining wall is removed, the retained earth will

immediately slide down across a plane, where the tendency for the material to slide down is greatest.
Let such a plane be AH. Therefore maximum value of the force P is required to retain the wedge AHD
of the earth. In order to locate the plane AH (i.e., the plane of rupture), differentiate the equation for
P and equal to zero i.e.,

18.18. *Coulomb’s Wedge Theory for Active Earth Pressure

In Rankine’s theory for active earth pressure, we considered the equilibrium of an element within
the mass of the retained material. But in this theory, the equilibrium of the whole material supported
by the retaining wall is considered, when the wall is at the point of slipping away from the retained
material.

This theory is based on the concept of sliding wedge, which is torn off from the backfill on the
movement of the wall and is based on the following assumptions:

1. The retained material is homogeneous and cohesionless.

2. The sliding wedge itself acts as a rigid body and the earth pressure is obtained by considering
the limiting equilibrium of the sliding wedge as a whole.

3. The position and direction of the earth pressure is known i.e., the pressure acts on the back of
the wall and at a height of one-third of the wall height from the base. The pressure is inclined at
an angle 6 (called the angle of wall friction) to the normal to the back.

Consider a trapezoidal retaining wall ABCD retaining surcharged earth up to a height of / on the
inclined face AD as shown in Fig. 18.25.

Fig. 18.25
Let h = Height of the wall,
w = Specific weight of the retained earth,

19.1. Introduction

We see that whenever a cantilever or a beam
is loaded, it deflects from its original position. The
amount, by which a beam deflects, depends upon
its cross-section and the bending moment. In
modern design offices, following are the two
design criteria for the deflection of a cantilever or
a beam:

1. Strength 2. Stiffness.

As per the strength criterion of the beam
design, it should be strong enough to resist bending
moment and shear force. Or in other words, the
beam should be strong enough to resist the bending
stresses and shear stresses. And as per the stiffness
criterion of the beam design, which is equally
important, it should be stiff enough to resist the
deflection of the beam. Or in other words, the beam

464 & Strength of Materials

should be stiff enough not to deflect more than the permissible limit* under the action of the loading.
In actual practice, some specifications are always laid to limit the maximum deflection of a cantilever
or a beam to a small fraction of its span.

In this chapter, we shall discuss the slope and deflection of the centre line of beams under the
different types of loadings.

19.2. Curvature of the Bending Beam
Consider a beam AB subjected to a bending moment. As a result of loading, let the beam deflect
from ABC to ADB into a circular arc as shown in Fig. 19.1.

only i.e., the effect of shear force has been neglected. This is due to the reason that the effect of shear
force is extremely small as compared to the effect of bending moment.

2. In actual practice the beams bend into an arc of a circle only in a few cases. A little consideration will
show that a beam will bend to an arc of a circle only if (7) the beam is of uniform section and (ii) the
beam is subjected to a constant moment throughout its length or the beam is of uniform strength.

19.3. Relation between Slope, Deflection and Radius of Curvature
Consider a small portion PQ of a beam, bent into an arc as shown in Fig. 19.2.
Let ds = Length of the beam PQ,
R = Radius of the arc, into which the beam has been bent,
C = Centre of the arc,
= Angle, which the tangent at P makes with x-x axis and
‘~+d¥ = Angle which the tangent at Q makes with x-x axis.
From the geometry of the figure, we find that

ZPCQ = d¥
and ds = R.d¥
ds _ dx ar _
R= TP de ... (Considering ds = dx)

We know that if x and y be the co-ordinates of point P, then

Note. The above equation is also based only on the bending moment. The effect of shear force, being very small
as compared to the bending moment, is neglected.

19.4. Methods for Slope and Deflection at a Section
Though there are many methods to find out the slope and deflection at a section in a loaded
beam, yet the following two methods are important from the subject point of view:
1. Double integration method.
2. Macaulay’s method.
It will be interesting to know that the first method is suitable for a single load, whereas the second
method is suitable for several loads.

19.5. Double Integration Method for Slope and Deflection
We have already discussed in Art. 19.3 that the bending moment at a point,

Integrating the above equation,
EI o = [mu .. (i)
and integrating the above equation once again,
El.y = {fu .. (ii)

It is thus obvious that after first integration the original differential equation, we get the value of
slope at any point. On further integrating, we get the value of deflection at any point.
Nore. While integrating twice the original differential equation, we will get two constants C, and C,. The values
of these constants may be found out by using the end conditions.

19.10. Macaulay’s Method* for Slope and Deflection

We have seen in the previous articles and examples that the problems of deflections in beams are
bit tedious and laburious, specially when the beam is carrying some point loads. Mr. W.H. Macaulay
devised a method, a continuous expression, for bending moment and integrating it in such a way, that
the constants of integration are valid for all sections of the beam ; even though the law of bending
moment varies from section to section. Now we shall discuss the application of Macaulay’s method
for finding out the slopes and deflection of a few types of beams:

Notes. The following rules are observed while using Macaulay’s method:
1. Always take origin on the extreme left of the beam.
2. Take left clockwise moment as negative and left anticlockwise moment as positive.
3. While calculating the slopes and deflections, it is convenient to use the values first in terms of kN and
metres.

* This method was original proposed by Mr. A. Clebsch, which was further developed by Mr. W.H. Macaulay.

Thus we can express the bending moment, for all the sections of the beam in a single equation,

For any point in section AC, stop at the dotted line, and for any point in section CB add the

It is a beam made up of two or more different materials, joined together in such a manner, that
they behave like a single piece, and the deflection of each piece is equal.

The slope and deflection of such a beam, is found out by algebraically adding the flexural
rigidities of the two or more different materials, in the application of the respective relation.

21.1. Introduction

In the last chapters, we have discussed the
slope and deflection of various types of beams
and cantilevers. But the derivations of the
relations are difficult and lengthy. But in this
chapter, we shall discuss a graphical method for
the slope and deflection of beams and cantilevers.
This method is simple and enables us quicker
solutions. It is popularly known as moment area
method and is based on Mohr’s theorems which
are stated below:

21.2. Mohr’s Theorems

The deflection of beams and cantilevers by
moment area method is based on the following
two theorems, which were stated by Mohr.

510 m@ Strength of Materials

Mohr’s Theorem - I

It states, “The change of slope between any two points, on an elastic curve is equal to the net
area of B.M. diagram between these points divided by EI.”

20.1. Introduction

In the previous chapter, we have discussed
the slope and deflection of beams, subjected to
various types of loadings. The same formulae may
also be used for finding out the slope and
deflection of cantilevers.

20.2. Methods for Slope and
Deflection at a Section
Though there are many methods for the slope
and deflection at a section in a loaded cantilever,
yet the following are important from the subject
point of view:
1. Double integration method and

2. Moment area method.

the slope and deflection at any section of a beam. We shall use the same method for finding out the

that point due to various loads acting individually.

Fixed Beams

24.1. Introduction

A beam, which is built-in at its two supports,
is called a constrained beam or a fixed beam.
Since the beam is fixed at its two supports,
therefore the slope of the elastic curve of the
beam at its two ends, even after loading will be
zero. Thus, a fixed beam AB may be looked
upon as a simply supported beam, subjected to
end moments M, and M,, such that the slopes
at two supports are zero. A little consideration
will show that this is only possible, if the
magnitude and directions of the restraining
moments M, and M, are equal and opposite to
that of the bending moments under a given
system of loading.

Chapter 24 : Fixed Beams m 571
24.2. Advantages of Fixed Beams

A fixed beam has the following advantages over a simply supported beam:
1. The beam is stiffer, stronger and more stable.
The slope at both the ends is zero.

3. The fixing moments are developed at the two ends, whose effect is to reduce the maximum
bending moment at the centre of the beam.

4. The deflection of a beam, at its centre is very much reduced.

24.3. Bending Moment Diagram for Fixed Beams

Consider a fixed beam AB, of span / subjected to various types of loading as shown in Fig. 24.1
(a). Now we shall analyse the beam into the following two categories:
1. A simply supported beam AB subjected to vertical loads and reactions.
2. A simply supported beam AB subjected to end moments.

(4)

(@) 4, a

Fig. 24.1
The complete bending moment diagram may be drawn by superimposing the bending moment
diagrams for the above two cases. We know that the beam AB, when treated as a simply supported
beam carrying vertical loads and reactions will be subjected to positive bending moment (i.e., sag-
ging) as shown in Fig. 24.1 (b). But the beam AB, when treated as a simply supported beam, having
fixing moments M, and M, will be subjected to negative bending moment (i.e., hogging) as shown in

572 m Strength of Materials

Fig. 24.1 (c). Since the directions of the above two moments are opposite to each other, therefore
their resultant effect may be seen by drawing the two moments, on the same side of the base AB as
shown in Fig. 24.1(d).

Now consider any section X, at a distance x from A. Let the bending moment due to vertical
loading be pty. The bending moment due to fixing moments M, and M, at X,

My = -|M, +(M, -M,)>|
Total bending moment at X,

Notes: 1. The total bending moment at any section may be found out from the above relation, if the values of
M, and M, are known.
2. The shear force diagram for the beam may now be drawn as usual.

3. The portion of the beam AB, in which the net bending moment is sagging (i.e., positive) will bend
with concave upwards, whereas the portion of the beam, in which the net bending moment is hogging
(i.e., negative) will bend with convex upwards. The elastic curve of the beam may be drawn as usual
as shown in Fig. 24.1 (e).

esnpe: supports, is called a continuous beam. Such a
beam, when loaded will deflect with convexity
upwards, over the intermediate supports and with
concavity upwards over the mid of the spans. The
intermediate supports of a continuous beam are
always subjected to some bending moment. The
end supports, if simply supported will not be sub-
jected to any bending moment. But the end sup-
ports, if fixed, will be subjected to fixing moments
and the slope of the beam, at the fixed ends will
be zero.

25.2. Bending Moment Diagrams
for Continuous Beams

The analysis of a continuous beam is similar

Chapter 25 : Theorem of Three Moments m 599

to that of a fixed beam. The bending moment diagram for a continuous beam under any system of
loading may be drawn in the following two stages:
1. By considering the beam as a series of discontinuous beams, from support to support and drawing
the usual L-diagram due to vertical loads.
2. By superimposing the usual 1’-diagram, due to end moments over U-diagram.

25.3. Claypeyron’s Theorem of Three Moments

It states, “Ifa beam has n supports, the end ones being fixed, then the same number of equations
required to determine the support moments may be obtained from the consecutive pairs of spans i.e.,
AB-BC, BC-CD, CD-DE and so on.”

Proof:
Consider a continuous beam ABC, fixed at A and C and supported at B as shown in Fig. 25.1 (a).
Let 1, = Span of the beam,
I, = Moment of inertia of the beam in span AB,
L,, 1, = Corresponding values for the span BC,

M, = Support moment at A,

M, = Support moment at B,

Mc. = Support moment at C,

25.4. Application of Clapeyron’s Theorem of Three Moments to
Various Types of Continuous Beams
We have already studied in Art. 25.3 the Clapeyron’s theorem of three moments. Now we shall

discuss its application to the following types of continuous beams:

1. Continuous beams with simply supported ends,

2. Continuous beams with fixed end supports,

3. Continuous beams with the end span overhanging and

4. Continuous beams with a sinking support.

25.5. Continuous Beams with Simply Supported Ends
Sometimes, a continuous beam is simply supported on its one or both the end supports. In such a
case, the fixing moment on the simply supported end is zero.

25.6. Continuous Beams with Fixed End Supports

Sometimes, a continuous beam is fixed at its one or both ends. If the beam is fixed at the left end
A, then an imaginary zero span is taken to the left of A and the three moments theorem is applied as
usual. Similarly, if the beam is fixed at the right end, then an imaginary zero span is taken after the
right end support and the three moments theorem is applied as usual.
Notes. 1. The fixing moment, at the imaginary support of the zero span i.e., M, is always equal to zero.
2. Propped cantilevers and beams may also be analyses by Clapeyron’s theorem of three moments.
EXAMPLE 25.3. A continuous beam ABC of uniform section, with span AB as 8 m and BC as
6 m, is fixed at A and simply supported at B and C. The beam is carrying a uniformly distributed
load of 1 kN/m throughout its length. Find the moments along the beam and the reactions at the

25.7. Continuous Beams with End Span Overhanging

Sometimes, a continuous beam is overhanging, at its one or both ends. In such a case, the over-
hanging part of the beam behaves like a cantilever. The fixing moments on the end support may be
found out by the cantilever action of the overhanging part of the beam.

EXxamPLe 25.5. A beam ABCD 9 m long is simply supported at A, B and C, such that the
length AB is 3 m, length BC is 4.5 m and the overhung CD is 1.5 m. It carries a uniformly
distributed load of 1.5 kN/m in span AB and a point load of I KN at the free end D. The moments
of inertia of the beam in span AB and CD is I and that in the span BC is 21. Draw the bending
moment and shear force diagrams for the beam.

So.uTIon. Given : Length AB (,)=3m; Length BC (1,)=4.5 m; Length CD (/,) = 1.5 m ;

Uniformly distributed load in AB (w) = 1.5 KN/m ; Point load at D = 1kN ; Moment of inertia of
lengths AB and CD (J,,) = 1 and moment of inertia of length BC (/,,) = 2 I.

25.8. Continuous Beams with a Sinking Support

Sometimes, one of the supports of a continuous beam sinks down due to loading with respect to
the other supports which remain at the same level. The sinking of a support effects the moments at the
supports.

Fig. 25.12
Now consider a continuous beam ABC fixed at A and C and supported at B as shown in Fig.
25.12. Let the support B* sink down through a more distance than the support C sinks down from its
original position (or in other words from the support A),
Let 5, = Height of support A from B
and 5c = Height of support C from B.
We have already discussed in Art. 25.3 that in the span AB

2. The above formula has been derived by taking 5, and 6, as positive. But while solving the numericals on
sinking supports, care should always be taken to use the proper sign. The following guide rules should be
kept in mind for the purpose:

(i) The three moments equation always refer to two adjacent spans. The reference level should always be
taken as that of the common support.

(ii) The sign of 6 for the left and right support, should then be used by comparing its height with the
central support (positive for higher and negative for lower), e.g., Consider a continuous beam ABCD
in which let the support B sink down by an amount equal to 6. The three supports, namely A, C and D
will remain at the same level. Now, while using three moments equation for the spans AB and BC, the
values of 5, and 6. will be positive (because both the supports A and C are at higher level than that of
B). But while using three moments equation for the spans BC and CD, the value of 6, will be negative
(because the support B is at a lower level than that of C) and the value of 8, will be zero (because the
support D is at the same level as that of C).

EXAMPLE 25.7. A continuous beam ABC, shown in Fig. 25.13 carries a uniformly distributed
load of 50 KN on AB and BC. The support B sinks by 5 mm below A and C and the values of El is
constant throughout the beam.

Nores: 1. While considering the spans 0A and AB, the assumed support 0 and fixed support A are at the same level.
But the support B has sunk down. Therefore the value of 6, is taken as zero and that for 5, as negative.
2. While considering the spans AB and BC, the supports A and C are at the same level. But the support

25.9. Continuous Beams Subjected to a Couple

Sometimes, a continuous beam is subjected to a couple in one (or more) of the spans. Such a
beam is also analyses in the similar manner. The couple will cause negative moments in one part and
positive moments in the other part of the span. While taking moment of the bending moment diagram,
due care should be taken for the positive and negative bending moments.

26.1. Introduction

The moment distribution method, which was
first introduced by Prof. Hardy Cross in 1930, is
widely used for the analysis of all types of
indeterminate structures. In this method, all the
members of a structure are first assumed to be
fixed in position and direction and fixed end
moments due to external loads are obtained. Now
all the hinged joints are released, by applying an
equal and opposite moment and their effects are
evaluated on the opposite joints. The unbalanced
moment at a joint, is distributed in the two spans
in the ratio of their distribution factors. This
process is continued, till we reach the required
degree of precision.

Chapter 26 : Moment Distribution Method m 625

26.2. Sign Conventions

Though different types of sign conventions are adopted by different authors in their books, yet
the following sign conventions, which are widely used and internationally recognised will be used in
this book.

1. All the clockwise moments at the ends are taken as positive.
2. All the anticlockwise moments at the ends are taken as negative.

26.3. Carry Over Factor

We have already discussed in Art. 26.1 that the moments are applied on all the end joints of a
structure, whose effects are evaluated on the other joints. The ratio of moment produced at a joint to
the moment applied at the other joint, without displacing it, is called carry over factor. Now, we shall
find out the value of carry over factor in the following two cases of beam:

1. When the beam is fixed at one end and simply supported at the other.
2. When the beam is simply supported at both the ends.

26.4. Carry Over Factor for a Beam Fixed at One End and
Simply Supported at the Other
Consider a beam AB fixed at A and simply supported at B. Let a clockwise moment be applied at
the support B of the beam as shown in Fig. 26.1.
Let 1 = Span of the beam,

Since the beam is not subjected to any external loading, therefore the two reactions (R) must be
equal and opposite as shown in Fig. 26.1.

26.5. Carry Over Factor for a Beam Simply Supported at Both Ends

Consider a beam AB simply supported at A and B. Let a clockwise moment be applied at the
support B of the beam as shown in Fig. 26.2.

Chapter 26 : Moment Distribution Method m 627

Fig. 26.2
Let 1 = Span of the beam, and

tu = Clockwise moment at B.

Since the beam is simply supported at A, therefore there will be no fixing moment at A. Moreover,
as the beam is not subjected to any external loading, therefore the two reactions must be equal and
opposite as shown in Fig. 26.2.

26.6. Stiffness Factor

It is the moment required to rotate the end, while acting on it, through a unit angle without

26.7. Distribution Factors

Sometimes, a moment is applied on a structural joint to produce rotation, without the translation
of its members. This moment is distributed among all the connecting members of the joint in the
proportion of their stiffness.

Consider four members OA, OB, OC and OD meeting at A. Let the members OA and OC be fixed
at A and C, whereas the members OB and OD be hinged at B and D. Let the joint O be subjected to a
moment Lt as shown in Fig. 26.3.

Fig. 26.3
Let 1, = Length of the member OA,
I, = Moment of inertia of the member OA,

Chapter 26 : Moment Distribution Method m 629

E, = Modulus of elasticity of the member OA,
L,, 1,, E, = Corresponding values for the member OB,
L,, 1,, E, = Corresponding values for the member OC,
and L,, 1,, £, = Corresponding values for the member OD.

A little consideration will show that as a result of the moment UL, each member gets rotated
through some equal angle. Let this angle through which each member is rotated be 9.

We know that the stiffness of member OA,

The quantities ROE and i are known as distribution factors for the members OA, OB, OC

and OD respectively. The moments |L,, L,, H, and [, are known as distributed moments.

EXAMPLE 26.1. Five members OA, OB, OC, OD and OE meeting at O, are hinged at A and
C and fixed at B, D and E. The lengths of OA, OB, OC, OD and OE are 3 m, 4m, 2m, 3m and 5
m and their moments of inertia are 400 mm’, 300 mm’, 200 mm’, 300 mm* and 250 mm*
respectively. Determine the distribution factors for the members and the distributed moments,
when a moment of 4000 kN-m is applied at O.

So.ution: Given: Length OA =3m; LengthOB=4m; LengthOC=2m,; Length OD =3 m;
Length OE = 5 m; Moment of inertia of OA = 400 mm* ; Moment of inertia of OB = 300 mm* ;
Moment of inertia of OC = 200 mm* ; Moment of inertia of OD = 300 mm* ; Moment of inertia of OF
= 250 mm‘ and moment on D = 4000 kN-m.

Now complete the column for stiffness for all the members, keeping in mind whether the member

26.8. Application of Moment Distribution Method to Various Types
of Continuous Beams

In the previous articles, we have studied the principles of the moment distribution method. First
of all, all the supports are assumed to be clamped and fixing moments are found out for all the spans.
The unbalanced moment at a support is distributed among the two spans in the ratio of their stiffness
factors and their effects are evaluated on the opposite joints. This process is continued till we reach
the desired degree of precision. Though the moment distribution method has very wide applications
yet in the proceeding articles, we shall discuss its application to the following types of beams only:
Beams with fixed end supports,
Beams with simply supported ends,
Beams with end span overhanging and

PY YP

Beams with a sinking support.

Chapter 26 : Moment Distribution Method m= 631
26.9. Beams with Fixed End Supports

Sometimes, a continuous beam is fixed at its one or both ends. In such a case, the fixed end
moments are obtained and the unbalanced moment is distributed in two spans in the ratio of their
distribution factors.

Chapter 26 : Moment Distribution Method m 633

We find that the fixing moment at B in span AB, is + 6.0 KN-m and that in span BC, is — 9.0 kN-
m. Thus there is an unbalanced moment equal to (— 9.0 + 6.0) = — 3.0 kN-m. Now, distribute this
unbalanced moment (equal to — 3.0 KN-m) into the spans AB and BC in the ratio of their distribution
factors i.e., + 1.5 KN and + 1.5 KN. Now *carry over the effects of these distributed moments at A and

D equal to 5X 1.5 =+0.75 KN. Then distribute the unbalanced moment at B (In this case, there is no

carry over moment from A or D at B. So the distribution of moment at B is zero). Now, find out the
final moments at A, B and C in the spans AB and BC, by algebraically adding the respective values as
shown in the last column of the table.

We know that the bending moment at the centre of the span AB, treating it as a simply supported

** Though the moment at B in the span AB, is positive and moment at C in the span BC is positive in the
table, yet these moments are taken as negative in the bending moment diagram. The reason for the same
is that these points the moments tend to bend the beam with convexity upwards.

Now complete the shear force diagram and elastic curve as shown in Fig. 26.7 (c) and (d).

26.10. Beams with Simply Supported Ends

Sometimes, a continuous beam is simply supported curve on one or both of its ends. We know
that the fixing moment on a simply supported end is zero. Therefore in such a case, the simply supported
ends are released by applying equal and opposite moments and their effects are carried over on the
opposite joints. It may also be noted that no moment is carried over from the opposite joint to the
simply supported end.

A continuous beam ABCD is simply supported over three spans of 6 m, 5 m and 4 m respec-
tively. The beam carries point loads of 90 KN and 80 KN at 2 m and 8 m from the support A and
a uniformly distributed load of 30 kKN-m over the span CD. Find the moments and reactions at
the supports. [Ans. 68.4 kN-m ; 44.8kN; 48.6 kN; 94.1 kN; 98.5 kN]

26.11. Beams with End Span Overhanging

Sometimes, a beam is overhanging at its one or both the end supports. In such a case, the bending

moment at the support near the overhanging end will be due to the load over the overhanging portion
and will remain constant, irrespective of the moments on the other supports. It is thus obvious that the
distribution factors over the support having one span overhanging will be 1 and 0. Moreover, this
support is considered as a simply supported for the purpose of calculating distribution factors in the
span, adjoining the overhanging span.

EXAMPLE 26.4. A beam ABCD 9 m long is simply supported at A, B and C such that the span
AB is 3 m, span BC is 4.5 mand the overhanging CD is 1.5 m. It carries a uniformly distributed load
of 1.5 kN/m in span AB and a point load of 1 KN at the free end B. The moment of inertia of the beam
in span AB is I and that in the span BC is 21. Draw the B.M. and S.F. diagrams of the beam.

27.1. Introduction

In workshops and factories, a turning force
is always applied to transmit energy by rotation.
This turning force is applied either to the rim of a
pulley, keyed to the shaft or at any other suitable
point at some distance from the axis of the shaft.
The product of this turning force and the distance
between the point of application of the force and
the axis of the shaft is known as torque, turning
moment or twisting moment. And the shaft is said
to be subjected to torsion. Due to this torque,
every cross-section of the shaft is subjected to
some shear stress.

27.2. Assumptions for Shear
Stress in a Circular Shaft
Subjected to Torsion

Following assumptions are made, while

654 m Strength of Materials

finding out shear stress in a circular shaft subjected to torsion:
1. The material of the shaft is uniform throughout.
2. The twist along the shaft is uniform.

3. Normal cross-sections of the shaft, which were plane and circular before the twist, remain plane
and circular even after the twist.

4. All diameters of the normal cross-section, which were straight before the twist, remain straight
with their magnitude unchanged, after the twist.

A little consideration will show that the above assumptions are justified, if the torque applied is
small and the angle of twist is also small.

27.3. Torsional Stresses and Strains

Fig. 27.1

Consider a circular shaft fixed at one end and subjected to a torque at the other end as shown in
Fig. 27.1.

Let T = Torque in N-mm,
! = Length of the shaft in mm and
R

As a result of this torque, every cross-section of the shaft will be subjected to shear stresses. Let
the line CA on the surface of the shaft be deformed to CA’ and OA to OA’ as shown in Fig. 27.1.

Radius of the circular shaft in mm.

Let ZACA’ = 6 in degrees
ZAOA’ = @ inradians
t = Shear stress induced at the surface and

C = Modulus of rigidity, also known as torsional rigidity of the
shaft material.

We know that shear strain = Deformation per unit length

27.4. Strength of a Solid Shaft

The term, strength of a shaft means the maximum torque or power, it can transmit. As a matter of
fact, we are always interested in calculating the torque, a shaft can withstand or transmit.

Let R = Radius of the shaft in mm and
t = Shear stress developed in the outermost layer of the shaft in
N/mm?

Consider a shaft subjected to a torque T as shown in Fig. 27.2. Now let us consider an element of
area da of thickness dx at a distance x from the centre of the shaft as shown in Fig. 27.2.

We know that turning moment of this element,

EXAMPLE 27.1. A circular shaft of 50 mm diameter is required to transmit torque from one
shaft to another. Find the safe torque, which the shaft can transmit, if the shear stress is not to
exceed 40 MPa.

So.ution. Given: Diameter of shaft (D) = 50 mm and maximum shear stress (t) = 40 MPa

EXAMPLE 27.2. A solid steel shaft is to transmit a torque of 10 kN-m. If the shearing stress
is not to exceed 45 MPa, find the minimum diameter of the shaft.
So.uTIoNn. Given: Torque (T) = 10 kN-m = 10 x 10° N-mm and maximum shearing stress (T) = 45

Let D = Minimum diameter of the shaft in mm.

27.5. Strength of a Hollow Shaft

It means the maximum torque or power a hollow shaft can transmit from one pulley to another.
Now consider a hollow circular shaft subjected to some torque.

Let R = Outer radius of the shaft in mm,
r = Inner radius of the shaft in mm, and

t = Maximum shear stress developed in the outer most layer of
the shaft material.

Now consider an elementary ring of thickness dx at a
distance x from the centre as shown in Fig. 27.3.

We know that area of this ring,

Note: We have already discussed in Art. 27.3 that the shear stress developed at a point is proportional to its
distance from the centre of the shaft. It is thus obvious that in the central portion of a shaft, the shear
stress induced is very small. In order to utilize the material to the fuller extent, hollow shafts are used.

Example 27.3. A hollow shaft of external and internal diameter of 80 mm and 50 mm is
required to transmit torque from one end to the other. What is the safe torque it can transmit, if the
allowable shear stress is 45 MPa ?

27.6. Power Transmitted by a Shaft

We have already discussed that the main purpose of a shaft is to transmit power from one shaft to
another in factories and workshops. Now consider a rotating shaft, which transmits power from one
of its ends to another.

Let N = No. of revolutions per minute and
T = Average torque in kN-m.

27.8. Replacing a Shaft

Sometimes, we are required to replace a solid shaft by a hollow one, or vice versa. In such cases,
the torque transmitted by the new shaft should be equal to that by the replaced shaft. But sometimes,
there are certain other conditions which have also to be considered while designing the new shaft.

EXAMPLE 27.15. A solid steel shaft of 60 mm diameter is to be replaced by a hollow steel

shaft of the same material with internal diameter equal to half of the external diameter. Find the
diametres of the hollow shaft and saving in material, if the maximum allowable shear stress is
same for both shafts.

EXERCISE 27.2

1. Find the torque a solid shaft of 100 mm diameter can transmit, if the maximum angle of twist is
1.5° in a length of 2 m. Take C = 70 GPa. (Ans. 9.0 kN-m)
2. A hollow shaft of external and internal diameters as 80 mm and 40 mm is required to transmit

3. A solid shaft and a hollow circular shaft, whose inside diameter is 3/4 of the outside diameter

two shafts, if maximum shear stress developed in both the shaft is also equal. (Ans. 1.76)
4. A solid shaft of 150 mm diameter is to be replaced by a hollow shaft of the same material with

5. A shaft is transmitting 100 kW at 180 r.p.m. If the allowable shear stress in the shaft material is
60 MPa, determine the suitable diameter for the shaft. The shaft is not to twist more than 1° in
a length of 3 metres. Take C = 80 GPa. (Ans. 103.8 mm)

27.9. Shaft of Varying Sections

Sometimes a shaft, made up of different lengths having different cross-sectional areas, is required
to transmit some torque (or horse power) from one pulley to another.

668 m Strength of Materials

A little consideration will show that for such a shaft, the torque transmitted by individual sections
have to be calculated first and the minimum value of these torques will be the strength of such a shaft.
The angle of twist for such a shaft may be found out as usual.

EXAMPLE 27.19. The stepped steel shaft shown in Fig. 27.4 is subjected to a torque (T) at
the free end, and a torque (2T) in the opposite direction at the junction of the two sizes.

Fig. 27.4
What is the total angle of twist at the free end, if maximum shear stress in the shaft is limited to
70 MPa? Assume the modulus of rigidity to be 84 GPa.

So.uTIon. Given: Torque at C = T (anticlockwise); Torque at B = 2T (clockwise) ; Diameter of
shaft AB (D,,) = 100 mm ; Diameter of shaft BC (Dg-) = 50 mm ; Maximum shear stress (T) = 70
MPa = 70 N/mm” and modulus of rigidity (C) = 84 GPa = 84 x 10° N/mm”.

Since the torques at B and C are in opposite directions, therefore the effect of these two torques
will be studied first independently, sum of the two twists (one in clockwise direction and the other in
anticlockwise direction).

First of all, let us first find out the value of torque T at C. It may be noted that if the value of
torque is obtained for the portion AB, it will induce more stress in the portion BC (because the portion
BC is of less diameter). Therefore we shall calculate the torque for the portion BC (because it will not
induce stress more than the permissible in the portion AB).

We know that the torque at C,

T = eX™ (Dac) = 1g x 10% (50)° = 1.718 x 10° N-mm

We also know that polar moment of inertia of the solid circular shaft AB,

From the geometry of the shaft, we find that the twist at B (due to torque of 27 at B) will continue
at C also. Since the directions of both the twists are opposite to each other, therefore net angle of twist
at C

= 0.0624 — 0.005 = 0.0574 rad = 3.29° — Ans.

ExampLe 27.20. A shaft ABC of 500 mm length and 40 mm external diameter is bored, for
a part of its length AB to a 20 mm diameter and for the remaining length BC to a 30 mm diameter
bore as shown in Fig. 27.5. If the shear stress is not to exceed 80 MPa, find the maximum power,
the shaft can transmit at a speed of 200 r.p.m.

If the angle of twist in the length of 20 mm diameter bore is equal to that in the 30 mm diameter
bore, find the length of the shaft that has been bored to 20 mm and 30 mm diameter.

27.10. Composite Shaft

Sometimes, a shaft is made up of composite section i.e., one type of shaft rigidly sleeved over
another type of shaft. At the time of sleeving, the two shafts are joined together in such a way, that the
composite shaft behaves like a single shaft. The total torque transmitted by the composite shaft is
shared by the two shafts, depending upon their diameters and elastic properties.

EXAMPLE 27.21. A composite shaft consists of copper rod of 30 mm diameter enclosed
in a steel tube of external diameter 40 mm and 5 mm thick. The shaft is required to transmit
a torque of 0.5 kN-m. Determine the shearing stresses developed in the copper and steel, if
both the shafts have equal lengths and welded to a plate at each end, so that their twists are
equal. Take C, = 40 GPa and C, = 80 GPa.

SoLuTion. Given: Diameter of copper rod (D,) = 30 mm ; External diameter of steel tube (D,) =

40 mm ; Thickness of steel tube = 5 mm ; Therefore internal diameter of steel tube (ds) = 40 — (2 x

stress, the strain energy stored is,

where t = Shear stress,

Chapter 27 : Torsion of Circular Shafts m= 673

C = Modulus of rigidity or shear modulus and
V = Volume of the body.
But in the case of a solid circular shaft, the torsional stress varies from zero at the central axis to
a maximum T at the surface. Now, consider a circular shaft of diameter D, subjected to shear stress (T)

at its surface. Now, let us consider an elementary ring of thickness dx and a distance x from the axis of
the shaft.

27.12. Shaft Couplings

Sometimes, due to the non-availability of a single shaft of the required length, it becomes necessary
to connect two shafts together. This is usually done by means of flanged couplings as shown in Fig.
27.6 (a) and (b).

The flanges of the two shafts are joined together by bolts and nuts or rivets and the torque is then
transferred from one shaft to another through the couplings. A little consideration will show that as
the torque is transferred through the bolts, it is thus obvious that the bolts are subjected to shear stress.
As the diameter of bolts is small, as compared to the diameter of the flanges, therefore shear stress is
as assumed to be uniform in the bolts. The design of a shaft coupling means (a) design of bolts and (b)
design of keys.

Fig. 27.6
Now we shall discuss the above two designs one by one.

27.13. Design of Bolts

Consider a shaft coupling, transmitting torque from one shaft to another.
Let Tt, = Shear stress in the shaft,
d = Diameter of the shaft,
D = Diameter of the bolt pitch circle,
(i.e., the circle on which the bolts are arranged)
d, = Diameter of the bolts,
n = No. of bolts and
tT, = Shear stress in the bolts.
We know that the torque transmitted by the shaft,

This is the required equation for the number of bolts or the diameter of bolts.

As a matter of fact, a flange is attached to a shaft by means
of a key. A rectangular notch is cut on the circumference of the Key

shaft and a similar notch is cut on inner side of the flange. The 5 Shaft
flange is then placed over the shaft in such a way, that the two A

notches form a rectangular hole. A rectangular key is then inserted
into the hole, and the flange is said to be keyed to the shaft is
shown in Fig. 27.7.

A little consideration will show that the torque is transmitted
by the shaft to the flange through the key. It is thus obvious that
the key is also subjected to the shear stress.

Let ! = Length of the key,

b = Width of the key and
Ty, = Shear stress in the key.

Fig. 27.7

We know that the torque resisted by the key,
T = Area x Stress x Radius

We also know that the torque transmitted by the shaft,

Since the torque resisted by the key should be equal to the torque transmitted by the shaft, therefore
equating (7) and (ii),

1 3 [-b-T,-d

—X1pXd> = ———kK —

This is the required equation for the length or width of the key.

Note. Sometimes the torque is not transmitted by flange coupling and key. But it is transmitted through gears.
In such a case, the gear ratio should also be taken into account, for calculating the revolutions of the
shaft.

Example 27.24. A 80mm shaft transmits power at maximum shear stress of 60 MPa when
the stress in key and coupling bolts is 50 MPa and 40 MPa respectively. The coupling has 4 bolts
arranged symmetrically along a circle of 200 mm diameter. Determine the diameter of bolts. If
the key is 20 mm wide, determine its length.

SoLuTion. Given: Diameter of shaft (d) = 80 mm ; Shear stress in shaft (t 's) = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm’;
Stress in key (T,) = 50 MPa = 50 N/mm? ; Stress in bolts (t,) = 40 MPa = 40 N/mm? ; No. of bolts

28.1. Introduction

A spring is a device, in which the material is
arranged in such a way that it can undergo a
considerable change, without getting permanently
distorted. A spring is used to absorb energy due
to resilience, which may be restored as and when
required. The quality of a spring is judged from
the energy it can absorb e.g., in a watch the spring
is wound to absorb strain energy. This energy is
released to run the watch, when the spring regains
its original shape. A carriage spring is used to
absorb shocks. It is thus obvious that a spring,
which is capable of absorbing the greatest amount
of energy for the given stress is known to be the
best one.

28.2. Stiffness of a Spring

The load required to produce a unit deflection in a spring is called spring stiffness or stiffness of
a spring.
28.3. Types of Springs

We have already discussed that a spring is used for absorbing energy due to resilience. Thus in
general, the springs are of the following two types depending upon the type of resilience.

1. Bending spring and 2. Torsion spring.

28.4. Bending Springs

A spring, which is subjected to bending only and the resilience is also due to it, is known as
bending spring. Laminated springs or leaf springs are also called bending springs.

28.5. Torsion Springs

A spring, which is subjected to torsion or twisting moment only and the resilience is also due to
it, is known as a torsion spring. Helical springs are also called torsion springs. Some springs are
subjected to bending as well as torsion.

28.6. Forms of Springs

Though there are many forms of springs, which are made by the manufacturers, yet the following
types of springs are commonly used in Engineering practice.

1. Carriage springs or leaf springs 2. Helical springs.

28.7. Carriage Springs or Semi-elliptical Type Leaf Springs

These are also called laminated springs and are of two types: (1) semi-elliptical types (i.e., simply
supported at its ends subjected to central load) and (2) quarter-elliptical (i.e., cantilever) types.

Carriage Springs or Leaf Springs

The carriage springs are widely used in railway wagons, coaches and road vehicles these days.
These are used to absorb shocks, which give an unpleasant feeling to the passengers. The energy
absorbed by a laminated spring, during a shock, is released immediately without doing any useful
work.

A laminated spring, in its simplest form, consists of a number of parallel strips of a metal having
different lengths but same width and placed one over the other in laminations as shown in Fig. 28.1.

Chapter 28 : Springs m 681

All the plates are initially bent to the same radius and are free to slide one over the other. When the
spring is loaded to the designed load, all the plates become flat and the central deflection disappears.
The purpose of this type of arrangement of plates is to make the spring of uniform strength throughout.
This is achieved by tapering the ends of the laminations. The semi-elliptical type spring rests on the
axis of the vehicle and its top plate is pinned at the ends to the chassis of the vehicle.

Now consider a carriage spring pinned at its both ends, and carrying an upward load at its centre
as shown in Fig. 28.1.

A little consideration will show, that the load will be acting on the spring on the lowermost plate
and it will be shared equally on the two ends of the top plate as shown in Fig. 28.1. We know that the

28.8 Quarter-Elliptical Type Leaf Springs

The quarter-elliptical type leaf springs are
rarely used, except as certain parts in some
machines. Like a carriage spring, a quarter-
elliptical type leaf spring consists of a number
of parallel strips of a metal having different
lengths but same width and placed one over the
other in laminations as shown in Fig. 28.2. All
the plates are initially bent to the same radius
and are free to slide one over the other.

Now consider a quarter-elliptical type leaf
spring subjected to a load at its free end as shown

in Fig. 28.2. Fig. 28.2. Quarter-elliptical spring.
Let ! = Length of the spring,

28.9. Helical Springs

It is a torsion springs and made up of a wire coiled into a helix.
Though, there are many types of helical springs, yet the following
are important from the subject point of view:

1. Closely-coiled helical springs and
2. Open-coiled helical springs.

28.10. Closely-coiled Helical Springs

In a closely coiled helical spring, the spring wire is coiled so
close that the each turn is practically a plane at right angles to the
axis of the helix and the wire is subjected to torsion. The bending | _
stress is negligible as compared to the torsional stress. A closely- | ¢
coiled helical spring may be subjected to (1) axial loading and (2)
axial twist. In this chapter, we shall discuss both the cases one by Helical springs

In an open helical spring, the spring wire is coiled in such a way, that there is large gap between
the two consecutive turns. As a result of this, the spring can take compressive load also. An open

helical spring, like a closed helical spring, may be subjected to (1) axial loading or (2) axial twist. In
this chapter, we shall discuss only the first case.

28.14. Springs in Series and Parallel

In the previous articles, we have been discussing the use of one helical spring only. But sometimes
two (or even more) springs are used at one place. Though there are many ways of using these springs,
yet the springs in (i) series and (ii) parallel are important from the subject point of view.

1. Springs in series

In this case, the two springs are connected in series as shown in Fig. 28.6 (a). Each spring is
subjected to the same load applied at the end of one spring. A little consideration will show that the
total extension of the assembly is equal to the algebraic sum of the extensions of the two springs.
2. Springs in parallel

In this case, the two springs are connected in parallel as shown in Fig. 28.6 (b). The extension of
each spring is the same. A little consideration will show that the load applied on the assembly is
shared by the two springs.

EXAMPLE 28.9. Two-close coiled helical springs wound from the same wire, but with different
core radii having equal no. of coils are compressed between rigid plates at their ends. Calculate
the maximum shear stress induced in each spring, if the wire diameter is 10 mm and the load
applied between the rigid plates is 500 N. The core radii of the springs 100 mm and 75 mm
respectively.

Riveted Joints

29.1. Introduction

We see that in a steel structure, such as plate
girder, roof truss, boiler shells, ship-building, etc.,
its various members, which constitute the structure,
are connected to one another. These members are
connected either by welding or by rivets. In
riveting, specially made ductile metal pins, called
rivets, are inserted into the holes of the members.
The rivets are hammered for permanent fastenings.
It may be noted that a riveted joint is used in a
structure only when it is a must, as it weakens the
section due to hole.

29.2. Types of Riveted Joints

Following are two types of riveted joints,
depending upon the way in which the members
are connected:

1. Lap joint 2. Butt joint.

696 m Strength of Materials
29.3. Lap Joint

It is a joint in which a part of one member overlaps the other and the two members are then
riveted together as shown in Fig. 29.1.

Fig. 29.1. Lap joint.
29.4. Butt Joint

It is a joint in which the edges of the two members butt (i.e., touch) against each other and a cover
plate is placed either on one side or on both sides of the two members. The cover plate is then riveted
together with both the members. Butt joints are of the following two types:

1. Single cover butt joint, 2. Double cover butt joint

29.5. Single Cover Butt Joint

It is a joint in which the edges of the two members butt against each other, and only one cover
plate is placed on one side of the members and riveted together as shown in Fig. 29.2.

Fig. 29.2. Single cover butt joint.

29.6. Double Cover Butt Joint

It is a joint in which the edges of the two members butt against each other, and two cover plates
placed on both the sides of the member and riveted together as shown in Fig. 29.3.

Fig. 29.3. Double cover butt joint.
In addition to the above, following are the types of the riveted joints, depending upon the way in
which the rivets are connected:

1. Single riveted joint,

29.7. Single Riveted Joint

It is a joint in which there is a single row of rivets in a lap joint as shown in Fig. 29.4(a). Or there
is a single row of rivets on each side in a butt joint as shown in Fig. 29.4(b).

are two rows of rivets on each side in a butt joint as shown in Fig. 29.5 (b).

29.9. Multiple Riveted Joint

It is a joint in which there are more than two rows of rivets in a lap joint or more than two rows
of rivets on each side in a butt joint. A multiple riveted joint may be a triple riveted joint or quadruple
riveted joint.

29.10. Chain Riveted Joint

It is a joint in which every rivet of a row is opposite to other rivet of the other row as shown in
Fig. 29.6.

Fig. 29.6. Chain riveted joint. Fig. 29.7. Zig-zag riveted joint

29.11. Zig-zag Riveted Joint

It is a joint in which the spacing of the rivets is staggered, in such a way, that every rivet is in the
middle of the two rivets of the opposite row as shown in Fig. 29.7.
29.12. Diamond Riveted Joint

It is a joint in which the number of rivets decreases as we proceed from innermost row to the
outermost row as shown in Fig. 29.8. It will be interesting to know that a diamond riveted joint is
adopted in butt joint only.

Fig. 29.8. Diamond riveted joint.

Chapter 29 : Riveted Joints m 699
29.13. Pitch of Rivets

The centre to centre distance between the two consecutive rivets in a row, is called the pitch of
the rivets and is denoted by the letter p as shown in Fig. 29.9.

Fig. 29.9. Pitch of rivets
In some cases, the pitch is different for different rows. In such cases, the pitch is the least in the
innermost row.

29.14. Failure of Riveted Joint

A riveted joint may fail due to many ways. But the following are more important from the subject
point of view:

1. Failure of the rivets. 2. Failure of the plates.

We shall discuss both the above mentioned cases of failure, in more details, one by one.

29.15. Failure of the Rivets
A rivet may fail due to either of the following two reasons:
1. Shearing of the rivet. 2. Crushing of the rivet.
Now we shall discuss both the cases one by one.

29.16. Shearing of the Rivets

The plates, which are connected by the rivets, exert tensile stress on the rivets. If the rivets are
unable to resist the stresses, they may be sheared off as shown in Fig. 29.10. It will be interesting to
know that

Fig. 29.10. Shearing of rivets
1. The rivets are in single shear in a lap joint and in a single cover butt joint.
2. The rivets are in double shear in a double cover butt joint.

29.17. Crushing of the Rivets

Sometimes, the rivets do not actually shear off, under the tensile stress, but are crushed as shown
in Fig. 29.11. Such a failure of rivet is called crushing of the rivet.

Fig. 29.11. Crushing of rivets

700 Strength of Materials

29.18. Failure of the plates
A plate may fail in many ways. But the following are important from the subject point of view:
1. Tearing off the plate across a row of rivets,
2. Tearing off the plate at an edge.

29.19. Tearing off the Plate across a Row of Rivets

Due to the tensile stresses, in the main plates, the main plate or cover plates may tear off across
a row of rivets as shown in Fig. 29.12. In such cases, we consider only one pitch length of the plate,
since every rivet is responsible for that much length of plate only.

Fig. 29.12. Tearing across a row of rivets

29.20. Tearing off the Plate at an Edge

A plate may also fail due to tearing at an edge as shown in Fig. 29.13. This can be avoided by
keeping the centre of the nearest rivet, from the edge of the plate, at least two times the diameter of the
rivet.

Fig. 29.13. Tearing off at an edge
29.21. Strength of a Rivet

We have seen in arts. 29.16 and 29.17 that a rivet may fail either due to its shearing off or due to
its crushing. Thus, while calculating the strength of a rivet we see as to how much resistance it can
offer. The resistance offered by a rivet is known as its strength or the value of the rivet. Following two
values of a rivet are important from the subject point of view:

1. Shearing value. 2. Bearing value.
1. Shearing value

The resistance offered by a rivet, to be sheared off is known as its shearing value. Mathematically,
pull required to shear off the rivet,

TM 32
P. = —xd°xt
A

Ss
where d = Diameter of the rivet and
t = Safe permissible shear stress for the rivet material.
If the rivet is in double shear (i.e., in the case of a double cover butt joint), the corresponding

Chapter 29 : Riveted Joints m= 701

equation becomes:

T 42
Po = 2x—xd° xt
2. Bearing value

The resistance offered by a rivet to be crushed is known as the bearing value. Mathematically,
pull required to crush the rivet,

P, = 0,xXtxd
where 0, = Safe permissible bearing stress for the rivet material,
t = Thickness of the main plate and
d = Diameter of the rivet.

Note: Sometimes, the bearing strength of a rivet is also termed as its crushing strength. And permissible
bearing stress is termed as permissible crushing stress (0,).

29.22. Strength of a Plate

We have seen in Art. 29.19 that the plate may fail due to its tearing off across the row of rivets.
Thus, while calculating the strength of a plate, we see as to how much resistance it can offer. This
resistance offered by the plate, against tearing off, is known as the strength of the plate or value of the
plate. Mathematically, pull required to tear off the plate,

29.23. Strength of a Riveted Joint

The strength of a joint may be defined as the maximum force, which it can transmit, without
causing it to fail. We have seen in Arts. 29.21 and 29.22 that P,, P, and P, are the pulls required to
shear of the rivet, crushing of the rivet and tearing of the plate. A little consideration will show that if
we go on increasing the pull on a riveted joint, it will fail when the least of these three pulls is reached;
because a higher value of the other pulls will never reach, since the joint has already failed, either by
shearing of the rivet or by crushing of the rivet or by tearing of the plate.

If the joint is continuous (as in the case of boilers) the strength is calculated per pitch length. But
if the length of the joint is small, the strength is calculated for the whole length of the plate.

29.24. Efficiency of a Riveted Joint

The efficiency of a riveted joint is the ratio of the strength of the joint, to the strength of the
unriveted plate. Mathematically

702 wm Strength of Materials

Example 29.1. A single riveted lap joint is made in 12 mm thick plates with 22 mm diameter
rivets. Determine the strength of the rivet, if the pitch of the rivets is 60 mm. Take allowable
stresses in shearing as 60 MPa, in bearing as 150 MPa and in tearing as 80 MPa respectively.

So.uTion. Given: Thickness of plates (t) = 12 mm; Diameter of rivets (d) = 22 mm ; Pitch (p) =

60 mm ; Allowable shear stress (t) = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm? ; Allowable stress in bearing (0,,) = 150 MPa
= 150 N/mm” and allowable stress in tearing (o,) = 80 MPa = 80 N/mm’.
First of all, let us calculate the pulls required for shearing and crushing of the rivets as well as
tearing of the main plates.
1. Shearing of rivets. We know that in a lap joint, the rivets are in single shear. Thus, in a single
riveted lap joint, the strength of one rivet in single shear is taken. Therefore shearing strength of
the rivet,

P, = tx Tx (dy = 60x 7X (22)? =22 810N = 22.81 kN ...(i)
2. Bearing of rivets. We know that in a single riveted joint, the strength of one rivet in bearing is
taken. Therefore bearing strength of the rivet,
P, = 6,XtxXd=150 x 12 x 22 = 39 600 N = 39.6 KN .-(ii)
3. Tearing of the plate. We also know that in a continuous joint, the strength of one pitch length is
taken. Therefore tearing strength of the main plate,
P, = 0,(p—d) t= 80 (60 — 22) 12 = 36 480 N = 36.48 kN_ ...(iii)
Thus strength of the rivet joint is the least of the above mentioned three values P,, P,, and P.. i.e.,
22.81 KN Ans.
EXAMPLE 29.2. Two plates 10 mm thick are joined by a double riveted lap joint. The pitch
of each row of rivets is 50 mm. The rivets are 20 mm diameter and the permissible stresses are:
Shearing of rivets = 70 MPa
Bearing of rivets = 160 MPa
Tearing of the plate = 100 MPa
Determine the maximum tensile force on the joint and efficiency of the joint.
So.uTIoN. Given: Thickness of plates (t) = 10 mm ; Pitch (p) = 50 mm; Diameter of rivets (d)
= 20mm _; Permissible stress in shearing (t) = 70 MPa = 70 N/mm? ; Permissible stress in bearing
(6,) = 160 MPa = 160 N/mm? and permissible stress in tearing (0,) = 100 MPa = 100 N/mm’.

Maximum tensile force of the joint

First of all, let us calculate the pulls required for shearing and crushing of the rivets as well as
tearing of the main plates.
1. Shearing of rivets. We know that in a lap joint, the rivets are in single shear. Thus, in a double
riveted lap joint, the strength of two rivets in single shear is taken. Therefore shearing strength
of the rivets.

2. Bearing of rivets. We know that in a double riveted joint, the strength of two rivets is taken.
Therefore bearing strength of the rivets,
P, = 2x0,xXtxd=2x 160 x 10 x 20 = 64 000 N = 64 KN...(ii)
3. Tearing of the plates. We know that in a continuous joint, the strength of one pitch length is
taken. Therefore tearing strength of the main plates,
P, = 0,(p—d) t= 100 (50 — 20) 10 N = 30 000 N = 30KN ...(iii)

crushing stress of plates (6,.)= 160 MPa = 160 N/mm” and Permissible tearing stress of plates (0,) =
100 MPa =

Pull per pitch length of the joint

First of all, let us calculate the pulls required for shearing and crushing of the rivets as well as
tearing of the main plates.
1. Shearing of rivets. We know that in a double cover butt joints, the rivets are in double shear.
Thus, in a double riveted double covered butt joint, the strength of two rivets in double shear is
taken. Therefore strength of the rivets,

2. Crushing of the rivets. We know that in a double riveted joint, the strength of two rivets in
crushing is taken. Therefore crushing strength of rivets,

P, = 2X0,xXtxd=2 x 160 x 20 x 25 = 160 000 N
160 000 N = 160 kN (ii)

3. Tearing of the plates. We know that in a continuous joint, the strength of one pitch length is
taken. Therefore tearing strength of the main plates,

P,=0,(p—d)t = 100 (100 — 25) 20 = 150 000 N = 150 kN ...(iii)
Thus, pull per pitch length of the joint is the least of the above mentioned three values P,, P,, and

Fig. 29.14
The rivets are 30 mm in diameter. The allowable working stresses are 70 MPa in shear, 180
MPa in bearing and 90 MPa in tearing. What is the safe load on the spliced strap and efficiency
of the joint?

So.uTION. Given: Width of plates (b) = 200 mm; Thickness of main plates (t )= 20 mm; diameters
of rivets (d) = 30 mm; Thickness of cover plates (t,) = 15 mm; Premissible shear stress in rivets (t) =
70 MPa=70 N/mm’; Permissible bearing stress in rivets (0,,) = 180 MPa = 180 N/mm’ and permissible
tearing stress in plates (6,) = 90 MPa = 90 N/mm’.

Safe load on the spliced strap

First of all, let us calculate the pulls required for shearing and crushing of the rivets as well as
tearing of the main plate and cover plates. Since the joint is not a continuous one, therefore we shall
find out the strength of the joint for 3 rivets and full plate width.

1. Shearing of rivets. We know that in a double covered butt joints, the rivets are in double shear.
Therefore strength of 3 rivets in double shear,

Ss

P= 3X 2x x TX (dy = 6X 70x TX 30)" = 297 000 N

= 297kN ..(2)

2. Bearing of rivets. Since there are 3 rivets on either side of the joints, therefore bearing strength

of 3 rivets,
P, = 3x0,Xtxd=3 x 180 x 20 x 30 = 324 000 N = 324 kN
(ii)
From the above two values (i.e., P, and P,), we find that strength of 3 rivets is lesser of these
values i.e., 297 KN. Therefore, strength of one rivet is 297/3 = 99 KN.

3. Tearing of the main plates. We know that as the joint is not continuous, therefore strength of the
whole plate is calculated as section (1-1) and (2-2) independently. We also know that at section
(1-1), there is only one rivet hole. Therefore tearing strength of the main plate at section (1-1),

P, = 0,[b-( xd)] t= 90 [200- (1 x 30)] 20 = 306 000 N
= 306 kN ... (iii)
We know that at section (2-2), there are two rivet holes. Therefore tearing strength of the main
plate at section (2-2),
= 0,[b- (2 x d)] t= 90 [200 — (2 x 30)] 20 = 252 000 N
= 252 kN

Chapter 29 : Riveted Joints m 705

From the above two values of Pt, and Pt,, we find that tearing strength of the main plate appears
to be less at section (2-2). But it will be interesting to know that for tearing of the plate at section (2-
2), the rivet in front of it (i.e., at section 1-1) must first give way. Therefore actual strength of the main
plate at section (2-2),
P, = 252 + Strength of one rivet = 252 + 99 = 351 kN .. (iv)
4. Tearing of cover plates. We know that the cover plates are weaker at section (2-2), where there
are 2 rivet holes. Therefore strength of two cover plates of section (2-2),
P,. = 9,[b-(2 x d)] 2t, = 90 [200 — (2 x 30)] 2x 15 N

So.uTIon. Given : Width of plates (b) = 300 mm ; Thickness of plates (t) = 16 mm ; Diameter of

* The reason for taking the strength of 3 rivets is that, there are only 3 rivets on either side of the joint.

706 wm Strength of Materials

Strength of the joint
First of all let, us calculate the pulls required for shearing and crushing of the rivets as well as
tearing of the main plate and cover plates. Since the joint is not a continuous one, therefore, we shall
find out the strength of the joint for 10 rivets and full plate width (as there are 10 rivets on either side
of the joints).
1. Shearing of rivets. We know that in a double covered butt joint, the rivets are in double shear.
Therefore strength of 10 rivets in double shear,

Ss

P= 10x 2x 7x (dy = 20x80 7X (25)" N

= 785 000 N = 785.0 kN (i)
2. Crushing of rivets. Since, there are 10 rivets on either side of the point, therefore crushing
strength of 10 rivets,
P. = 10x0,xtxd=10 x 160 x 16 x 25 = 640 000 N
= 640 kN ..-(ii)
From the above two values (i.e., P, and P..), we find that strength of 10 rivets is lesser of these
values i.e., 640 KN. Therefore strength of one rivet = 640/10 = 64 KN.

3. Tearing of the main plate. We know that as the joint is not continuous, therefore strength of
the whole plate is calculated at sections (1-1), (2-2), (3-3) and (4-4) independently. We also
know that at section (1-1), there is only one rivet hole. Therefore tearing strength of the main
plate at section (1-1),

P, = 6,[b-( xd)] t= 100 [300 - (1 x 25)] 16 N
= 440 000 N = 440 kN .-(iii)
We know, that at section (2-2), there are two rivet holes. Therefore tearing strength of the main
plate at section (2-2)
= 0,[b- (2 x d)] t= 100 [300 — (2 x 25)] 16 N
= 400 000 N = 400 kN
We also know, that for tearing of the plate at section (2-2), the rivet in front of it (i.e., at section
1-1) must first give way. Therefore actual strength of the main plate at section (2-2),
P.. = 400 + Strength of one rivet in front
= 400 + 64 = 464 kN ..(iv)

Similarly, at section (3-3) there are three rivet holes. Therefore tearing strength of the main plate
at section (3-3)

6, [b — (3 x d)] t= 100 [300 — (3 x 25)] 16 N
360 000 N = 360 KN
But actual strength of the main plate at section (3-3),

P., = 360 + Strength of three rivets in front
= 360 + (3 x 64) = 552 KN .(V)
and at section (4-4) there are four rivet holes. Therefore tearing strength of the main plate at
section (4-4)
= 0,[b- (4 x d)] t= 100 [300 — (4 x 25)] 16 N
= 320 000 N = 320 kN
But actual strength of the main plate at section (4-4),
O,, = 320 + Strength of six rivets in front
= 320 + (6 x 64) = 704 kN .(Vi)

Chapter 29 : Riveted Joints m 707

It will be interesting to know that more and more pull is required for tearing of the main plate, as

we move from the outermost section towards the innermost section.

4.

Tearing of cover plates. We know that the cover plates are weaker at section (4-4), where there
are 4 rivet holes. Therefore strength of two cover plates at section (4-4),

29.25. Design of a Riveted Joint

The design of riveted joints is an important job in one modern design office these days. A faulty

design can lead to lot many complications. While designing a riveted joint, for structural use, we
usually make the following assumptions:

1.

NAW ERY D

The load on joint is equally shared by all the rivets.
Initial tensile or shearing stress in the rivets is neglected.
Frictional forces between the plates are neglected.
Plates are rigid.

The shearing stress in all the rivets is uniform.

The bearing stress is uniform.

Bending of rivets is neglected.

708 wm Strength of Materials

It will be interesting to know that the above mentioned assumptions are very practical in actual
operations of the joint. As a matter of fact, we have to calculate a number of details for the given load.
But the following are important from the subject point of view:

1. Diameter of the rivets.
2. No. of rivets.
3. Pitch of rivets.
4. Thickness of the cover plates (in case of butt joints).
Following rules are observed, while designing a riveted joint:
1. Diameter of rivets
The diameter of the rivets in mm is obtained by the relation:

d = ot
where t = Thickness of the main plates in mm.
In no way, the diameter of the rivet is provided less than the thickness of the main plate.
2. Number of rivets

The number of rivets are usually calculated, when the length of the joint is small. But when the
joint is a continues one (as in the case of boilers), the number of rivets is not calculated. In a small
joint, the number of rivets

vit.
=
where P = Thickness of the main plates in mm.
R, = Rivet value (7e., least of the rivet value for shearing and bearing).

Sometimes, the number of rivets calculated by the above relation is not an integer. Then the
number of rivets i.e., N is taken to the next higher integer (i.e., if by the above relation, we obtain the
value of N = 5.3, then we shall provide 6 rivets).

3. Pitch of rivets
It is an important factor, while designing a riveted joint. It is calculated on the basis that the plate
strength, with one rivet hole, which should not exceed the total value of the rivets in charge of a pitch
length. It is done in the following ways:
1. Calculate the shearing strength of the rivet with due consideration, whether the rivet is in single
shear or double shear and the number of rivets.

2. Calculate the shearing strength of the rivet with due consideration to the number of rivets.

»

Calculate the tearing strength of the main plate with one rivet hole.
4. The minimum value obtained from (1) and (2) is taken as the rivet value. The strength of the
plate obtained from (3) should not exceed the rivet value.
Note. In general, the pitch should be between 2.5 to 4 times the diameter of the rivet. From practical
considerations, the pitch should not be less than 2d + 12 mm, where d is the diameter of the rivet in mm.

A little consideration will show, that the strength of the joint in such a case, will be tearing strength of the
plate i.e., P, (because the value of P, is taken lesser than the rivet values in shearing and bearing).

We know that strength of one rivet is lesser of these values (P, and P,) i.e., 25.13 KN. We also
know that tearing strength of the main plate in a continuous joint,
P, = 0,(p—d) t= 100 (p— 20) 10N

1000 (p — 20) N = (p — 20) KN ... (iii)

We also know that tearing strength of the main plate should be greater than or equal to the

strength of one rivet. i.e.,
(p — 20) 2 25.13

“ p 225.13 + 20 245.13 mm

But the pitch (p) should not be less than 2.5 d (i.e., 2.5 x 20 = 50 mm). Moreover, it should
not be less than 2d + 12 [i.e., (2 x 20) + 12 = 52 mm]. Therefore let us provide a pitch of 52

We know that strength of one rivet is lesser of these two values (P, and P..) i.e., 46.2 KN. We also
know that tearing strength of the main plate in a continuous plate,
P, = 0,(p—d) t= 100 (p—d) 12 = 1200 (p—d)N

29.26. Eccentric Riveted Connections

In the previous articles, we have discussed the cases Za

when the rivets have only to resist the linear displacement
of the plates. But sometimes, a rivet may have to resist
rotary displacement also in addition to linear
displacement.

Consider a bracket connection with a girder as
shown in Fig. 29.17. It may be noted that all the rivets
have to resist the following two types of displacement:
1. Linear displacement and
2. Rotary displacement.
1. Linear displacement
All the rivets have to offer resistance to the linear
displacement, due to the load P. This resistance i.e., force
is assumed to be uniform for all the rivets, and is equal Fig- 29-17. Eccentric riveted connection.
to

P
P, = n
where P = Total load on the joint
and n = No. of rivets on the joint.

2. Rotary displacement
All the rivets of the joint have also to offer resistance to the rotary displacement due to the load
P. Following two assumptions are made for finding out the resistance to the rotary displacement:

1. The force on a rivet, to be resisted, is proportional to the
distance of the centre of the rivet, from the centre of all
the rivets (i.e., centroid of the rivet system).

2. The direction of the force on a rivet, to be resisted, is
perpendicular to the line joining the centre of the rivet
and the centre of all the rivets (i.e., centroid of the rivet

system).
Now consider an eccentric riveted connection as shown

in Fig. 29.18.
Let P = Eccentric load on the

Fig. 29.18

joint
Eccentricity of the load i.e., the distance between the line of
action of the load and the centroid of the rivet system i.e., G.

is
ll

Consider a rivet at a distance r from the centroid of the rivet system G. The force to be resisted by
this rivet due to the moment of P x e (i.e., load x distance), is directly proportional to the distance
between its centre and G, i.e.,

= kr ...(i)
where k is a constant.
The moment of this resistance about G

= Ppxr=krxr=kr
and total moments of resistance by all the rivets about G

The direction of this force will be at right angles to the line joining the centre of the rivet and
centroid of the rivet system. Since, this force is directly proportional to r (as is clear from the relation)
therefore the rivet, which is at the farthest distance from the centroid of the rivet system, will be
subjected to the maximum force. It is thus obvious that while calculating the resistance of a rivet or
safety of the connection, a rivet which is at the farthest distance from G is studied, because all the
other rivets will be subjected to a lesser force than the farthest one.

The load P, is resolved horizontally as well as vertically. The resultant load on a rivet will be

given by the relation:

Note. Care should always be taken for the +ve or —ve sign. In general if the rivet, under consideration, is

between G and the load +ve sign is taken. But if the rivet is away from G, then —ve sign is taken.

29.27. Transmission of Load Through Rods

In the previous articles, we have discussed the transmission of load through plates. While
calculating the transmission of load through plate, we used to discuss the strength of a riveted joint.
Now we shall discuss the transmission of load through rods.

29.28. Types of Rod Joints

Though there are numerous types of joints in the rods, yet the following two types are important
from the subject point of view:
1. Knuckle joint and 2. Cotter joint

29.29. Knuckle Joint

A knuckle joint or forked joint is used to connect two rods or bars, subjected to tensile load. It
may be readily connected or disconnected for adjustments or repairs. The knuckle joints are very
common in machines and structures.

In a knuckle joint, one end of one of the rods is made into an eye and the other end of the other
rod is made into a fork, with an eye in each of the fork legs. A pin, having a head, is passed through
the eyes and fixed by means of a cotter pin as shown in Fig. 29.21.

= Diameter of the pin (or internal diameter of the eye),
6, = Permissible tensile strength in the rods,
6, = Permissible shear stress in the pin material and
6, = Permissible bearing stress for the pin material.

As a matter of facts, the above data is calculated for each joint. But sometimes, a few thumb rules
are adopted for the design of the various components of the joint as discussed below:

1. The diameter of the bars near the eyes, is made at least 5 mm more than the bar diameter.
2. The diameter of the pin head is made 1.5 times the diameter of the pin.
3. The outer diameter of the eye is made two times its internal diameter.

Now we shall find out the strength of the knuckle joint, in the same way, as we used to do in the
case of the riveted joints.

1. Strength of the rods
Since the rod is of uniform diameter, therefore strength of rod is taken for tensile load.

P= 6, x 7x D° (i)

2. Shearing strength of the pin

Since the pin is in double shear, therefore strength of the pin in double shear is taken.

P, = 2xtxtxd (ii)

3. Bearing strength of the pin

Since there is one pin only, therefore bearing strength of one pin is taken.

“ P, = 0,xXtxd (iii)
4. Tearing strength of the single eye

Since there is one hole only, therefore, tearing strength of the single eye with one hole is taken.

Oo P, = 0,(D)-a@t ..(iv)
The load, which the joint can carry is the least of the above four values.

Exampte 29.10. A knuckle joint is required to withstand a tensile load of 250 kN. Design
the important parts of the joint. Take T = SO MPa, 0, = 100 MPa and o, = 200 MPa.

29.30. Cotter Joint

A cotter joint is used to connect two rods or bars subjected to tensile or compressive loads. Like
a knuckle joint, a cotter joint may also be
readily connected or disconnected for
adjustments or repairs. The cotter joints are
widely used in various types of machines.

In a cotter joint, one end of one of the
rods is made *spigot and the other end of
the other rod is made a socket. A rectangular
hole is made in the spigot as well as socket.
A cotter which is nothing but a piece of plate
with one edge straight and the other tapered
from 1 in 24 to 1| in 48, is inserted into the
hole and tightened till the socket end comes
in contact with the spigot end as shown in
Fig. 29.23.

Fig. 29.23

* The end of the rod which goes inside is called a spigot and the other end of the other rod which receives
the spigot is called a socket.

Now consider a cotter joint connecting two rods as shown in Fig. 29.24.
Let P Load carried by the rods,
D = Diameter of the rods,

D, = Diameter of the spigot (or internal diameter of the socket),
D, = External diameter of the socket,

b = Width of the cotter at the axis of the rods,

t = Thickness of the cotter,
6, = Permissible tensile strength in the rods,

t = Permissible shear stress in the cotter material and

0, = Permissible bearing stress in the cotter material.

Fig. 29.24
As a matter of fact, the above data is calculated for each joint. But sometimes, a few thumb rules
are adopted for the design of the various components of the joint as discussed below:

1. The thickness of the cotter is made one-fourth of the diameter of the rods.

2. The diameter of the spigot (or internal diameter of the socket) is made 1.25 times the diameter
of the rods.

3. The external diameter of the socket is made 2.5 times the diameter of the rods.

Now we shall find out the strength of the cotter joint, in the same way as we used to do in the case
of riveted joints.

1. Strength of the rods
We know that the load on the rod,

P = 6, x TxD? mG)

2. Tearing strength of the spigot
Since the spigot is the weakest at a section on the hole for cotter, therefore tearing strength of the

spigot is taken at this section.

P= 9, (4 xD, ) -(D, 0 (ii)

3. Shear strength of the cotter

Since the cotter is in double shear, therefore strength of the cotter in double shear is taken.

4. Bearing strength of the cotter

Since there is one cotter only, therefore bearing strength of one cotter is taken.

“ P, = 0,XtxD, ...(iv)
5. Tearing strength of the socket

Since the socket is the weakest at a section on the hole for cotter, therefore tearing strength of the
socket is taken at this section.

30.1. Introduction

The welding is a process of joining together
two or more metal parts. It is done by heating the
surfaces, to be connected, to a high temperature
and then adding additional molten metal, which
fuses with and combines the two surfaces. The
molten or fused metal is deposited between the
parent metal parts, which are also fused to a
specified depth. When the deposited fused metal
gets cooled, the parent metal parts are joined by
this new metal.

A number of methods are used for the process
of fusion. But oxyacetylene gas welding and

Chapter 30 : Welded Joints m 723

electric arc welding are most commonly used. The welded joints have proved to be so reliable, that
they are replacing the riveted joints in structural and machine joints.

30.2. Advantages and Disadvantages of Welded Joints

Following are the advantages and disadvantages of welded joints over riveted joints:
Advantages

1. The welded structures are, usually, lighter than riveted structure. This is due to the reason, that
in welding gussets or other connecting components are not used.

2. The welding allows the arrangement of the structure components, in such a way, the joint pro-
vides maximum efficiency (may be 100%). But it is not possible in case of riveted joints.

3. Additions and alterations can be easily made in the existing structures.

4. As the welded structure is smooth in appearance, therefore it looks pleasing. Moreover, its
painting is easier and economical.

5. In welded connections, the tension members are not weakened as in the case of riveted or bolted
joint.

6. A welded joint has a great strength. Often a welded joint has the strength of the parent metal
itself.

7. Sometimes, the members are of such a shape (e.g., circular steel pipes) that they afford diffi-
culty for riveting. But they can be easily welded.

8. The welding provides very rigid joints. This is in line with the modern trend of providing rigid
frames.

9. Itis possible to weld any part of a structure at any point. But riveting requires enough clearance.

10. The noise produced in the process of riveting is a source of great nuisance. This is avoided in
the process of welding.

11. The process of welding takes less time than the riveting.
Disadvantages

1. As there is an uneven heating and cooling, during the fabrication, therefore the members may
get distorted or additional stresses may develop.

2. It requires a highly skilled labour and supervision.

»

As the welded joints are rigid joints, therefore they have to be treated as such in their design.

4. Since no provision is kept for expansion and contraction in the frame, therefore there is a pos-
sibility of cracks developing in it.

5. The inspection of welding work is more difficult than riveting work.

30.3. Types of Welded Joints

Though there are many types of welded joints, yet the following three types are important from
the subject point of view:

1. Butt weld point,
2. Fillet weld joint and
3. Plug or slot weld joint.

30.4. Butt Weld Joint

It is a joint, in which the edges of the two members butt (i.e., touch) against each other, the two
members are joined together by welding. It is used to make butt joint or the joint as shown in Fig.
30.1.

Fig. 30.1

The butt weld is generally made convex on

either sides. This extra area (which is about 10%)

of the plate is called reinforcement. The butt weld

joints are rarely used in engineering structures,
except for T-joints.

30.5. Fillet Weld Joint

It is a joint, in which the two members either
overlap or meet each other at about 90° and the
two members are joined together by welding. It is
of approximately triangular cross-section and is
used for overlap joints and corner joints as shown
in Fig. 30.2. The fillet weld joints are widely used in various types of engineering structures.

30.6. Plug or Slot Weld Joint

Sometimes, sufficient space is not available for providing the necessary length of the fillet weld.
In such cases, a circular hole is made, and a fillet weld is provided along the circumference of the
hole.

Sometimes, a circular hole or slotted hole is made in one of the members, and weld metal is filled
in the hole as shown in Fig. 30.3.

(b)

(a) (c)
Fillet weld Plug weld Slot weld

Fig. 30.3

Chapter 30 : Welded Joints m 725

The minimum diameter of the circular hole (or width of the slotted hole) should not be less than

(thickness of the member in mm + 8 mm) of the member containing the hole; whereas the maximum
diameter should not be more than 2.25 times the thickness of the member.

30.7. Technical Terms

discuss some of the technical terms, which are important from
the subject point of view.

1.

Before entering into the details of the welded joints, let us

Legs of the weld
The sides containing the right angle are called legs of the

weld. In Fig. 30.4, the sides AB and BC are called the Throat
legs of the weld. Fig. 30.4
Size of the fillet weld

The minimum length of the leg of a weld is called size of the weld. In Fig. 30.4, the side is
called size of the fillet weld.

Throat thickness

It is the perpendicular distance between the corner and hypotenuse of the weld cross-section as
shown in Fig. 30.4. The thickness of reinforcement is not included, in the throat thickness.
Effective throat thickness = k x minimum leg length.

The value of k for different angles between fusion faces is given below:

Angle 60° to 90° | 91° to 100° | 101° to 106° | 107° to 113° | 114° to 120°

k 0.7 0.65 0.60 0.55 0.50

Notes: 1. The fillet weld should not be used for connecting parts, whose fusion faces make an angle less than

4.

6.

60° or more than 120°.

2. If no angle between fusion faces is given, it is taken as 90° and the value of k is taken as 0.7.
Effective length of the weld
The actual length of the weld, which is of specified size and required thickness is called effec-
tive length of the weld. For the design purpose, the effective length of a weld is taken as the
actual length of the weld minus twice the size of the weld.
Side fillet weld
The fillet weld, placed parallel to the direction of the force is called a side fillet weld.
In Fig. 30.5, the welds A and C are the side
fillet welds.

End fillet weld

P P
The fillet weld placed at the end of the mem- PY

ber, so that it is perpendicular to the force is
called end fillet weld. In fig. 30.5, the weld B is

the end fillet weld. Fig. 30.5

30.8. Strength of a Welded Joint

We have already discussed the various types of welded joints. Now we shall discuss their strengths

(or in other words, forces of resistance), which are determined as given below:

1.

Butt weld joints

The strength of a butt weld is specified by its throat thickness, which is taken as the thickness of
the thinner plate. In a butt weld joint, it is assumed that the weld can sustain the full working

stresses in tension, compression and shear. The permissible stress in a butt weld, calculated on
throat area should not exceed the permissible stresses as given in table 30.1.

S.No. Nature of stress Permissible stress (0) in MPa (N/mm? )
1. Axial compression or tension 140
2. Fibre stress in bending 160

2. Fillet weld joint

The strength of a fillet weld is given by the relation :

3. Plug or slot weld joint
The strength of a plug or slot weld joint is given by the relation:

P=A-0
where A = Cross-sectional area of the plug or slot,
oO = Permissible stress in the weld as given in Table 30.1.

Note: Ifa fillet weld is provided, its length is taken to be equal to the average length of the throat of the fillet.
This length is, generally, taken to be equal to the length of the line running parallel to the vertical leg of
the weld, at a distance of one-fourth the leg from it. In case of circular hole, the length of the fillet is

taken as 1] d — 3 , where d is the diameter of the hole and h is the height of the vertical leg.

The maximum length of the weld is limited to 10 times of the throat thickness.

ExampLe 30.1. A tie bar is welded to a plate as shown in Fig. 30.6.

Find the strength of the weld. Take size of the fillet as 6 mm and working stress of the fillet weld
as 100 MPa.

From the geometry of the weld, we find that length of the fillet weld,
Z = 100+ 100 + 100 = 300 mm
and effective throat thickness, t = 0.7s=0.7x6=4.2 mm

We also know that effective throat thickness,
t = 0.7s=0.7x12=84mm

In such cases, the load is applied along the neutral axis of the unsymmetrical section; in order to
avoid the effect of eccentricity. A little consideration will show, that whenever an unsymmetrical
section is welded to a plate, the fillet weld is applied in such a way that the centre of gravity of the
weld lies on the line of action of the load. Or in other words, the centre of gravity of the weld coincides
with the neutral axis of the section.

30.10. Eccentric Welded Joints

In the previous articles, we have discussed the cases, where the weld has to resist only the linear
displacement of the plate or member connected. But, sometimes, a weld may have to offer resistance
to bending or torsion in addition to the linear displacement of the plate. Such welded connections are
called eccentric welded connections. Though there are many types of welded connections, yet the
following two are important from the subject point of view:

1. Eccentric welded joint subjected to moment, and
2. Eccentric welded joint subjected to torsion.

30.11. Eccentric Welded Joint Subjected to Moment

We have already discussed that if load or force acting on a welded joint, does not pass through
the centroid of the weld lines, it will cause some bending moment to the weld joint, in addition to the
direct load.

Now consider an eccentric welded connection for a bracket carrying a load as shown in Fig.
30.15. In this case, the moment (due to load ) is acting in a plane perpendicular to that of welds. A
little consideration will show that the weld has to offer resistance to the following two types of
displacements:

(a) Linear displacement, and (b) Horizontal displacement.

where 1 = Effective throat thickness and
! = Length of the total weld line.
(b) Resistance against horizontal displacement
The eccentric load will cause a moment,

where e = Eccentricity of the load.
This moment will cause tension in the weld at A and compression in the weld at B. The stress due
to this moment is given by the relation:

30.12. Eccentric Welded Joint Subjected to Torsion

In the previous article, we have discussed the eccentric welded joint subjected to bending moment.
But in this article, we shall discuss the eccentric welded joint subjected to torsion also. A bracket
connection is an example of this type of connection. Now consider an eccentric welded joint carrying
a load as shown in Fig. 30.18. In this case, the moment (due to load P) is acting in a plane containing
the welds. A little consideration will show that the weld has to offer resistance to the following two
types of displacements:

Chapter 30 : Welded Joints m= 737

Fig. 30.18
(a) Linear displacement and (b) Rotary displacement.
(a) Resistance against linear displacement
This resistance (or stress) is assumed to be uniform in all the weld lines and is equal to

Po
t-l
where t = Effective throat thickness and
! = Length of the total weld line.
(b) Resistance against rotary displacement
Following two assumptions are made for finding out the resistance against the rotary displacement:

(i) The force of resistance at any point in a weld is proportional to its distance from the centroid of
the weld lines.

(ii) The direction of the force of resistance is perpendicular to the line joining the point and the
centroid of the weld lines.

Now consider an eccentric welded connection as shown in Fig. 30.18.

Le P = Load acting on the connection,
e = Eccentricity of the load and
r = Distance between the centroid of the weld lines and the point,
where the resistance is required to be found out.
Twisting moment, T =P-e

and resistance against twisting or rotary displacement,

T P-e-r
where J is the polar moment of inertia and is equal to [yy + Iyy.
The direction of this force of resistance will be at right angles to the line joining the centroid of
weld lines and the point, where this resistance is required to be found out. This force is resolved
horizontally as well as vertically. The resultant force against rotary displacement will be given by the

relation:
_ | 2 2
R= (ZH) + (XV)

where XA = Horizontal component of P and
XV = R, = Vertical component of P.

The maximum force of resistance will occur at C and D because these points are at the farthest

31.1. Introduction

In engineering field, we daily come across
vessels of cylindrical and spherical shapes
containing fluids such as tanks, boilers,
compressed air receivers etc. Generally, the walls
of such vessels are very thin as compared to their
diameters. These vessels, when empty, are
subjected to atmospheric pressure internally as
well as externally. In such a case, the resultant
pressure on the walls of the shell is zero. But
whenever a vessel is subjected to internal pressure
(due to steam, compressed air etc.) its walls are
subjected to tensile stresses.

In general, if the thickness of the wall of a
shell is less than 1/10th to 1/15th of its diameter,
it is known as a thin shell.

Chapter 31 : Thin Cylindrical and Spherical Shells m= 743

31.2. Failure of a Thin Cylindrical Shell due to an Internal Pressure
We have already discussed in the last article that whenever a cylindrical shell is subjected to an
internal pressure, its walls are subjected to tensile stresses.

It will be interesting to know that if these stresses exceed the permissible limit, the cylinder is
likely to fail in any one of the following two ways as shown in Fig. 31.1 (a) and (b).

(a) Split into two troughs. (b) Split into two cylinders.

2. It may split up into two cylinders.

31.3. Stresses in a Thin Cylindrical Shell

We have already discussed that whenever a cylindrical shell is subjected to an internal pressure,
its walls are subjected to tensile stresses. A little consideration will show that the walls of the cylindri-
cal shell will be subjected to the following two types of tensile stresses:

1. Circumferential stress and
2. Longitudinal stress.

In case of thin shells, the stresses are assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout the wall
thickness. However, in case of thick shells, the stresses are no longer uniformly distributed and the
problem becomes complex. In this chapter, we shall discuss the stress in thin shells only.

Note: The above theory also holds good, when the shell is subjected to compressive stress.
31.4. Circumferential Stress

Consider the same cylindrical shell, subjected to the same internal pressure as shown in

to split into two pieces as shown in the figure.

EXAMPLE 31.1. A stream boiler of 800 mm diameter is made up of 10 mm thick plates. If the
boiler is subjected to an internal pressure of 2.5 MPa, find the circumferential and longitudinal
stresses induced in the boiler plates.

So.uTion. Given : Diameter of boiler (d) = 800 mm ; Thickness of plates (4) = 10 mm and

internal pressure (p) = 2.5 MPa = 2.5 N/mm’.

EXAMPLE 31.2. A cylindrical shell of 1.3 m diameter is made up of 18 mm thick plates. Find
the circumferential and longitudinal stress in the plates, if the boiler is subjected to an internal
pressure of 2.4 MPa. Take efficiency of the joints as 70%.

So.uTion. Given: Diameter of shell (d) = 1.3 m= 1.3 x 10° mm ; Thickness of plates () = 18

mm; Internal pressure (p) = 2.4 MPa = 2.4 N/mm” and efficiency (n) = 70% = 0.7.

ExamPLe 31.3. A gas cylinder of internal diameter 40 mm is 5 mm thick. If the tensile
stress in the material is not to exceed 30 MPa, find the maximum pressure which can be allowed

in the cylinder.
So.uTIoNn. Given: Diameter of cylinder (d) = 40 mm ; Thickness of plates (¢) = 5 mm and tensile

stress (6) = 30 MPa = 30 N/mm’,
p = Maximum pressure which can be allowed in the cylinder.

Let
We know that circumferential stress (6.),

Nore:1. Since the circumferential stress (0,,) is double the longitudinal stress (0,), therefore in order to find the
maximum pressure the given stress should be taken as circumferential stress.

Now we shall provide a pressure of 7.5 MPa i.e. (Lesser of the two values) obtained by using the tensile
stress as circumferential stress and longitudinal stress.

31.6. Design of Thin Cylindrical Shells

Designing of thin cylindrical shell involves calculating the thickness (t) of a cylindrical shell for
the given length (/), diameter (d), intensity of maximum internal pressure (p) and circumferential
stress (6,.). The required thickness of the shell is calculated from the relation.

t = ba ... (See Article 31.4)

If the thickness so obtained, is not a round figure, then next higher value is provided.
Note: The thickness obtained from the longitudinal stress will be half of the thickness obtained from circum-
ferential stress. Thus, it should not be accepted.

EXAMPLE 31.4. A thin cylindrical shell of 400 mm diameter is to be designed for an internal
pressure of 2.4 MPa. Find the suitable thickness of the shell, if the allowable circumferential
stress is 50 MPa.

So.uTIoNn. Given: Diameter of shell (d) = 400 mm ; Internal pressure (p) = 2.4 MPa = 2.4 N/mm?

and circumferential stress (6) = 50 MPa = 50 N/mm’.

pressure of 4 MPa. Find the minimum thickness of the shell, if maximum tensile strength in the
plate material is 400 MPa and efficiency of the joints is 65%. Take factor of safety as 5.

So.uTIon. Given: Diameter of shell (d) = 500 mm ; Internal pressure (p) = 4 MPa = 4 N/mm’;

Tensile strength = 400 MPa = 400 N/mm? ; Efficiency (n) = 65% = 0.65 and factor of safety = 5.

We know that allowable tensile stress (i.e., circumferential stress),

31.7. Change in Dimensions of a Thin Cylindrical Shell due to an
Internal Pressure
We have already discussed in the chapter on Elastic Constants that lateral strain is always accom-
panied by a linear strain. It is thus obvious that in a thin cylindrical shell subjected to an internal
pressure, its walls will also be subjected to lateral strain. The effect of the lateral strains is to cause

some change in the dimensions (i.e., length and diameter) of the shell. Now consider a thin cylindrical
shell subjected to an internal pressure.

Let l Length of the shell,
d = Diameter of the shell,
t Thickness of the shell and
Pp. = Intensity of the internal pressure.

31.8. Change in Volume of a Thin Cylindrical Shell due to an
Internal Pressure
We have already discussed in the last article, that there is always an increase in the length and
diameter of a thin cylindrical shell due to an internal pressure. A little consideration will show that
increase in the length and diameter of the shell will also increase its volume. Now consider a thin
cylindrical shell subjected to an internal pressure.

Let 1 = Original length,

Sometimes, boilers of the desired capacity are made
of cylindrical shape by joining different plates usually
by rivets. This is generally done : (i) by bending the
plates to the required diameter and then joining them by
a butt joint and (ii) by joining individually fabricated
shells by a lap joint as shown in Fig. 31.5 (a) and (b). A
little consideration will show that in this case, the plate is
weakened by the rivet hole.

Notes:1. If the efficiency of the joint is different i.e., the joint has different longitudinal efficiency and circum-
ferential efficiency, then the respective values should be used in the above relation.
2. For designing the shell i.e., determining the thickness of shell, the efficiency of the joint should also
be considered.

ExampLe 31.11. A boiler shell of 2 m diameter is made up of mild steel plates of 20 mm
thick. The efficiency of the longitudinal and circumferential joints is 70% and 60% respectively.
Determine the safe pressure in the boiler, if the permissible tensile stress in the plate section
through the rivets is 100 MPa. Also determine the circumferential stress in the plate and longitu-
dinal stress through the rivets.

31.12. Wire-Bound Thin Cylindrical Shells

Sometimes, we have to strengthen a cylindrical shell against bursting in longitudinal section
(i.e., due to hoop or circumferential stress). This is done by winding a wire under tension, closely
round the shell as shown in Fig. 31.6. Its effect will be to put the cylinder wall under initial com-

pressive stress.

Fig. 31.6
A little consideration will show that now if the internal pressure of the shell is increased, the
bursting force will be resisted jointly by the shell section and the wires. It is thus obvious that a wire-
bound shell can withstand a greater internal pressure than an ordinary shell. In actual practice the
winding wire is made of a high tensile material.

=50N/mm’=50MPa Ans.

Oo, =

—

In such cases, the bursting force (due to internal pressure) per cm length is equal to the resisting
force (due to pipe section + wire section). The circumferential strain in the pipe is also equal to the
strain in the steel wire. The following example will illustrate the above mentioned statements.

Example 31.12. A cast iron pipe of 300 mm internal diameter and 12 mm thick is wound

closely with a single layer of circular steel wire of 5 mm diameter under a tension of 60 MPa.
Find the initial compressive stress in the pipe section. Also find the stresses set up in the pipe and
steel wire, when water under a pressure of 4 MPa is admitted into the pipe.

Take E for cast iron and steel as 100 GPa and 200 GPa respectively. Poisson’s ratio = 0.3.

So.uTIon. Given: Diameter of pipe (d) = 300 mm ; Pipe Thickness (t) = 12 mm ; Diameter of
wire = 5 mm ; Tension in wire = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm? ; Pressure of water (p) = 4 MPa = 4 N/mm? 5
Modulus of elasticity for cast iron (E.) = 100 GPa = 100 x 10° N/mm? ; Modulus of elasticity for

1
steel (E,) = 200 GPa = 200 x 10° N/mm and poisson’s ratio (+) = 0.3.

Initial compressive stress in the pipe section

A little consideration will show that the pipe will be subjected to compression (due to tension in
the wire), before the water under pressure is admitted into the pipe. Now consider one mm length of
the pipe. We know that number of wire sections for | mm pipe length

32.1. Introduction

In the last chapter, we have discussed thin
cylindrical and spherical shells. We have studied
that in a thin shell, the stresses are assumed to
be uniformly distributed throughout the wall
thickness. But it is not so in the case of thick
shells, and it varies with the thickness.

Thick shells are, generally, used to withstand
high pressures. Sometimes, even, compound thick
shells are used to withstand very high pressures
or to contain chemicals under high pressure.

32.2. Lame’s Theory

The problem of thick cylinders is somewhat
complex and is solved on the following
assumptions:

756 om Strength of Materials

1. The material of the shell is homogeneous and isentropic.

2. The plane sections of the cylinder, perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, remain plane under
the effect of pressure i.e. the longitudinal strain is constant and is independent of the radius
of the shell.

The theory derived after the above mentioned assumptions is popularly known as Lame’s Theory.

32.3. Stresses in a Thick Cylindrical Shell

Consider a thick cylindrical shell subjected to an internal pressure as shown in Fig. 32.1 (a).

Let r, = Outer radius of the cylinder,
ry = Inner radius of the cylinder, and
l = Length of the cylinder.

Now consider an elementary ring of the cylinder of thickness dx, and of a radius x as shown
Fig. 32.1 (a) and (5).

Let P,, = Intensity of pressure on the inside of the ring
(p,.+ dp,) = Intensity of pressure on the outside of the ring and
6, = Intensity of hoop stress induced in the ring.
We know that the bursting force on any longitudinal section say (X—X),
P = p,: 2xl—(p, + dp,) > 2x + dx)l (0)
and resisting force = 0,:2-dx-l ...(il)

Since the bursting force is equal to the resisting force, therefore equating (i) and (ii),
0,:2-dx-l = p,- 2xl-(p, + dp,)- 2(x + dx)l
0,:dx = p,-x—(p,-x+p,- dx + dp... x + dp; dx)

Now let us obtain another relation between radial pressure (p,) and hoop stress (0,) in order to
solve the above equation with the help of the assumption in Lame’s theory i.e. the longitudinal strain
is constant. The equation given in this theory for longitudinal tensile stress,

equations.

due to pressure inside the thick cylinder.

32.4. Stresses in Compound Thick Cylindrical Shells

We have already discussed in Art. 25.10 that in order to withstand a very high pressure, the thin
cylindrical shell is wound with a wire under tension. The effect of the wire is to put the cylinder wall
under an initial compressive stress. The same principle is used in thick cylindrical shells. This is done
by shrinking one thick shell over another. A little consideration will show, that the outer shell will
produce some initial compressive stress in the inner one. The inner shell, in turn, will exert some
tensile stress in the outer one. This principle is commonly used in the design of gun tube.

760 Strength of Materials

Now when the compound shell is subjected to an internal pressure, both the inner and outer
shells will be subjected to hoop tensile stress. The net effect of the initial
stresses and those due to internal pressure is to make the resultant stresses
more or less uniform.

Now consider a compound thick cylindrical shell made up of two tubes
as shown in Fig. 32.3.

Let r, = Outer radius of the outer shell,
ry = Inner radius of the inner shell,
r,; = Outer radius of the inner shell, (also > r, ig!
inner radius of the outer shell), — 1
and m
P, = Radial pressure at the junction of the Fig. 32.3

two shells (i.e., at radius r,)
Now the Lame’s equations may be applied in this case for the initial conditions (i.e., when the
outer tube exerts pressure on the inside shell, or in other words before the fluid under pressure is
admitted into the inner shell.

The values of a,, b,, a, and b, may be found out from the above four equations, if the radial
pressure p, at the junction of the two shells is known. The hoop stress (6 ,,) may also be obtained with
the help of relative expressions.

Now, when the fluid under pressure (p) is admitted inside the compound shell it will be resisted
jointly by both the shells. The hoop stresses may be calculated by the Lame’s formulae as usual. The
resultant stresses will be the algebraic sum of the initial stresses an those due to fluid pressure.

EXAMPLE 32.3. A compound cylinder is made by shrinking a tube of 160 mm internal diameter

and 20 mm thick over another tube of 160 mm external diameter and 20 mm thick. The radial
pressure at the common surface, after shrinking, is 8 N/mm”. Find the final stresses set up across
the section, when the compound cylinder is subjected to an internal fluid pressure of 60 N/mm’.

internal fluid pressure in the compound cylinder (p,) = 60 N/mm?.

Outer diameter of outer cylinder = 160 + 20 + 20 = 200 mm

32.5. Difference of Radii of Shrinkage

We have discussed in the last article, that in the case of compound cylinders the outer shell is
shrunk, over the inner one, to produce some initial compressive stress in the inner shell. This is done
by making the inner diameter of the outer tube slightly less than the outer diameter of the inner tube.
Then the outer cylinder is heated and the inner cylinder is inserted into it. After cooling, the outer
cylinder shrinks over the inner one. sometimes, the inner cylinder is also forced into the outer one
with the help of machines to obtain the necessary grip or initial stresses. This principle is used in
fixing sleeves in automobile engine heads.

Let r, = Outer radius of the outer shell,

ry = Inner radius of the inner shell, and
r; = Common radius of the outer shell at the junction after
shrinking.

A little consideration will show, that * before shrinking, the outer radius of the inner shell is
slightly more than r, and inner radius of the outer shell is slightly less than r,.

Now Lame’s equations may be applied in this case also. Therefore at the junction, the radial
pressure, (p,) is the same for the shells.

First of all, consider the inner tube. From the geometry of the figure, we find that when

then p,=0. Also when x = 80 mm, then p, =p, (where p, is the radial pressure at the junction).

= Radius of curvature of the bar.

774 @ Strength of Materials

The above mentioned formula is, sometimes, called straight-beam formula. The reason for the
same is that it can be applied, with sufficient accuracy, to the beams only with small initial curvature.

33.2. Assumptions for the Stresses in the Bending of Curved Bars

The stresses in the bending of curved bars are determined on the following assumptions :
1. The bar material is stressed within the elastic limit, and thus obeys Hooke’s law.
2. The transverse sections, which were plane before bending, remain plane after bending also.

3. The longitudinal fibres of the bar, parallel to the central axis, exert no pressure on each
other.

4. The transverse cross-section has at least one axis of symmetry, and the bending moment lies
on this plane.
5. The value of E (i.e., modulus of elasticity) is the same in tension and compression.

33.3. Types of Curved Bars on the Basis of Initial Curvature

The curved bars may be broadly grouped into the following two categories on the basis of their
initial curvature :

1. Bars with a small initial curvature, and

2. Bars with a large initial curvature.

The main characteristic of the above division is the ratio of the depth of bar section (i) to the initial
radius of curvature (R). If this ratio (i.e., H/R) is 0.2 or less, the bar is considered to be of small initial
curvature. But if this ratio is more than 0.2, the bar is considered to be of large radius of curvature.

Now we shall discuss the effect of bending of both the above types of bars in the following pages.

33.4. Bars with a Small Initial Curvature

Fig. 33.1
Consider a curved bar with a small initial curvature as shown in Fig. 33.1(a). Let the bar be given
more curvature after the application of the end moments as shown in Fig. 33.1 (b).

Let R_ = Initial radius of curvature of the bar,
R, = Final radius of curvature,
8 = Initial angle subtended at the centre by the bar, and
(8 + 50) = Final angle subtended at the centre of the bar.

Chapter 33 : Bending of Curved Bars m 775

Now consider a layer PQ, which has been bent up to P’ Q”’ after bending. Let y be the distance of
the layer PQ from RS, the neutral axis of the bar. We know that increase in the length of the bar,

From the geometry of the bar, we find that
RS = RO and R’S’ = R, (0 + 68).
Since RS is equal to R’S’ (being neutral axis) therefore,

RO = R, (0+ 60)=R,0+ R,- 50
R,-80 = RO-R,O=0(R-R,)

In the previous article, we have discussed a case of bars with a small initial curvature (i.e. assuming

rings etc., which have large initial curvature. The analysis of such bars was first dealt with Winkler
and later by Andrews and Pearson.

33.11. Crane Hooks

We have already discussed in Art. 33.5 the values of
bending stress, due to moment in bars with a large initial
curvature. The results of this article may be applied for finding
the stresses in the horizontal section (X,X,) through the centre
of curvature (O) of a hook, when it is subjected to a load. A
little consideration will show, that the horizontal section
through the centre of curvature is the most stressed section.

Now the stresses at the inner (X,) and the outer (X,) may
be found out by determining the bending stresses at these
points, and then adding the direct stresses due to the load W.
Since the bending moment M tends to increase the curvature,
therefore the bending stress at X, is tensile, and that at X, is
compressive. Thus the total stress at X,.

Columns and
Struts

34.1. Introduction

A structural member, subjected to an axial
compressive force, is called a strut. As per defi-
nition, a strut may be horizontal, inclined or even
vertical. But a vertical strut, used in buildings or
frames, is called a column.

34.2. Failure of a Column or Strut

It has been observed, that when a column or
a strut is subjected to some compressive force,
then the compressive stress induced,

oul
A
where P = Compressive force and

A = Cross-sectional area of the column.

796 wm Strength of Materials

A little consideration will show, that if the force or load is gradually increased the column will
reach a stage, when it will be subjected to the ultimate crushing stress. Beyond this stage, the column
will fail by crushing. The load corresponding to the crushing stress, is called crushing load.

It has also been experienced that sometimes, a compression member does not fail entirely by
crushing, but also by bending i.e., buckling. This happens in the case of long columns. It has also been
observed that all the short columns fail due to their crushing. But, if a long column is subjected to a
compressive load, it is subjected to a compressive stress. If the load is gradually increased, the col-
umn will reach a stage, when it will start buckling. The load, at which the column just buckles is
called buckling load, criticial load or crippling load and the column is said to have developed an
elastic instability. A little consideration will show that for a long column, the value of buckling load
will be less than the crushing load. Moreover, the value of buckling load is low for long columns and
relatively high for short columns.

34.3. Euler’s Column Theory

The first rational attempt, to study the stability of “long columns, was made by Mr. Euler. He
derived an equation, for the buckling load of long columns based on the bending stress. While deriv-
ing this equation, the effect of direct stress is neglected. This may be justified with the statement that
the direct stress induced in a long column is negligible as compared to the bending stress. It may be
noted that the Euler’s formula cannot be used in the case of short columns, because the direct stress is
considerable and hence cannot be neglected.

34.4. Assumptions in the Euler’s Column Theory
The following simplifying assumptions are made in the Euler’s column theory:
Initially the column is perfectly straight and the load applied is truly axial.
The cross-section of the column is uniform throughout its length.
The column material is perfectly elastic, homogeneous and isotropic and thus obeys Hooke’s law.
The length of column is very large as compared to its cross-sectional dimensions.

The shortening of column, due to direct compression (being very small) is neglected.

Awe & NP

The failure of column occurs due to buckling alone.

34.5. Sign Conventions

Though there are different signs used for the bending of columns in different books, yet we shall
follow the following sign conventions which are commonly used and internationally recognised.

(a) Positive (b) Negative

shown in Fig. 34.1 (a) is taken as positive.

2. A moment, which tends to bend the column with its concavity towards its initial central line as
shown in Fig. 34.1 (b) is taken as negative.

34.6. Types of End Conditions of Columns

In actual practice, there are a number of end conditions, for columns. But, we shall study the
Euler’s column theory on the following four types of end conditions, which are important from the
subject point of view:

1. Both ends hinged,

2. Both ends fixed,

3. One end is fixed and the other hinged, and
4. One end is fixed and the other free.

Now we shall discuss the value of critical load for all the above mentioned type of and conditions
of columns one by one.

34.7. Columns with Both Ends Hinged

Consider a column AB of length / hinged at both of its ends A and B and
carrying a critical load at B. As a result of loading, let the column deflect into a
curved form AX,B as shown in Fig. 34.2.

Now consider any section X, at a distance x from A.
Let P = Critical load on the column,
y = Deflection of the column at xX.

34.11. Euler’s Formula and Equivalent length of a Column

In the previous articles, we have derived the relations for the crippliing load under various end
conditions. Sometimes, all these cases are represented by a general equation called Euler’s formula,
nu El
= 2
E L,

where L, is the equivalent or effective length of column.

The is another way of representing the equation, for the crippling load by an equivalent length
of effective length of a column. The equivalent length of a given column with given end conditions,
is the length of an equivalent column of the same material and cross-section with both ends hinged
and having the value of the crippling load equal to that of the given column.

Nore. The vertical column will have two moments of inertia (viz., Jyy and Ly,). Since the column will tend to
buckle in the direction of leas moment of inertia, therefore the least value of the two moments of inertia
is to be used in tlhe relation.

34.12. Slenderness Ratio
We have already discussed in Art. 34.11 that the Euler’s formula for the crippling load,
n° EI
P, = a 5 ..(1)

We know that the buckling of a column under the crippling load will take place about the axis of
least resistance. Now substituting / = Ak? (where A is the area and k is the least radius of gyration of
the section) in the above equation,

L, ~ (4 ) ... (il)
ke

where — is known as slenderness ratio. Thus slenderness ratio is defined as ratio of equivalent (or

unsupported) length of column to the least radius of gyration of the section.
Slenderness ratio does not have any units.
Nore. It may be noted that the formula for crippling load, in the pervious articles, have been derived on the

L. .
assumption the the slenderness ratio " is so large, that the failure of the column occurs only due to

bending, the effect of direct stress (i.e., *) being negligible.

34.13. Limitation of Euler’s Formula
We have discussed in Art. 32.12 that the Euler’s formula for the crippling load,

mn EA
Py, = L, 2
k
Euler’s crippling stress,
P_wWE

A little consideration will show that the crippling
stress will be high, when the slenderness ratio is small.
We know that the crippling stress for a column cannot
be more than the crushing stress of the column mate-
rial. It is thus obvious that the Euler’s formula will
give the value of crippling stress of the column (equal
to the crushing stress of the column material) corre-
sponding to the slenderness ratio. Now consider a mild
steel column. We know that the crushing stress for the
mild steel is 320 MPa or 320 N/m? and Young’s modu-
lus for the mild steel is 200 GPa or 200 x 10° N/mm?.

Now equating the crippling stress to the crushing stress,

WE _ x x(200x10°)

320 =

804 sm Strength of Materials

€

(+) nx 200x10°

k 320
or “t = 78.5 say 80

Thus, if the slenderness ratio is less than 80 the Euler’s formula for a mild steel column is not
valid.

Sometimes, the columns, whose slenderness ratio is more than 80 are known as long columns
and those whose slenderness ratio is Jess than 80 are known as short columns. It is thus obvious that
the Euler’s formula holds good only for long columns.

Note. In the Euler’s formula, for crippling load, we have not taken into account the direct stresses induced in
the material due to the load, (which increases gradually from zero to its crippling value). As a matter of
fact, the combined stress, due to direct load and slight bending reaches its allowable value at a load, lower
than that required for buckling ; and therefore this will be the limiting value of the safe load.

34.14. Empirical Formulae for Columns

We have already discussed in the previous articles that the
Euler’s formula is valid only for long columns i.e., for columns,
whose slenderness ratio is greater than a certain value for a
particular material. Moreover, it does not take into consideration
the direct compressive stress. In order to fill up this lacuna, many
more formulae were proposed by different scientists all over the
world. The following empirical formulae, out of those, are
important from the subject point of view.

1. Rankine’s formula,
2. Johnson’s formula, and
3. Indian Standard code.

34.15. Rankine’s Formulae for Columns

We have already discussed that the Euler’s formula gives
correct results only for very long columns. Though this formula is
applicable for columns, ranging from very long to short ones, yet
it does not give reliable results. Prof. Rankine, after a number of experiments, gave the following
empirical formula for columns.

a dyt
where P, = Crippling load by Rankine’s Formula
Pcs = Ocs:A = Ultimate crushing load for the column and
nm EI
Pr = “L2 = Crippling load obtained by Euler’s formula.

e

A little consideration will show that the value of P.., will remain constant irrespective of the fact
whether the column is a long one or short one. Now, we shall study the effect of P,, in short as well as
long columns one by one.

1. Short columns. In case of short columns, the value of P,, will be very high, therefore the value

1 1
of Pp will be quite negligible as compared to p_ . It is thus obvious that the Rankine’s formula

ey
will give the value of its crippling load (i.e., P) approximately equal to the ultimate crushing
load (i.e., ).

2. Long columns. In case of long columns, the value of P,, will be very small, therefore the value

1 1
of p_ will be quite considerable as compared to p_. It is thus obvious that the Rankine’s

formula will give the value of its crippling load (i.e., P) approximately equal to the crippling
load by Euler’s formula (i.e., P,). Thus, we see that the Rankine’s formula gives a fairly correct
result for all cases of columns, ranging from short to long columns.

34.16. Johnson’s Formula for Columns

Prof. Johnson, after a series of experiments and observations, proposed the following two formu-
lae for columns:
1. Straight line formula and
2. Parabolic formula

34.17. Johnson’s Straight Line Formula for Columns

This formula was first proposed by Johnson, which states

where P = Safe load on the column,
A = Area of the column cross-section,
Oc = Allowable compressive stress in the column material,

n = Aconstant, whose value depends upon the column
material and

= Slenderness ratio.

A little consideration will show that for short columns that safe load P= 6, - A.

But for long columns, there is always a possibility of buckling. It is thus obvious, that the safe
load will be small, depending upon the slenderness ratio.

Prof. Johnson, while analysing the safe load, used to plot a curve for ‘ and vA . Since he used to

get a straight line in this case, so he named this formula as a straight line formula.

34.20. Long Columns Subjected to Eccentric Loading

In the previous articles, we have discussed
the effect of loading on long columns. We have
always referred the cases when the load acts
axially on the column (i.e., the line of action of

the load coincides with the axis of the column). |.

But in actual practice it is not always possible

to have an axial load, on the column, and eccen-

tric loading takes place. Here we shall discuss
the effect of eccentric loading on the Rankine’s
and Euler’s formulae for long columns.

35.1. Introduction

We have discussed in Art. 14.3 that whenever
a beam is loaded, the upper layers (from the
neutral axis) of the beam are in compression;
whereas the lower ones are in tension. It has been
experimentally found that the cement concrete is
very weak in tension, though it is strong in
compression. It has also been observed that the
steel is equally strong in tension and compression.
But a little consideration will show that a long
steel bar can resist tension up to the permissible
limit; whereas it cannot resist compression up to
the permissible limit because of buckling.

The engineers have taken the full advantages
of concrete in compression and steel in tension,
by combination, which proved to be an ideal
(because the two materials are used to take up the

822 mm Strength of Materials

stresses, for which they are most suitable) is called reinforced cement concrete (briefly written as
R.C.C.).

35.2. Advantages of R.C.C. Structures

The following advantages of R.C.C. structures are important from the subject point of view:
1. The concrete, while setting holds a firm grip on the surface of the steel bars.

The coefficient of linear expansions for steel and concrete are almost the same. Therefore no
internal stresses are set up due to variation in temperature.

3. The coating of cement grout on the surface of steel bars, protects them from corrosion and thus
does not produce adverse chemical effects on them.

35.3. Assumptions in the Theory of R.C.C.

The following assumptions are made in the theory of reinforcement cement concrete.
All the tensile stresses are taken up by the steel reinforcement only.
There is a sufficient bond between the steel and concrete.
The moduli of elasticity for steel and concrete are constant.

PYe NP

The steel and concrete is stressed within its elastic limit and thus obey Hooke’s law.

35.4. Neutral Axis

It is an imaginary plane, which divides the cross-section of a beam into the tension and compres-
sion zones on the opposite sides of the plane.

35.5. Types of Neutral Axis
There are two types of neutral axis of reinforced concrete section:
1. Critical neutral axis and
2. Actual neutral axis.

35.6. Critical Neutral Axis

The critical neutral axis, of a section is based on the principle that the neutral axis is situated at
the centre of gravity of a given section. The depth of critical neutral axis from the top of section may
be derived from the first principles and is useful, where the stresses in the concrete and steel are
known.

35.7. Actual Neutral Axis

The actual neutral axis of a section, is based on the principle that the moment of areas on either
side of it (i.e., areas of compression and tension zones) are equal. Since a reinforced section is com-
posed of two dissimilar materials, therefore one of these two materials must be converted into an
equivalent section composed of only one material. The general practice is to convert the area of
reinforcement into an equivalent area of concrete, by multiplying it by the modular ratio.

The moment of resistance of a reinforced section /k—— b —>
is the moment of the couple consisting of the total Ff
tensile force in the steel reinforcement (acting at the n
centre of the reinforcement) and the compressive force = _ L ee
in the concrete (acting at the centre of gravity of the d
compressive forces), as shown in Fig. 35.3.

In order that the section may be stable under the
action of the external bending moment, the total -- --f.
moment of resistance should not be less than the
external bending moment.

Let b = Width of the beam, Fig. 35.3
d = Effective depth of the beam and
n = Depth of the neutral axis, from the top of the beam.
Lever arm = d -3

EXAMPLE 35.3. A beam 250 mm wide and 550 mm deep contains 4 no. 12 mm dia bars. The
cover of concrete, to the centre of the main reinforcement is 50 mm. Find the moment of resis-
tance of the beam, if maximum allowable stresses in concrete and steel are 4.2 MPa and 125

So.uTion. Given: Width of beam (b) = 250 mm ; Overall depth of beam = 550 mm ; Cover of
concrete over reinforcement = 50 mm ; No. of bars = 4 ; Diameter of bars = 12 mm; Allowable stress in

From the above two values, we find that the moment of resistance of the beam is 25.64 x 10°
N-mm (i.e., lesser of the two values). Ans.

Note: In this case, the steel develops a maximum stress of 125 N/mm”. But the concrete is not stressed to its
allowable stress of 4.2 N/mm’.

ExampPLe 35.4. A reinforced concrete beam of 250 mm width and 600 mm effective depth is
subjected to a bending moment of 120 kN-m. The reinforcement consists of 4 bars of 28 mm

35.9. Types of Beam Sections
The beam sections are of the following three types, depending upon the amount of reinforce-
ment:
1. Under-reinforced section,
2. Balanced section and
3. Over-reinforced section.

35.10. Under-reinforced Section

It is a section, in which the amount of reinforcement is Jess than the proper requirement. As a
result of this, the steel will first attain the maximum permissible stresses and the concrete will not be
subjected to full compressive stresses. In this case, the depth of actual neutral axis will be Jess than
that of the critical neutral axis.

828 m Strength of Materials

The moment of resistance of an under-reinforced beam is based on the stresses in steel and will
be given by the relation,

MR. = 1A(a-2)

35.11. Balanced Section

It is a section, in which the amount of reinforcement is equal to the proper requirement. In a
balanced beam, the steel as well as concrete will attain maximum permissible stresses simultaneously.
In this case, the depth of actual neutral axis will be the same as that of the critical neutral axis.

The amount of resistance, of a balanced beam will be based on the stress in steel as well as
concrete and will be given by the relations:

35.12. Over-reinforced Section

It is a section, in which the amount of reinforcement is more than the proper requirement. As a
result of this, the concrete will first attain the maximum permissible stresses and the steel will not be
subjected to full tensile stress. In this case, the depth of actual neutral axis will be more than the
critical neutral axis.

and steel are 70 MPa and 140 MPa respectively. Take m = 15.

So.uTion. Given : Width of beam (b) = 250 mm ; Effective depth of beam (d) = 330 mm; Area

Since the depth of actual neutral axis (146.1 mm) is more than the critical neutral axis (141.4

mum permissible stress. And the moment of resistance will be based on the stress in concrete. We

Notes :1. This reinforcement is equivalent to 4 bars of 20 mm diameter.
2. Since the steel and concrete is fully stressed, therefore look the neutral axes (1.e., actual and critical)
will coincide with each other.
Example 35.7. A reinforced concrete beam of 300 mm width and 600 mm overall depth has
a 50 mm cover over the bottom reinforcement. The beam is subjected to a load of 24 kN/m
including itself weight for a span of 6 m. If the allowable stress in the concrete is 5 MPa, deter-
mine the corresponding stress in steel.

Also determine the area of reinforcement. Take m = 15.

So.uTIon. Given : Width of beam (b) = 300 mm ; Overall depth = 600 mm ; Cover over the

35.13. Design of Beams and Slabs

We have already discussed in the previous articles, that a given section may be under-reinforced,
balanced or over-reinforced. We have also discussed that in an under reinforced section, the steel will
first attain the maximum permissible stress, whereas the concrete will not be subjected to the full
compressive stress. Similarly, in an over-reinforced section, the concrete will first attain the maxi-
mum permissible stress, whereas the steel will not be subjected to the full tensile stress. But in a
balanced section, the stresses in concrete as well as steel are developed to the maximum permissible
limit. It is thus obvious that the beams and slabs should be designed as balanced sections, so that the
section is not wasteful. Such designs are also called “economical design.

It has been experimentally found that the maximum permissible stresses in steel and concrete
depend upon the type and ratio of cement aggregates, water etc. But in general, the following stresses
are adopted for the design of beams and slabs:

Allowable stress in steel, t = 140 N/mm?

Allowable stress in concrete, c = 5 N/mm?

Modular ratio, m = 18
Now consider a beam reinforced at its bottom and subjected to some loading.
Let b = Width of the beam,
d = Effective depth of the beam, and
n = Depth of neutral axis from the top of the beam.

(In a design, the depths of actual neutral axis and
the critical neutral axis is the same).

Nortes:1. Sometimes the allowable stresses in steel and concrete as well as modular ratio is different than those
assumed above. In such cases, the value of n and M [as obtained in equations (7) and (ii)] will be

2. The bottom reinforcement is given a concrete cover, in order to embed the bars. The general thickness
of the cover in beams 40 mm to 60 mm, whereas in slabs it is 2 cm and 3 cm.

3. The slabs are designed for 1 metre width and the same design is carried for the whole slab.

36.1. Introduction

In modern design offices, a special care is taken
at the time of designing a structure that it should be
able to withstand the stresses, under the various load
conditions, without failure. For doing so, it is very
essential to have a complete information about the
various properties of the selected material and its
dimensions. This information can be obtained by
experimental investigations in a well-equipped
material testing laboratory.

36.2. Classification of Materials

In general all the materials, used by the
engineers, may be classified on the basis of their
physical properties into the following four

types:

836 m Strength of Materials

. Elastic materials,
. Plastic materials,
. Ductile materials, and

mh Ww NY =

. Brittle materials

36.3. Elastic Materials

We have already discussed that whenever some external system of forces acts on a body, it
undergoes some deformation. The deformation increases as the forces increase. If a material regains
its original position, on the removal of the external forces, it is called an elastic material.

36.4. Plastic Materials

If a material does not regain its original position, on the removal of the external forces, it is called
a plastic material.

36.5. Ductile Materials

If a material cannot undergo a considerable deformation, without rupture (e.g. if a material can
be drawn into wires), it is called a ductile material.

36.6. Brittle Material

If a material cannot undergo any deformation (like glass, china-ware, etc.) when some external
forces act on it and it fails by rupture, it is called a brittle material.

36.7. Classification of Tests

The various tests carried out, in a material testing laboratory, to know the physical properties of
a material, may be grouped under the following three headings :—

1. Types of stress induced

The tests are carried out by inducing the various types of stresses (i.e., tensile stress, compressive
stress, shear stress, torsional stress, etc.)

2. The rate, at which, the stresses are induced

The tests are also carried by inducing the stresses at different rates. In general, the stresses induced
under this heading are gradual and sudden (i.e. impact tests).

3. The number of times, the stresses are induced

The tests are also carried out by inducing the stresses once, and a number of times.

36.8. Actual Tests for the Mechanical Properties of Materials
Though there are many tests, which are carried out to know the strength of material, yet the
following tests are important from the subject point of view:
1. Tensile test
2. Compressive test
3. Impact test
4. Fatigue test.

36.9. Tensile Test of a Mild Steel Specimen

We have studied in Chapter 2, that whenever some external system of forces acts on a body, it
undergoes some deformation. If a body is stressed within its elastic limit, the deformation entirely

Chapter 36 : Mechanical Properties of Materials m 837

disappears as soon as the forces are removed. It has been also found that beyond the elastic limit, the
deformation does not disappear entirely, even after the removal of the forces and there remains some
residual deformation. We study this phenomenon, in a greater detail, by referring to a tensile test (or
stress-strain diagram) for a mild steel bar.

\¢- Gauge length|

Fig. 36.1

Take a specimen of mild steel bar of uniform section as shown in Fig. 36.1. Let this bar be
subjected to a gradually increasing pull (as applied by
universal testing machine). If we plot the stresses along
the vertical axis, and the corresponding strains along the
horizontal axis and draw a curve passing through the
vicinity of all such points, we shall obtain a graph as shown
in Fig. 36.2.

We see, from the graph, that the curve from O to A is
a straight line, which represents that the stress is
proportional to strain. Beyond A, the curve slightly
deviates from the straight. It is thus obvious, that the
Hooke’s law holds good only up to this limit. Thus the
point A is the elastic limit of the specimen metal. When
the specimen is stressed beyond this limit, the strain
increases more quickly than the stress (in comparison from
O to A). This happens, because a sudden elongation of
the specimen takes place, without an appreciable increase
in the stress (or load). The stress, corresponding to the
point B is called the yield point.* It may be noted, that if
the load on the specimen is removed, then the elongation
from A to B will not disappear. But will remain as a
permanent set. It is thus obvious, that the Hooke’s law
does not hold good, beyond the point A (i.e., elastic limit) Fig. 36.2

At B, the specimen regains some strength and higher values of stresses are required, for higher
strains, than those between A and B. The stress (or load) goes on increasing, till the point C is reached.
The gradual increase in the length of the specimen is followed with the uniform reduction of its cross-
sectional area. The work done, during stretching the specimen, is transformed largely into heat and the
specimen becomes hot. At C, the stress, which attains its maximum value, is known as ultimate stress.

Stress —>

After the specimen has reached the ultimate stress, a neck is formed, which decreases the cross-
sectional area of the specimen. A little consideration will show, that the stress (or load) necessary, to
break away the specimen, is less than the ultimate stress (or maximum load). The stress is, therefore,
reduced until the specimen breaks away at the stress represented by the point D. The stress,
corresponding to the point D, is known as the breaking stress.**

* At this point, the elongation of a mild steel specimen is about 2%.

** — The breaking stress (i.e., stress at E which is less than that at D, appears to be somewhat misleading. As the
formation of a neek takes place at D, which reduces the cross-sectional area. It causes the specimen suddenly
to fail at E. If for each value of the strain between C and E the tensile load is divided by the reduced cross-
sectional area at the narrowest part of the neck, then the true stress-strain curve will follow the dotted line
C.F. However, it is an established practice, to calculate strains on the basis of original cross-sectional area
of the specimen.

838 m Strength of Materials
36.10. Working Stress

The stress-strain curve gives a valuable information about the mechanical properties of a metal.
By knowing the elastic limit, yield point and ultimate stress in a material, it is very easy to establish
the magnitude of stress, which can be safely undertaken by it. This is, generally, done by keeping the
safe stress well below the elastic limit. This safe stress, which is allowed to be undertaken by the
material in designs, is called the working stress.

36.11. Factor of Safety

The ratio of elastic limit to the working stress (or ultimate stress to the working stress) is called
the factor of safety. In the recent days, the general practice followed is, that for structural steel work
(when subjected to gradually increasing loads) the factor of safety is taken as the ratio of elastic limit
to the working stress; whose value is taken as 2 to 2.5. But in the case of cast iron, concrete, wood,
etc. (or when structural steel work is subjected to sudden loads) the factor of safety is taken as the
ratio of ultimate stress to the working stress, whose value is taken as 4 to 6.

Example 36.1. A mild steel rod of 12 mm diameter was tested for tensile strength, with the

gauge length of 60 mm. Following were the observations :

(a) Final length = 78 mm

(b) Final diameter = 7mm

(c) Yield load = 34 kN

(d) Ultimate load = 61 kN

Calculate (a) yield stress, (b) ultimate tensile stress, (c) percentage reduction, and (d) percent-

age elongation.

SOLUTION.

Given. Original diameter of rod = 12 mm; Original length = 60 mm; Final length = 78 mm; Final

36.12. Barba’s Law and Unwin’s Formula

Prof. Barba, after carrying out a series of experiments on tensile testing of a number of specimens,
found that the percentage elongation gives a measure of ductility of the metal. Moreover, the amount
of local extension depends upon the material and also on the transverse dimensions of the test pieces.
He observed that as the test pieces are made from bars, strips, sheets, wires, forgings, castings etc.,
therefore some standard means of comparison of results are necessary. He enunciated a law which
states, ‘‘In tension, similar test pieces deforms similarly.” He further stated that two test pieces are
said to be similar if they have equal value of :

Gauge length

Cross-sectional area

Prof. Unwin, as a result of the experiments conducted by Barba, gave an expression for total
extension,

where 6! = Total extension of the gauge length,
1 = Gauge length,
A = Original area of specimen cross-section, and
band c = Constants depending upon the quality of the specimen material.

EXAMPLE 36.2. Two specimens A and B of the same material were tested in a laboratory and
the results are shown in the table below :

36.13. Compression Test

It is merely the opposite of the tension test. The compression test is generally performed for
testing the brittle materials such as cast iron, concrete, stone etc. The specimens used in this test are
usually made of cubical or cylindrical shape. It has been observed that some errors are always introduced
in this test due to the following practical difficulties :

1. Since the top and bottom faces of the specimen are seldom absolutely parallel, therefore it is

very difficult to ensure axial loading on the specimen.

Chapter 36 : Mechanical Properties of Materials m 841

2. Since the length of the specimen is kept short enough (not more than twice of its diameter) to
avoid its buckling, therefore within the elastic limit a small compression takes place, which
is difficult to measure accurately.

3. The friction between the ends of the specimen and clutches of the machine, prevents the
dimensions of the specimen ends from increasing. This results in the lateral expansion to
take place more in the centre, instead of uniform increase in diameter throughout the whole
length. Such an effect, which is called barrel effect, is not a case of an ideal compression.

Now we shall discuss the compression test for ductile materials and brittle materials.
1. Compression test for ductile materials (i.e., mild steel, copper etc.)

Consider a ductile material specimen (say a mild steel
bar) of uniform section, subjected to a gradually increasing ptt TTT Tt yA
push. If we plot the stresses along the vertical axis, and PET eT EAL
the corresponding strains along the horizontal axis and :
draw acurve passing through the vicinity of all such points,
we shall obtain a graph as shown in Fig. 36.3.

We see, from the graph, that the curve from O to A is
a straight line, which represents that the stress is
proportional to strain. Up to elastic limit, all the metals
have approximately the same modulus of elasticity in
compression, as that in tension. If the specimen is stressed
beyond the elastic limit, the strain increases more quickly
than the stress (in comparison from O to A). This happens,
because the sudden contraction of the specimen takes
place, without an appreciable increase in the stress. At B,
the specimen regains some strength and, higher values of
stresses are required for higher strains, than those between
A and B. Beyond B, the curve continues, almost without
any limit, as there is no failure of the material on account

of its ductility and the cross-sectional area goes on O ,

. . . . ; Strain —>
increasing continuously, with the increase of load. The

specimen will shorten and bulge out. Fig. 36.3

2. Compression test for brittle materials (i.e., cast iron, concrete, etc.)

If we perform the compression test with a specimen of some brittle material (say a cast iron bar)
and draw a curve with stresses along vertical axis and the corresponding strains along horizontal axis,
we shall obtain a graph as shown is Fig. 36.3. We see, from the graph, that there is a little strain as
compared to stress and there is always a point, where the specimen will fail due to shear along a
diagonal plane.

The compression test is mainly performed for testing brittle materials only.

36.14. Impact Test

Many machines or machine components are subjected to a suddenly applied load, which is called
impact blow. For determining the suitability of a material to resist the impacts, Izod and Charpy tests
are generally carried out. The Izod test is conducted as discussed below.

The standard test piece, for an Izod test, may be square or round as shown in Fig. 36.4 (a)
and (b).

This test enables us to estimate the property of toughness of a material. The toughness of a
material may be defined as the energy absorbed in the failure of its specimen. The energy absorbed by

842 Strength of Materials

a specimen, during its failure, is the
product of its deformation and the
average stress. A little consideration will
show, that a material, which can be highly
stressed and greatly deformed, will be . 28 mm} le->| a
able to with-stand a high blow ; and thus 75 min

may be said to be more tough.

There are many types of Izod testing
machines available in the market. But the
basic principle, on which all of them are
based, is the same.

The scale of an Izod testing machine
has zero in the vertical line and graduated P
on both sides from zero to the maximum
capacity of the machine. A pendulum is
released from the right side from a known Fig. 36.4
angle, which swings on other side of the
scale. A little consideration will show, that if the pendulum is not interrupted anywhere, the angle to
which it will swing up on the left will be equal to the angle from which it was released (neglecting the
bearing friction of the pendulum). But the specimen is kept in the path of the pendulum, which is
broken by the impact of the pendulum. The energy absorbed by the specimen, during the breaking, is
given by the difference between the angle through which the pendulum was released and the angle
through which the pendulum has reached after breaking away the specimen.

36.15. Fatigue Test

Some of the machine parts such as axles, shafts, crankshafts, connecting rods, springs, pinion
teeth are subjected to varying stresses. It includes the variation in the intensity of the same type of
stresses as well as different types of stresses (i.e., change of stress, from tensile to compressive and
vice versa). The varying stresses may be broadly classified into the following four types :

. 28 mm
75 min

(b) Round test piece

1. The stress varying between two limits of equal value, but of opposite sign.

2. The stress varying between two limits of unequal values, but of opposite sign.
3. The stress varying between zero and a definite value.

4. The stress varying between two limits of equal values, but of opposite sign.

Though there are numerous ways of fatigue test in a laboratory, yet the basic principle is the
same. The most common test is a rotating bar test of cantilever type and beam type. In this test, a
number of identical test piece bars (say 8 to 10) are made from a material. One of the piece is fixed to
the machine. A load is gradually applied to the test piece. (This load should not be less than that,
which can produce a stress equal to 3/4 of the tensile strength of the material up to the elastic limit).
The rotation of the electric motor will sometimes push the test piece downwards and sometimes pull
upwards, which will reverse the stresses in the upper and lower fibres of the test piece. The speed of
the motor will indicate the frequency of the stress reversal.

The speed of the motor shaft is kept constant. It has been experimentally found, that after a
sufficient number of stress reversals, a crack in the form of a ring is formed on the outer surface. This
crack goes on extending towards the centre of the test piece, till it breaks away. It has also been
observed that the speed of the motor (or in other words the frequency of the stress reversal) has no
effect on the result. But it is the load or the intensity of the maximum stress, which controls the result.

After the first test piece breaks away, the second piece is tested with a decreased load. The third,

Chapter 36 : Mechanical Properties of Materials m 843

fourth, fifth etc. pieces are then tested with decreased loads. It may be noted that the number of
reversals, each time, goes on increasing with the decrease in load. After some tests, a limit is reached,
when the stress is not sufficient to break the test piece even after 10 x 10° stress reversals (in some
countries, this limit is 20 x 10°). This safe stress, which after reversing for 10 x 10° time does not
cause the test piece to break, is called endurance limit.

All the ferrous metals have endurance limit between 0.4 to 0.6 of the tensile strength up to the
elastic limit.
