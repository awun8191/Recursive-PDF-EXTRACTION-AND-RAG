COPYRIGHT LAW AND ITS IMPLICATION IN NIGERIA

Copyright is a measure to check unauthorized copying and proliferation of creative works
of authors or artists. In layman language, copyright can be said to be the right granted by
law to the original owner of a work. 1.e an author, artist, musician etc.

Copyright is abused by any person, group of people, or organisation who reproduce
original works of others for commercial or personal gains without due permission of the
copyright owner.

Nigerian Copyright Law and its Implication

Copyright in Nigeria is a statutorily granted right. The Constitution of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria (1999) has copyright on its exclusive legislative list. The Nigerian
Act governing copyright is the ‘The Copyright Act, CAP C28, Laws of the Federation of
Nigeria (LFN 2004)’.

This Act gives creators and their assignees exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute and
make most other use of the original works. The Legal body known as ‘Nigerian
Copyright Commission’ is responsible for all matters relating to copyright. Copyright
duration is between the periods of fifty to hundred years depending on the type of work.

Consequence of Breaking Copyright Law

While there are many consequences of breaking copyright laws, the most common
include monetary fines, loss of property, loss of freedom, or loss of employment. In some
countries copyright infringement (the use of copyrighted material without permission or
the right of ownership) could carry the penalty of criminal and civil punishment if the
copyright owner should choose to file a claim and take the guilty party to court.

How to Get a Copyright
i. File application for a copyright on a work with the appropriate agency.

ii. Obtain the appropriate application form for the particular work or intellectual
property to be copyrighted.

iii. Pay the associated fee and submit a copy or copies of the work to the copyright
agency.

Note:

It is important to note that in many countries, all intellectual property is protected under
copyright law from the moment it is created. Filing for copyright protection provides
proof of ownership and the required paperwork needed in the event that someone tries to
steal an intellectual or creative work. Given the relatively small amount of work needed
to apply for a copyright, if one is genuinely concerned that someone might copy his
work, it might be a good idea to get a copyright.
