Preface

he pervasive presence of electronic devices and instrumentation in all aspects of engineering design and

analysis is one of the manifestations of the electronic revolution that has characterized the second half of the

20th century. Every aspect of engineering practice, and even of everyday life, has been affected in some way

or another by electrical and electronic devices and instruments. Computers are perhaps the most obvious
manifestations of this presence. However, many other areas of electrical engineering are also important to the
practicing engineer, from mechanical and industrial engineering, to chemical, nuclear, and materials engineering,
to the aerospace and astronautical disciplines, to civil and the emerging field of biomedical engineering. Engineers
today must be able to communicate effectively within the interdisciplinary teams in which they work.

OBJECTIVES

Engineering education and engineering professional practice have seen some rather profound changes in the past
decade. The integration of electronics and computer technologies in all engineering academic disciplines and
the emergence of digital electronics and microcomputers as a central element of many engineering products and
processes have become a common theme since the conception of this book.

The principal objective of the book is to present the principles of electrical, electronic, and electromechanical
engineering to an audience composed of non-electrical engineering majors, and ranging from sophomore students
in their first required introductory electrical engineering course, to seniors, to first-year graduate students enrolled
in more specialized courses in electronics, electromechanics, and mechatronics.

A second objective is to present these principles by focusing on the important results and applications and
presenting the students with the most appropriate analytical and computational tools to solve a variety of practical
problems.

Finally, a third objective of the book is to illustrate, by way of concrete, fully worked examples, a number of
relevant applications of electrical engineering principles. These examples are drawn from the author’s industrial
research experience and from ideas contributed by practicing engineers and industrial partners.

ORGANIZATION AND CONTENT

The book is divided into three parts, devoted to circuits, electronics, and electromechanics.

Part I: Circuits

The first part of this book presents a basic introduction to circuit analysis (Chapters 2 through 7). The material
includes over 440 homework problems.

Part: Il Electronics

Part II, on electronics (Chapters 8 through 12), contains a chapter on operational amplifiers, one on diodes, two
chapters on transistors—one each on BJTs and FETs, and one on digital logic circuits. The material contained in
this section is focused on basic applications of these concepts. The chapters include 320 homework problems.

Part Ill: Electromechanics

Part III, on electromechanics (Chapters 13 and 14), includes basic material on electromechanical transducers and
the basic operation of DC and AC machines. The two chapters include 126 homework problems.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This edition of the book requires a special acknowledgment for the effort put forth by my friend Tom Hartley of the
University of Akron, who has become a mentor, coach, and inspiration for me throughout this project. Professor
Hartley, who is an extraordinary teacher and a devoted user of this book, has been closely involved in the development
of this edition by suggesting topics for new examples and exercises, creating new homework problems, providing
advice and coaching through all of the revisions, and sometimes just by lifting my spirits. I look forward to many
more years of such collaborations.

Book prefaces have a way of marking the passage of time. When the first edition of Principles and Applications
of Electrical Engineering was published, the birth of our first child, Alex, was nearing. Each of the following two
editions was similarly accompanied by the births of Maria and Michael. Now that we have successfully reached
the fifth edition of Principles and Applications and the new first edition of this book (but only the third child) Iam
observing that Alex is beginning to understand some of the principles exposed in this book through his passion for
the FIRST Lego League and the Lego Mindstorms robots. Through the years, our family continues to be the center
of my life, and I am grateful to Kathryn, Alessandro, Maria, and Michael for all their love.

The analysis of an electric network consists of determining each of the unknown
branch currents and node voltages. It is therefore important to define all the rele-
vant variables as clearly as possible, and in systematic fashion. Once the known and
unknown variables have been identified, a set of equations relating these variables
is constructed, and these equations are solved by means of suitable techniques. The
analysis of electric circuits consists of writing the smallest set of equations sufficient
to solve for all the unknown variables. The procedures required to write these equa-
tions are the subject of Chapter 3 and are very well documented and codified in the
form of simple rules. The analysis of electric circuits is greatly simplified if some
standard conventions are followed.

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERING

he aim of this chapter is to introduce electrical engineering. The chapter is

organized to provide the newcomer with a view of the different specialties

making up electrical engineering and to place the intent and organization of

the book into perspective. Perhaps the first question that surfaces in the mind
of the student approaching the subject is, Why electrical engineering? Since this book
is directed at a readership having a mix of engineering backgrounds (including elec-
trical engineering), the question is well justified and deserves some discussion. The
chapter begins by defining the various branches of electrical engineering, showing
some of the interactions among them, and illustrating by means of a practical example
how electrical engineering is intimately connected to many other engineering disci-
plines. Section 1.2 introduces the Engineer-in-Training (EIT) national examination.
In Section 1.3 the fundamental physical quantities and the system of units are defined,
to set the stage for the chapters that follow. Finally, in Section 1.4 the organization of
the book is discussed, to give the student, as well as the teacher, a sense of continuity
in the development of the different subjects covered in Chapters 2 through 14.

Chapter 1 Introduction to Electrical Engineering 3

EXAMPLE 1.1 Electrical Systems in a Passenger Automobile

A familiar example illustrates how the seemingly disparate specialties of electrical engineering
actually interact to permit the operation of a very familiar engineering system: the automobile.
Figure 1.2 presents a view of electrical engineering systems in a modern automobile. Even in
older vehicles, the electrical system—in effect, an electric circuit—plays a very important part
in the overall operation. (Chapters 2 and 3 describe the basics of electric circuits.) An inductor
coil generates a sufficiently high voltage to allow a spark to form across the spark plug gap
and to ignite the air-fuel mixture; the coil is supplied by a DC voltage provided by a lead-acid
battery. (Ignition circuits are studied in some detail in Chapter 5.) In addition to providing the
energy for the ignition circuits, the battery supplies power to many other electrical components,
the most obvious of which are the lights, the windshield wipers, and the radio. Electric power
(Chapter 7) is carried from the battery to all these components by means of a wire harness,
which constitutes a rather elaborate electric circuit (see Figure 2.12 for a closer look). In recent
years, the conventional electric ignition system has been supplanted by electronic ignition;
that is, solid-state electronic devices called transistors have replaced the traditional breaker
points. The advantage of transistorized ignition systems over the conventional mechanical ones
is their greater reliability, ease of control, and life span (mechanical breaker points are subject
to wear). You will study transistors and other electronic devices in Chapters 8, 9, and 10.

Other electrical engineering disciplines are fairly obvious in the automobile. The on-board
radio receives electromagnetic waves by means of the antenna, and decodes the communication
signals to reproduce sounds and speech of remote origin; other common communication
systems that exploit electromagnetics are CB radios and the ever more common cellular
phones. But this is not all! The battery is, in effect, a self-contained 12-VDC electric power
system, providing the energy for all the aforementioned functions. In order for the battery to
have a useful lifetime, a charging system, composed of an alternator and of power electronic
devices, is present in every automobile. Electric power systems are covered in Chapter 7
and power electronic devices in Chapter 10. The alternator is an electric machine, as are the
motors that drive the power mirrors, power windows, power seats, and other convenience
features found in luxury cars. Incidentally, the loudspeakers are also electric machines! All
these devices are described in Chapters 13 and 14.

The list does not end here, though. In fact, some of the more interesting applications
of electrical engineering to the automobile have not been discussed yet. Consider computer
systems. Digital circuits are covered in Chapter 12. You are certainly aware that in the last two

Chapter 1 Introduction to Electrical Engineering

decades, environmental concerns related to exhaust emissions from automobiles have led to
the introduction of sophisticated engine emission control systems. The heart of such control
systems is a type of computer called a microprocessor. The microprocessor receives signals
from devices (called sensors) that measure relevant variables—such as the engine speed, the
concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gases, the position of the throttle valve (i.e., the driver’s
demand for engine power), and the amount of air aspirated by the engine—and subsequently
computes the optimal amount of fuel and the correct timing of the spark to result in the cleanest
combustion possible under the circumstances. As the presence of computers on board becomes
more pervasive—in areas such as antilock braking, electronically controlled suspensions, four-
wheel steering systems, and electronic cruise control—communications among the various
on-board computers will have to occur at faster and faster rates. Someday in the not-so-distant
future, these communications may occur over a fiber-optic network, and electro-optics will
replace the conventional wire harness. Note that electro-optics is already present in some of
the more advanced displays that are part of an automotive instrumentation system.

Finally, today’s vehicles also benefit from the significant advances made in communi-
cation systems. Vehicle navigation systems can include Global Positioning System, or GPS,
technology, as well as a variety of communications and networking technologies, such as wire-
less interfaces (e.g., based on the “Bluetooth” standard) and satellite radio and driver assistance
systems, such as the GM “OnStar” system.

1.2 FUNDAMENTALS OF ENGINEERING
EXAM REVIEW

To become a professional engineer it is necessary to satisfy four requirements. The
first is the completion of a B.S. degree in engineering from an accredited college
or university (although it is theoretically possible to be registered without having
completed a degree). The second is the successful completion of the Fundamentals
of Engineering (FE) Examination. This is an eight-hour exam that covers general
undergraduate engineering education. The third requirement is two to four years of
engineering experience after passing the FE exam. Finally, the fourth requirement is
successful completion of the Principles and Practice of Engineering or Professional
Engineer (PE) Examination.

The FE exam is a two-part national examination, administered by the National
Council of Examiners for Engineers and Surveyors (NCEES) and given twice
a year (in April and October). The exam is divided into two four-hour sessions,
consisting of 120 questions in the four-hour morning session, and 60 questions in
the four-hour afternoon session. The morning session covers general background in
12 different areas, one of which is Electricity and Magnetism. The afternoon session
requires the examinee to choose among seven modules—Chemical, Civil, Electrical,
Environmental, Industrial, Mechanical, and Other/General engineering.

One of the aims of this book is to assist you in preparing for the Electricity
and Magnetism patt of the morning session. This part of the examination consists of
approximately 9 percent of the morning session, and covers the following topics:

A. Charge, energy, current, voltage, power.

B. Work done in moving a charge in an electric field (relationship between
voltage and work).

C. Force between charges.
Current and voltage laws (Kirchhoff, Ohm).

E. Equivalent circuits (series, parallel).

Appendix C (available online) contains review of the electrical circuits portion of the

Appendix C also contains a collection of sample problems—some including a full
explanation of the solution, some with answers supplied separately. This material has
been derived from the author’s experience in co-teaching the FE exam preparation
course offered to Ohio State University seniors.

1.3 SYSTEM OF UNITS

This book employs the International System of Units (also called SI, from the French
Systéme /nternational des Unités). SI units are commonly adhered to by virtually all
engineering professional societies. This section summarizes SI units and will serve
as a useful reference in reading the book.

SI units are based on six fundamental quantities, listed in Table 1.2. All other
units may be derived in terms of the fundamental units of Table 1.2. Since, in practice,
one often needs to describe quantities that occur in large multiples or small fractions
of a unit, standard prefixes are used to denote powers of 10 of SI (and derived) units.
These prefixes are listed in Table 1.3. Note that, in general, engineering units are
expressed in powers of 10 that are multiples of 3.

For example, 10~* s would be referred to as 100 x 10~° s, or 100 Ls (or, less
frequently, 0.1 ms).

This book includes a number of special features designed to make learning easier
and to allow students to explore the subject matter of the book in greater depth, if
so desired, through the use of computer-aided tools and the Internet. The principal
features of the book are described on the next two pages.

Chapter 1 Introduction to Electrical Engineering

1. The principal learning objectives are clearly identified at the beginning of each
chapter.

2. The symbol D is used to identify definitions and derivations critical to the accom-
plishment of a specific learning objective.

3. Each example is similarly marked.

EXAMPLES

The examples in the book have also been set aside from the main text, so that they can be
easily identified. All examples are solved by following the same basic methodology: A clear
and simple problem statement is given, followed by a solution. The solution consists of several
parts: All known quantities in the problem are summarized, and the problem statement is
translated into a specific objective (e.g., “Find the equivalent resistance R”).

Next, the given data and assumptions are listed, and finally the analysis is presented. The
analysis method is based on the following principle: All problems are solved symbolically first,
to obtain more general solutions that may guide the student in solving homework problems;
the numerical solution is provided at the very end of the analysis. Each problem closes with
comments summarizing the findings and tying the example to other sections of the book.

The solution methodology used in this book can be used as a general guide to problem-

FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRIC
CIRCUITS

hapter 2 presents the fundamental laws that govern the behavior of electric

circuits, and it serves as the foundation to the remainder of this book. The chap-

ter begins with a series of definitions to acquaint the reader with electric circuits;

next, the two fundamental laws of circuit analysis are introduced: Kirchhoff’ s
current and voltage laws. With the aid of these tools, the concepts of electric power
and the sign convention and methods for describing circuit elements—resistors in
particular—are presented. Following these preliminary topics, the emphasis moves
to basic analysis techniques—voltage and current dividers, and to some applica-
tion examples related to the engineering use of these concepts. Examples include a
description of strain gauges, circuits for the measurements of force and other related
mechanical variables, and of the study of an automotive throttle position sensor. The
chapter closes with a brief discussion of electric measuring instruments. The following
box outlines the principal learning objectives of the chapter.

The role played by a voltage

the force of gravity. Raising
amass with respect to a

its potential energy. This
potential energy can be
converted to kinetic energy
when the object moves to a
lower position relative to the
reference surface. The

voltage, or potential

difference across a voltage
source plays an analogous
role, raising the electrical
potential of the circuit, so that
current can flow, converting
the potential energy within
the voltage source to electric

power.

and voltage and current sources. Section 2.1.

2. Apply Kirchhoff’s laws to simple electric circuits and derive the basic circuit
equations. Sections 2.2 and 2.3.

elements. Calculate the power dissipated by a resistor. Section 2.4.

4. Apply the voltage and current divider laws to calculate unknown variables in simple
series, parallel, and series-parallel circuits. Sections 2.5 and 2.6.

5. Understand the rules for connecting electric measuring instruments to electric
circuits for the measurement of voltage, current, and power. Sections 2.7 and 2.8.

2.1 DEFINITIONS

In this section, we formally define some variables and concepts that are used in the
remainder of the chapter. First, we define voltage and current sources; next, we define
the concepts of branch, node, loop, and mesh, which form the basis of circuit analysis.

Intuitively, an ideal source is a source that can provide an arbitrary amount of
energy. Ideal sources are divided into two types: voltage sources and current sources.
Of these, you are probably more familiar with the first, since dry-cell, alkaline, and
lead-acid batteries are all voltage sources (they are not ideal, of course). You might
have to think harder to come up with a physical example that approximates the
behavior of an ideal current source; however, reasonably good approximations of
ideal current sources also exist. For instance, a voltage source connected in series
with a circuit element that has a large resistance to the flow of current from the source
provides a nearly constant—though small—current and therefore acts very nearly as
an ideal current source. A battery charger is another example of a device that can
operate as a current source.

Ideal Voltage Sources

An ideal voltage source is an electric device that generates a prescribed voltage at
its terminals. The ability of an ideal voltage source to generate its output voltage is
not affected by the current it must supply to the other circuit elements. Another way
to phrase the same idea is as follows:

An ideal voltage source provides a prescribed voltage across its terminals
irrespective of the current flowing through it. The amount of current supplied
by the source is determined by the circuit connected to it.

Figure 2.1 depicts various symbols for voltage sources that are employed
throughout this book. Note that the output voltage of an ideal source can be a function
of time. In general, the following notation is employed in this book, unless otherwise
noted. A generic voltage source is denoted by a lowercase uv. If it is necessary to
emphasize that the source produces a time-varying voltage, then the notation u(f) is

employed. Finally, a constant, or direct current, or DC, voltage source is denoted by
the uppercase character V. Note that by convention the direction of positive current
flow out of a voltage source is out of the positive terminal.

The notion of an ideal voltage source is best appreciated within the context of the
source-load representation of electric circuits. Figure 2.2 depicts the connection of an
energy source with a passive circuit (i.e., a circuit that can absorb and dissipate energy).
Three different representations are shown to illustrate the conceptual, symbolic, and
physical significance of this source-load idea.

In the analysis of electric circuits, we choose to represent the physical reality
of Figure 2.2(c) by means of the approximation provided by ideal circuit elements,
as depicted in Figure 2.2(b).

Ideal Current Sources

An ideal current source is a device that can generate a prescribed current independent
of the circuit to which it is connected. To do so, it must be able to generate an arbitrary
voltage across its terminals. Figure 2.3 depicts the symbol used to represent ideal
current sources. By analogy with the definition of the ideal voltage source just stated,
we write that

An ideal current source provides a prescribed current to any circuit connected
to it. The voltage generated by the source is determined by the circuit connected
to it.

The role played by a current
source in an electric circuit is
very similar to that of a pump
in a hydraulic circuit. In a
pump, an internal mechanism
(pistons, vanes, or impellers)
forces fluid to be pumped
from a reservoir to a hydraulic
circuit. The volume flow rate
of the fluid q, in cubic meters
per second, in the hydraulic
circuit, is analogous to the
electrical current in the circuit.

Chapter 2 Fundamentals of Electric Circuits

The same uppercase and lowercase convention used for voltage sources is employed
in denoting current sources.

Dependent (Controlled) Sources

The sources described so far have the capability of generating a prescribed voltage
or current independent of any other element within the circuit. Thus, they are termed
independent sources. There exists another category of sources, however, whose output
(current or voltage) is a function of some other voltage or current in a circuit. These
are called dependent (or controlled) sources. A different symbol, in the shape of
a diamond, is used to represent dependent sources and to distinguish them from
independent sources. The symbols typically used to represent dependent sources are
depicted in Figure 2.4; the table illustrates the relationship between the source voltage
or current and the voltage or current it depends on—+», or iy, respectively—which can
be any voltage or current in the circuit.

Figure 2.4 Symbols for dependent sources

Dependent sources are very useful in describing certain types of electronic
circuits. You will encounter dependent sources again in Chapters 8, 10, and 11, when
electronic amplifiers are discussed.

An electrical network is a collection of elements through which current flows.
The following definitions introduce some important elements of a network.

Branch

A branch is any portion of a circuit with two terminals connected to it. A branch may
consist of one or more circuit elements (Figure 2.5). In practice, any circuit element
with two terminals connected to it is a branch.

Node

A node is the junction of two or more branches (one often refers to the junction of
only two branches as a trivial node). Figure 2.6 illustrates the concept. In effect,
any connection that can be accomplished by soldering various terminals together is
a node. It is very important to identify nodes properly in the analysis of electrical
networks.

It is sometimes convenient to use the concept of a supernode. A supernode
is obtained by defining a region that encloses more than one node, as shown in the
rightmost circuit of Figure 2.6. Supernodes can be treated in exactly the same way as
nodes.

A mesh is a loop that does not contain other loops. Meshes are an important aid to
certain analysis methods. In Figure 2.7, the circuit with loops 1, 2, and 3 consists of two
meshes: Loops | and 2 are meshes, but loop 3 is not a mesh, because it encircles both
loops | and 2. The one-loop circuit of Figure 2.7 is also a one-mesh circuit. Figure 2.8
illustrates how meshes are simpler to visualize in complex networks than loops are.

Network Analysis

The analysis of an electrical network consists of determining each of the unknown
branch currents and node voltages. It is therefore important to define all the rele-
vant variables as clearly as possible and in systematic fashion. Once the known and
unknown variables have been identified, a set of equations relating these variables is
constructed, and these are solved by means of suitable techniques.

Before introducing methods for the analysis of electrical networks, we must
formally present some important laws of circuit analysis.

2.2 CHARGE, CURRENT, AND KIRCHHOFF’S
CURRENT LAW

The earliest accounts of electricity date from about 2,500 years ago, when it was
discovered that static charge on a piece of amber was capable of attracting very light
objects, such as feathers. The word electricity originated about 600 B.c.; it comes from
elektron, which was the ancient Greek word for amber. The true nature of electricity
was not understood until much later, however. Following the work of Alessandro Volta
and his invention of the copper-zinc battery, it was determined that static electricity
and the current that flows in metal wires connected to a battery are due to the same
fundamental mechanism: the atomic structure of matter, consisting of a nucleus—
neutrons and protons—surrounded by electrons. The fundamental electric quantity
is charge, and the smallest amount of charge that exists is the charge carried by an
electron, equal to

de = —1.602 x 107° C (2.1)

As you can see, the amount of charge associated with an electron is rather small.
This, of course, has to do with the size of the unit we use to measure charge, the
coulomb (C), named after Charles Coulomb. However, the definition of the coulomb
leads to an appropriate unit when we define electric current, since current consists of
the flow of very large numbers of charge particles. The other charge-carrying particle
in an atom, the proton, is assigned a plus sign and the same magnitude. The charge
of a proton is

dp = +1.602 x 107! C (2.2)

Electrons and protons are often referred to as elementary charges.
Electric current is defined as the time rate of change of charge passing through
a predetermined area. Typically, this area is the cross-sectional area of a metal

Part I Circuits 15

wire; however, we explore later a number of cases in which the current-carrying
material is not a conducting wire. Figure 2.9 depicts a macroscopic view of the
flow of charge in a wire, where we imagine Aq units of charge flowing through
the cross-sectional area A in A? units of time. The resulting current i is then

given by
Current i = dq/dt is generated by
the flow of charge through the

If we consider the effect of the enormous number of elementary charges actually a) eee
flowing, we can write this relationship in differential form:

d C
i= “4 _ (2.4) Figure 2.9 Current flow in
dt S an electric conductor

The units of current are called amperes, where | ampere (A) = 1 coulomb/second
(C/s). The name of the unit is a tribute to the French scientist André-Marie Ampére.
The electrical engineering convention states that the positive direction of current flow
is that of positive charges. In metallic conductors, however, current is carried by neg-
ative charges; these charges are the free electrons in the conduction band, which are
only weakly attracted to the atomic structure in metallic elements and are therefore
easily displaced in the presence of electric fields.

per unit length of the conductor:

Current = carrier charge density per unit length x carrier velocity

I= (¢ “) x (u =) = (-s0.33 x 103 ) (19.9 x 10-8 =) —-1A

Comments: Charge carrier density is a function of material properties. Carrier velocity is a
function of the applied electric field.

In order for current to flow, there must exist a closed circuit.

Figure 2.10 depicts a simple circuit, composed of a battery (e.g., a dry-cell or
alkaline 1.5-V battery) and a lightbulb.

Note that in the circuit of Figure 2.10, the current i flowing from the battery to
the lightbulb is equal to the current flowing from the lightbulb to the battery. In other
words, no current (and therefore no charge) is “lost” around the closed circuit. This
principle was observed by the German scientist G. R. Kirchhoff! and is now known as
Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL). Kirchhoff’s current law states that because charge
cannot be created but must be conserved, the sum of the currents at a node must equal
zero. Formally,

N
> i, =0 Kirchhoff’s current law (2.5)

n=1

The significance of Kirchhoff’s current law is illustrated in Figure 2.11, where the
simple circuit of Figure 2.10 has been augmented by the addition of two lightbulbs
(note how the two nodes that exist in this circuit have been emphasized by the shaded
areas). In this illustration, we define currents entering a node as being negative and

'Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824-1887), a German scientist, published the first systematic description of
the laws of circuit analysis. His contribution—though not original in terms of its scientific
content—forms the basis of all circuit analysis.

currents exiting the node as being positive. Thus, the resulting expression for node |
of the circuit of Figure 2.11 is

-—i+i+b4+2R=0

Note that if we had assumed that currents entering the node were positive, the result
would not have changed.

Kirchhoff’s current law is one of the fundamental laws of circuit analysis,
making it possible to express currents in a circuit in terms of one another. KCL is
explored further in Examples 2.2 through 2.4.

Problem

Determine the unknown currents in the circuit of Figure 2.13.

Solution
Known Quantities:

Is =5A =2A h=-3A h=15A
Find: I and J4.

Analysis: Two nodes are clearly shown in Figure 2.13 as node aand node b; the third node in the
circuit is the reference (ground) node. In this example we apply KCL at each of the three nodes.

At node a:
h+th+h=0
Ih +2-—3=0

Ih=1A

Note that the three currents are all defined as flowing away from the node, but one of the
currents has a negative value (i.e., it is actually flowing toward the node).

At node b:
I; —-h -l=0
5-15-lL=0

Iy=3.5A

Note that the current from the battery is defined in a direction opposite to that of the other two
currents (i.e., toward the node instead of away from the node). Thus, in applying KCL, we
have used opposite signs for the first and the latter two currents.

At the reference node: If we use the same convention (positive value for currents entering
the node and negative value for currents exiting the node), we obtain the following equations:

—5+15+h=0
I, =3.5A

Part I Circuits 19

Comments: The result obtained at the reference node is exactly the same as we already
calculated at node b. This fact suggests that some redundancy may result when we apply KCL
at each node in a circuit. In Chapter 3 we develop a method called node analysis that ensures
the derivation of the smallest possible set of independent equations.

2.3 VOLTAGE AND KIRCHHOFF’S VOLTAGE
LAW

Charge moving in an electric circuit gives rise to a current, as stated in Section 2.2.
Naturally, it must take some work, or energy, for the charge to move between two
points in a circuit, say, from point a to point b. The total work per unit charge
associated with the motion of charge between two points is called voltage. Thus,
the units of voltage are those of energy per unit charge; they have been called volts
in honor of Alessandro Volta:

joule (J)
1 volt (V) = 1 —————— 2.6
volt (V) coulomb (C) (2.6)

The voltage, or potential difference, between two points in a circuit indicates the
energy required to move charge from one point to the other. The role played by a
voltage source in an electric circuit is equivalent to that played by the force of gravity.
Raising a mass with respect to a reference surface increases its potential energy. This
potential energy can be converted to kinetic energy when the object moves to a lower
position relative to the reference surface. The voltage, or potential difference, across a
voltage source plays an analogous role, raising the electrical potential of the circuit, so
that charge can move in the circuit, converting the potential energy within the voltage
source to electric power. As will be presently shown, the direction, or polarity, of
the voltage is closely tied to whether energy is being dissipated or generated in the
process. The seemingly abstract concept of work being done in moving charges can
be directly applied to the analysis of electric circuits; consider again the simple circuit
consisting of a battery and a lightbulb. The circuit is drawn again for convenience in
Figure 2.15, with nodes defined by the letters a and b. Experimental observations led
Kirchhoff to the formulation of the second of his laws, Kirchhoff’s voltage law, or
KVL. The principle underlying KVL is that no energy is lost or created in an electric
circuit; in circuit terms, the sum of all voltages associated with sources must equal
the sum of the load voltages, so that the net voltage around a closed circuit is zero.
If this were not the case, we would need to find a physical explanation for the excess
(or missing) energy not accounted for in the voltages around a circuit. Kirchhoff’s
voltage law may be stated in a form similar to that used for KCL

N
Som =0 — Kirchhoff’s voltage law (2.7)

n=1

where the v,, are the individual voltages around the closed circuit. To understand this
concept, we must introduce the concept of reference voltage.

In Figure 2.15, the voltage across the lightbulb is the difference between two
node voltages, vg and v,. In a circuit, any one node may be chosen as the refer-
ence node, such that all node voltages may be referenced to this reference voltage.
In Figure 2.15, we could select the voltage at node b as the reference voltage and
observe that the battery’s positive terminal is 1.5 V above the reference voltage. It is
convenient to assign a value of zero to reference voltages, since this simplifies the
voltage assignments around the circuit. With reference to Figure 2.15, and assuming

Part I Circuits

that v, = 0, we can write
vp =15V
V2 = Vabh = Va — Up = Va — O = Vg

but v, and v; are the same voltage, that is, the voltage at node a (referenced to
node b). Thus

vi = U2

One may think of the work done in moving a charge from point a to point b and
the work done moving it back from b to a as corresponding directly to the voltages
across individual circuit elements. Let Q be the total charge that moves around the
circuit per unit time, giving rise to current i. Then the work W done in moving Q
from b to a (i.e., across the battery) is

Wig =OX15V (2.8)

Similarly, work is done in moving Q from a to J, that is, across the lightbulb. Note
that the word potential is quite appropriate as a synonym of voltage, in that voltage
represents the potential energy between two points in a circuit: If we remove the
lightbulb from its connections to the battery, there still exists a voltage across the (now
disconnected) terminals b and a. This is illustrated in Figure 2.16.

A moment’s reflection upon the significance of voltage should suggest that it
must be necessary to specify a sign for this quantity. Consider, again, the same dry-
cell or alkaline battery where, by virtue of an electrochemically induced separation
of charge, a 1.5-V potential difference is generated. The potential generated by the
battery may be used to move charge in a circuit. The rate at which charge is moved
once a closed circuit is established (i.e., the current drawn by the circuit connected to
the battery) depends now on the circuit element we choose to connect to the battery.
Thus, while the voltage across the battery represents the potential for providing energy
to a circuit, the voltage across the lightbulb indicates the amount of work done in
dissipating energy. In the first case, energy is generated; in the second, it is consumed
(note that energy may also be stored, by suitable circuit elements yet to be introduced).
This fundamental distinction requires attention in defining the sign (or polarity) of
voltages.

We shall, in general, refer to elements that provide energy as sources and to
elements that dissipate energy as loads. Standard symbols for a generalized source-
and-load circuit are shown in Figure 2.17. Formal definitions are given later.

Ground

The concept of reference voltage finds a practical use in the ground voltage of a circuit.
Ground represents a specific reference voltage that is usually a clearly identified point
in acircuit. For example, the ground reference voltage can be identified with the case
or enclosure of an instrument, or with the earth itself. In residential electric circuits,
the ground reference is a large conductor that is physically connected to the earth. It
is convenient to assign a potential of 0 V to the ground voltage reference.

The choice of the word ground is not arbitrary. This point can be illustrated
by a simple analogy with the physics of fluid motion. Consider a tank of water, as
shown in Figure 2.18, located at a certain height above the ground. The potential
energy due to gravity will cause water to flow out of the pipe at a certain flow
rate. The pressure that forces water out of the pipe is directly related to the head

21

The presence of a voltage, v2,
across the open terminals a and b
indicates the potential energy that
can enable the motion of charge,
once a closed circuit is established
to allow current to flow.

h, — hz in such a way that this pressure is zero when hy = h,. Now the point hs,
corresponding to the ground level, is defined as having zero potential energy. It should
be apparent that the pressure acting on the fluid in the pipe is really caused by the
difference in potential energy (1; — h3) — (hz — hz). It can be seen, then, that it is
not necessary to assign a precise energy level to the height /3; in fact, it would be
extremely cumbersome to do so, since the equations describing the flow of water
would then be different, say, in Denver, Colorado (43 = 1,600 m above sea level),
from those that would apply in Miami, Florida (hz = 0 m above sea level). You see,
then, that it is the relative difference in potential energy that matters in the water tank

2.4 ELECTRIC POWER AND SIGN CONVENTION

The definition of voltage as work per unit charge lends itself very conveniently to
the introduction of power. Recall that power is defined as the work done per unit
time. Thus, the power P either generated or dissipated by a circuit element can be
represented by the following relationship:

work _ work charge

Power = = voltage x current (2.9)

time charge _ time

Thus,

Part I Circuits

The electric power generated by an active element, or that dissipated or stored
by a passive element, is equal to the product of the voltage across the element
and the current flowing through it.

(2.10)

It is easy to verify that the units of voltage Goules per coulomb) times current
(coulombs per second) are indeed those of power (joules per second, or watts).

It is important to realize that, just like voltage, power is a signed quantity,
and it is necessary to make a distinction between positive and negative power. This
distinction can be understood with reference to Figure 2.22, in which two circuits are
shown side by side. The polarity of the voltage across circuit A and the direction of
the current through it indicate that the circuit is doing work in moving charge from
a lower potential to a higher potential. On the other hand, circuit B is dissipating
energy, because the direction of the current indicates that charge is being displaced
from a higher potential to a lower potential. To avoid confusion with regard to the
sign of power, the electrical engineering community uniformly adopts the passive
sign convention, which simply states that the power dissipated by a load is a positive
quantity (or, conversely, that the power generated by a source is a positive quantity).
Another way of phrasing the same concept is to state that if current flows from a
higher to a lower voltage (plus to minus), the power is dissipated and will be a
positive quantity.

It is important to note also that the actual numerical values of voltages and
currents do not matter: Once the proper reference directions have been established
and the passive sign convention has been applied consistently, the answer will be
correct regardless of the reference direction chosen. Examples 2.8 and 2.9 illustrate
this point.

FOCUS ONMETHODOLOGY
THE PASSIVE SIGN CONVENTION

1. Choose an arbitrary direction of current flow.
2. Label polarities of all active elements (voltage and current sources).

3. Assign polarities to all passive elements (resistors and other loads); for
passive elements, current always flows into the positive terminal.

4. Compute the power dissipated by each element according to the following
tule: If positive current flows into the positive terminal of an element, then
the power dissipated is positive (i.e., the element absorbs power); if the
current leaves the positive terminal of an element, then the power
dissipated is negative (i.e., the element delivers power).

EXAMPLE 2.8 Use of the Passive Sign Convention

Problem

Apply the passive sign convention to the circuit of Figure 2.23.

Solution
Known Quantities: Voltages across each circuit element; current in circuit.
Find: Power dissipated or generated by each element.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: Figure 2.24(a) and (b). The voltage drop
across load | is 8 V, that across load 2 is 4 V; the current in the circuit is 0.1 A.

Assumptions: None.

Analysis: Note that the sign convention is independent of the current direction we choose.
We now apply the method twice to the same circuit. Following the passive sign convention,
we first select an arbitrary direction for the current in the circuit; the example will be re-
peated for both possible directions of current flow to demonstrate that the methodology is
sound.

1. Assume clockwise direction of current flow, as shown in Figure 2.24(a).

2. Label polarity of voltage source, as shown in Figure 2.24(a); since the arbitrarily chosen
direction of the current is consistent with the true polarity of the voltage source, the source
voltage will be a positive quantity.

3. Assign polarity to each passive element, as shown in Figure 2.24(a).
4. Compute the power dissipated by each element: Since current flows from — to + through
the battery, the power dissipated by this element will be a negative quantity:
Pp =—vg Xi=—-12Vx01A=-1.2W

that is, the battery generates 1.2 watts (W). The power dissipated by the two loads will
be a positive quantity in both cases, since current flows from plus to minus:

Pi =v xi=8Vx0I01A=0.8 W
Py =wxi=4Vx01A=04W

Next, we repeat the analysis, assuming counterclockwise current direction.

1. Assume counterclockwise direction of current flow, as shown in Figure 2.24(b).

2. Label polarity of voltage source, as shown in Figure 2.24(b); since the arbitrarily chosen
direction of the current is not consistent with the true polarity of the voltage source, the
source voltage will be a negative quantity.

3. Assign polarity to each passive element, as shown in Figure 2.24(b).

4. Compute the power dissipated by each element: Since current flows from plus to minus
through the battery, the power dissipated by this element will be a positive quantity;
however, the source voltage is a negative quantity:

Pz = vp Xi = (—-12 V)(0.1 A) = -1.2W

that is, the battery generates 1.2 W, as in the previous case. The power dissipated by the

Part I Circuits 27

two loads will be a positive quantity in both cases, since current flows from plus to minus:
P»=vu xi=8Vx01A=0.8W
Pyp=wxi=4Vx01A=04W

Comments: It should be apparent that the most important step in the example is the correct
assignment of source voltage; passive elements will always result in positive power dissipation.
Note also that energy is conserved, as the sum of the power dissipated by source and loads is
zero. In other words: Power supplied always equals power dissipated.

EXAMPLE 2.9 Cos

Problem

For the circuit shown in Figure 2.25, determine which components are absorbing power and
which are delivering power. Is conservation of power satisfied? Explain your answer.

Solution
Known Quantities: Current through elements D and E; voltage across elements B, C, E.

Find: Which components are absorbing power, which are supplying power; verify the con-
servation of power.

Figure 2.25

Analysis: By KCL, the current through element B is 5 A, to the right. By KVL,
—vg-3+10+5=0

Therefore, the voltage across element A is
Vg = 12V (positive at the top)

A supplies (12 V)(5 A) = 60 W

B supplies (3 V)(5 A) = 15 W

C absorbs (5 V)(5 A) = 25 W

D absorbs (10 V)(3 A) = 30 W

E absorbs (10 V)(2 A) = 20 W

Total power supplied = 60 W + 15 W=75 W

Total power absorbed = 25 W + 30 W + 20 W = 75 W

Total power supplied = Total power absorbed, so conservation of power is satisfied

Comments: The procedure described in this example can be easily conducted experimentally,
by performing simple voltage and current measurements. Measuring devices are introduced in
Section 2.8.

2.5 CIRCUIT ELEMENTS AND THEIR /-v
CHARACTERISTICS

The relationship between current and voltage at the terminals of a circuit element
defines the behavior of that element within the circuit. In this section we introduce a
graphical means of representing the terminal characteristics of circuit elements. Figure
2.26 depicts the representation that is employed throughout the chapter to denote a
generalized circuit element: The variable i represents the current flowing through the
element, while v is the potential difference, or voltage, across the element.

Suppose now that a known voltage were imposed across a circuit element. The
current that would flow, as a consequence of this voltage, and the voltage itself form a
unique pair of values. If the voltage applied to the element were varied and the resulting
current measured, it would be possible to construct a functional relationship between
voltage and current known as the i-v characteristic (or volt-ampere characteristic).
Such a relationship defines the circuit element, in the sense that if we impose any
prescribed voltage (or current), the resulting current (or voltage) is directly obtainable
from the i-v characteristic. A direct consequence is that the power dissipated (or
generated) by the element may also be determined from the i-v curve.

Figure 2.27 depicts an experiment for empirically determining the i-v charac-
teristic of a tungsten filament lightbulb. A variable voltage source is used to apply
various voltages, and the current flowing through the element is measured for each
applied voltage.

We could certainly express the i-v characteristic of a circuit element in func-
tional form:

i=f(v)  v=g(i) (2.11)

In some circumstances, however, the graphical representation is more desirable,
especially if there is no simple functional form relating voltage to current. The sim-
plest form of the i-v characteristic for a circuit element is a straight line, that is,

i=kv (2.12)

with k being a constant.

Figure 2.27 Volt-ampere characteristic of a tungsten lightbulb

We can also relate the graphical i-v representation of circuit elements to the
power dissipated or generated by a circuit element. For example, the graphical
representation of the lightbulb i-v characteristic of Figure 2.27 illustrates that when
a positive current flows through the bulb, the voltage is positive, and conversely,
a negative current flow corresponds to a negative voltage. In both cases the power
dissipated by the device is a positive quantity, as it should be, on the basis of the
discussion of Section 2.4, since the lightbulb is a passive device. Note that the i-v
characteristic appears in only two of the four possible quadrants in the i-v plane. In
the other two quadrants, the product of voltage and current (i.e., power) is negative,
and an i-v curve with a portion in either of these quadrants therefore corresponds to
power generated. This is not possible for a passive load such as a lightbulb; however,
there are electronic devices that can operate, for example, in three of the four quad-
rants of the i-v characteristic and can therefore act as sources of energy for specific
combinations of voltages and currents. An example of this dual behavior is introduced
in Chapter 9, where it is shown that the photodiode can act either in a passive mode
(as a light sensor) or in an active mode (as a solar cell).

The i-v characteristics of ideal current and voltage sources can also be useful in
visually representing their behavior. An ideal voltage source generates a prescribed
voltage independent of the current drawn from the load; thus, its i-v characteristic
is a straight vertical line with a voltage axis intercept corresponding to the source
voltage. Similarly, the i-v characteristic of an ideal current source is a horizontal line
with a current axis intercept corresponding to the source current. Figure 2.28 depicts
these behaviors.

2.6 RESISTANCE AND OHM’S LAW

When electric current flows through a metal wire or through other circuit elements,
it encounters a certain amount of resistance, the magnitude of which depends on
the electrical properties of the material. Resistance to the flow of current may be
undesired—for example, in the case of lead wires and connection cable—or it may

A useful analogy can be

flow of incompressible fluids
(e.g., water, oil) through

analogy starts with the
observation that the volume
flow rate of a fluid in a pipe is
analogous to current flow in a

drop across the pipe is
analogous to voltage drop
across a resistor. The figure

resistance: The pressure
difference between the two

be exploited in an electric circuit in a useful way. Nevertheless, practically all circuit
elements exhibit some resistance; as a consequence, current flowing through an el-
ement will cause energy to be dissipated in the form of heat. An ideal resistor is a
device that exhibits linear resistance properties according to Ohm’s law, which states
that

V=JIR Ohm’s law (2.13)

that is, that the voltage across an element is directly proportional to the current flow
through it. The value of the resistance R is measured in units of ohms (Q), where

1Q=1V/A (2.14)

The resistance of a material depends on a property called resistivity, denoted by
the symbol p; the inverse of resistivity is called conductivity and is denoted by the
symbol o. For a cylindrical resistance element (shown in Figure 2.29), the resistance
is proportional to the length of the sample / and inversely proportional to its cross-
sectional area A and conductivity o.

Ohm/’s law is an empirical relationship that finds widespread application in
electrical engineering because of its simplicity. It is, however, only an approximation
of the physics of electrically conducting materials. Typically, the linear relationship

between voltage and current in electrical conductors does not apply at very high
voltages and currents. Further, not all electrically conducting materials exhibit linear
behavior even for small voltages and currents. It is usually true, however, that for some
range of voltages and currents, most elements display a linear i-v characteristic. Figure
2.30 illustrates how the linear resistance concept may apply to elements with nonlinear i
i-v characteristics, by graphically defining the linear portion of the i-v characteristic
of two common electrical devices: the lightbulb, which we have already encountered,
and the semiconductor diode, which we study in greater detail in Chapter 9. Table 2.1

resistors used in electronic circuits (e.g., in most consumer electronic appliances such FIND IT
as radios and television sets) is 7 W. Table 2.2 lists the standard values for commonly
used resistors and the color code associated with these values (i.e., the common com-
binations of the digits b, b2b3 as defined in Figure 2.31). For example, if the first three [XMEIES

Chapter 2 Fundamentals of Electric Circuits

In Table 2.2, the leftmost column represents the complete color code; columns
to the right of it only show the third color, since this is the only one that changes. For
example, a 10-2 resistor has the code brown-black-black, while a 100-Q resistor has
the code of brown-black-brown.

In addition to the resistance in ohms, the maximum allowable power dissipation
(or power rating) is typically specified for commercial resistors. Exceeding this
power rating leads to overheating and can cause the resistor to literally burn up. For
a resistor R, the power dissipated can be expressed, with Ohm’s law substituted into
equation 2.10, by

v2
P=VI=LPR= R (2.18)

That is, the power dissipated by a resistor is proportional to the square of the
current flowing through it, as well as the square of the voltage across it. Example
2.10 illustrates how you can make use of the power rating to determine whether a
given resistor will be suitable for a certain application.

Solution
Known Quantities: Resistor power rating = 0.25 W. Battery voltages: 1.5 and 3 V.
Find: The smallest size 1-W resistor that can be connected to each battery.

Part I Circuits

Since the maximum allowable power dissipation is 0.25 W, we can write V7/R < 0.25, or
R > V*/0.25.Thus, fora 1.5-V battery, the minimum size resistor will be R = 1.57/0.25 = 9Q.
For a 3-V battery the minimum size resistor will be R = 37/0.25 = 36 Q.

Comments: Sizing resistors on the basis of power rating is very important in practice. Note
how the minimum resistor size quadrupled as we doubled the voltage across it. This is because
power increases as the square of the voltage. Remember that exceeding power ratings will
inevitably lead to resistor failure!

Open and Short Circuits

Two convenient idealizations of the resistance element are provided by the limiting
cases of Ohm’s law as the resistance of a circuit element approaches zero or infinity. A
circuit element with resistance approaching zero is called a short circuit. Intuitively,
we would expect a short circuit to allow for unimpeded flow of current. In fact,
metallic conductors (e.g., short wires of large diameter) approximate the behavior of
a short circuit. Formally, a short circuit is defined as a circuit element across which
the voltage is zero, regardless of the current flowing through it. Figure 2.34 depicts
the circuit symbol for an ideal short circuit.

Physically, any wire or other metallic conductor will exhibit some resistance,
though small. For practical purposes, however, many elements approximate a short
circuit quite accurately under certain conditions. For example, a large-diameter copper
pipe is effectively a short circuit in the context of a residential electric power supply,

Acircuit element whose resistance approaches infinity is called an open circuit.
Intuitively, we would expect no current to flow through an open circuit, since it offers
infinite resistance to any current. In an open circuit, we would expect to see zero
current regardless of the externally applied voltage. Figure 2.35 illustrates this idea.

In practice, it is not too difficult to approximate an open circuit: Any break in
continuity in a conducting path amounts to an open circuit. The idealization of the open
circuit, as defined in Figure 2.35, does not hold, however, for very high voltages. The
insulating material between two insulated terminals will break down at a sufficiently
high voltage. If the insulator is air, ionized particles in the neighborhood of the two
conducting elements may lead to the phenomenon of arcing; in other words, a pulse of
current may be generated that momentarily jumps a gap between conductors (thanks
to this principle, we are able to ignite the air-fuel mixture in a spark-ignition internal
combustion engine by means of spark plugs). The ideal open and short circuits are
useful concepts and find extensive use in circuit analysis.

Series Resistors and the Voltage Divider Rule

Although electric circuits can take rather complicated forms, even the most involved
circuits can be reduced to combinations of circuit elements in parallel and in series.
Thus, it is important that you become acquainted with parallel and series circuits as
early as possible, even before formally approaching the topic of network analysis.
Parallel and series circuits have a direct relationship with Kirchhoff’s laws. The
objective of this section and the next is to illustrate two common circuits based on
series and parallel combinations of resistors: the voltage and current dividers. These
circuits form the basis of all network analysis; it is therefore important to master these
topics as early as possible.

For an example of a series circuit, refer to the circuit of Figure 2.36, where a
battery has been connected to resistors R;, R2, and R3. The following definition applies:

Part I Circuits

Definition

Two or more circuit elements are said to be in series if the current from one
element exclusively flows into the next element. From KCL, it then follows
that all series elements have the same current.

By applying KVL, you can verify that the sum of the voltages across the three resistors
equals the voltage externally provided by the battery

15V=v, +24 v3

And since, according to Ohm’s law, the separate voltages can be expressed by the
relations

U= iR v2 = iR> vY3= iR3
we can therefore write
1.5 V=i(R; + Ro + R3)

This simple result illustrates a very important principle: To the battery, the three series
resistors appear as a single equivalent resistance of value Rgg, where

Reg = Ri + R2 + R3

The three resistors could thus be replaced by a single resistor of value Reg without
changing the amount of current required of the battery. From this result we may
extrapolate to the more general relationship defining the equivalent resistance of N
series resistors

N
Req = > R,, Equivalent series resistance (2.19)
n=1

which is also illustrated in Figure 2.36. A concept very closely tied to series resistors
is that of the voltage divider. This terminology originates from the observation that
the source voltage in the circuit of Figure 2.36 divides among the three resistors
according to KVL. If we now observe that the series current i is given by

1.5V 1.5V
Reg Ri + Ro + R3

i=

we can write each of the voltages across the resistors as:

R, = 2! (1.5 V)

Chapter 2 Fundamentals of Electric Circuits

That is,

The voltage across each resistor in a series circuit divides in direct proportion
to the individual series resistances.

An instructive exercise consists of verifying that KVL is still satisfied, by adding the
voltage drops around the circuit and equating their sum to the source voltage:

Ri Ry R3
vy tv +03 = —(1.5 V) + ——(1.5 V) + —(1.5V) =1.5V
REQ REQ REQ

since REQ =R,+R.+k3

Therefore, since KVL is satisfied, we are certain that the voltage divider rule is
consistent with Kirchhoff’s laws. By virtue of the voltage divider rule, then, we can
always determine the proportion in which voltage drops are distributed around a
circuit. This result is useful in reducing complicated circuits to simpler forms. The
general form of the voltage divider rule for a circuit with N series resistors and a
voltage source is

Comments: Application of the voltage divider rule to a series circuit is very straightforward.
The difficulty usually arises in determining whether a circuit is in fact a series circuit. This
point is explored later in this section, and in Example 2.13.

CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Repeat Example 2.11 by reversing the reference direction of the current, to show that the same
result is obtained.

Parallel Resistors and the Current Divider Rule

A concept analogous to that of the voltage divider may be developed by applying
Kirchhoff’s current law to a circuit containing only parallel resistances.

Definition

Two or more circuit elements are said to be in parallel if the elements share ( LO4
the same terminals. From KVL, it follows that the elements will have the same
voltage.

Figure 2.38 illustrates the notion of parallel resistors connected to an ideal current
source. Kirchhoff’s current law requires that the sum of the currents into, say, the top
node of the circuit be zero:

is = +i +3
But by virtue of Ohm’s law we may express each current as follows:

. v . U . v
y= n= B=
Ri Ry R3

since, by definition, the same voltage v appears across each element. Kirchhoff’s
current law may then be restated as follows:

Very often in the remainder of this book we refer to the parallel combination of two
or more resistors with the notation

R, || Ro || ---

where the symbol || signifies “in parallel with.”

From the results shown in equations 2.21 and 2.22, which were obtained directly
from KCL, the current divider rule can be easily derived. Consider, again, the three-
resistor circuit of Figure 2.38. From the expressions already derived from each of the
currents 7, i2, and 13, we can write

Comments: While application of the current divider rule to a parallel circuit is very straight-

A method for ensuring that circuit elements are connected in parallel is explored later in this
section, and in Example 2.13.

Verify that KCL is satisfied by the current divider rule and that the source current is divides in
inverse proportion to the parallel resistors Rj, Ro, and R3 in the circuit of Figure 2.39. (This
should not be a surprise, since we would expect to see more current flow through the smaller
resistance.)

Much of the resistive network analysis that is presented in Chapter 3 is based
on the simple principles of voltage and current dividers introduced in this section.
Unfortunately, practical circuits are rarely composed of only parallel or only series
elements. The following examples and Check Your Understanding exercises illustrate
some simple and slightly more advanced circuits that combine parallel and series
elements.

The circuit takes a much simpler appearance once it becomes evident that the same voltage
appears across both R2 and R3 and, therefore, that these elements are in parallel. If these two
resistors are replaced by a single equivalent resistor according to the procedures described in
this section, the circuit of Figure 2.41 is obtained. Note that now the equivalent circuit is a

The Wheatstone bridge is a resistive circuit that is frequently encountered in a variety of
measurement circuits. The general form of the bridge circuit is shown in Figure 2.42(a), where

unknown resistance R,.

1. Find the value of the voltage vg, = Vaa — UVpa in terms of the four resistances and the
source voltage us. Note that since the reference point d is the same for both voltages, we

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: See Figure 2.42.
R, =R), = R3 = 1kQ; Us = 12V; Ugh = 12 mV.

Analysis:

1. First we observe that the circuit consists of the parallel combination of three subcircuits:
the voltage source, the series combination of R; and Ro, and the series combination of R3
and R,. Since these three subcircuits are in parallel, the same voltage will appear across
each of them, namely, the source voltage vs.

Thus, the source voltage divides between each resistor pair R; — Ry and R3; — R,
according to the voltage divider rule: vga is the fraction of the source voltage appearing

EXAMPLE 2.15 Resistance Strain Gauges

Another common application of the resistance concept to engineering measurements is the
resistance strain gauge. Strain gauges are devices that are bonded to the surface of an object,
and whose resistance varies as a function of the surface strain experienced by the object. Strain
gauges may be used to perform measurements of strain, stress, force, torque, and pressure.
Recall that the resistance of a cylindrical conductor of cross-sectional area A, length L, and
conductivity o is given by the expression
L
~ oA

If the conductor is compressed or elongated as a consequence of an external force, its dimen-
sions will change, and with them its resistance. In particular, if the conductor is stretched, its
cross-sectional area decreases and the resistance increases. If the conductor is compressed, its
resistance decreases, since the length L decreases. The relationship between change in resis-
tance and change in length is given by the gauge factor GF, defined by

AR/R
f=
AL/L

And since the strain € is defined as the fractional change in length of an object by the formula

AL
€=—
L
the change in resistance due to an applied strain € is given by
AR = RoGFe

where Ro is the resistance of the strain gauge under no strain and is called the zero strain
resistance. The value of GF for resistance strain gauges made of metal foil is usually
about 2.

Figure 2.43 depicts a typical foil strain gauge. The maximum strain that can be measured
by a foil gauge is about 0.4 to 0.5 percent; that is, AL/L =0.004—0.005. For a 120-Q gauge,this

The foil is formed by a photo-
etching process and is less than

corresponds to a change in resistance on the order of 0.96 to 1.2 Q. Although this change in
resistance is very small, it can be detected by means of suitable circuitry. Resistance strain
gauges are usually connected in a circuit called the Wheatstone bridge, which we analyze later
in this chapter.

Comments—Resistance strain gauges find application in many measurement circuits and
instruments. The measurement of force is one such application, shown next.

EXAMPLE 2.16 The Wheatstone Bridge and Force
Measurements

Strain gauges are frequently employed in the measurement of force. One of the simplest ap-
plications of strain gauges is in the measurement of the force applied to a cantilever beam,
as illustrated in Figure 2.44. Four strain gauges are employed in this case, of which two are
bonded to the upper surface of the beam at a distance L from the point where the external force
F is applied and two are bonded on the lower surface, also at a distance L. Under the influence
of the external force, the beam deforms and causes the upper gauges to extend and the lower
gauges to compress. Thus, the resistance of the upper gauges will increase by an amount AR,
and that of the lower gauges will decrease by an equal amount, assuming that the gauges are
symmetrically placed. Let R; and R4 be the upper gauges and R> and R; the lower gauges.
Thus, under the influence of the external force, we have

2.7 PRACTICAL VOLTAGE AND CURRENT
SOURCES

The idealized models of voltage and current sources we discussed in Section 2.1
fail to consider the internal resistance of practical voltage and current sources. The
objective of this section is to extend the ideal models to models that are capable of
describing the physical limitations of the voltage and current sources used in practice.
Consider, for example, the model of an ideal voltage source shown in Figure 2.1. As
the load resistance R decreases, the source is required to provide increasing amounts
of current to maintain the voltage vs(t) across its terminals:
us (0)

i(t) = R (2.24)

This circuit suggests that the ideal voltage source is required to provide an infinite
amount of current to the load, in the limit as the load resistance approaches zero.
Naturally, you can see that this is impossible; for example, think about the ratings of
a conventional car battery: 12 V, 450 ampere-hours (A-h). This implies that there is
a limit (albeit a large one) to the amount of current a practical source can deliver to

Part I Circuits

a load. Fortunately, it is not necessary to delve too deeply into the physical nature
of each type of source to describe the behavior of a practical voltage source: The
limitations of practical sources can be approximated quite simply by exploiting the
notion of the internal resistance of a source. Although the models described in this
section are only approximations of the actual behavior of energy sources, they will
provide good insight into the limitations of practical voltage and current sources.
Figure 2.45 depicts a model for a practical voltage source, composed of an ideal
voltage source vs in series with a resistance rs. The resistance rs in effect poses a
limit to the maximum current the voltage source can provide:

is max = es (2.25)

rs

Typically, rs is small. Note, however, that its presence affects the voltage across
the load resistance: Now this voltage is no longer equal to the source voltage. Since
the current provided by the source is

Us

is = ——— 2.26
® rs + Rt (2.26)
the load voltage can be determined to be
Ry
vy = isR, = vs ——— 2.27
L = Is hky S rs +R, ( )

Thus, in the limit as the source internal resistance rs approaches zero, the load voltage
uz becomes exactly equal to the source voltage. It should be apparent that a desirable
feature of an ideal voltage source is a very small internal resistance, so that the
current requirements of an arbitrary load may be satisfied. Often, the effective internal
resistance of a voltage source is quoted in the technical specifications for the source,
so that the user may take this parameter into account.

A similar modification of the ideal current source model is useful to describe
the behavior of a practical current source. The circuit illustrated in Figure 2.46 depicts
a simple representation of a practical current source, consisting of an ideal source in
parallel with a resistor. Note that as the load resistance approaches infinity (i.e., an
open circuit), the output voltage of the current source approaches its limit

Us max = Ess (2.28)

A good current source should be able to approximate the behavior of an ideal current
source. Therefore, a desirable characteristic for the internal resistance of a current
source is that it be as large as possible.

2.8 MEASURING DEVICES

In this section, you should gain a basic understanding of the desirable properties
of practical devices for the measurement of electrical parameters. The measure-
ments most often of interest are those of current, voltage, power, and resistance.
In analogy with the models we have just developed to describe the nonideal behav-
ior of voltage and current sources, we similarly present circuit models for practi-
cal measuring instruments suitable for describing the nonideal properties of these
devices.

The ohmmeter is a device that when connected across a circuit element, can mea-
sure the resistance of the element. Figure 2.47 depicts the circuit connection of an
ohmmeter to a resistor. One important rule needs to be remembered:

The resistance of an element can be measured only when the element is discon-
nected from any other circuit.

The Ammeter

The ammeter is a device that when connected in series with a circuit element, can
measure the current flowing through the element. Figure 2.48 illustrates this idea.

From Figure 2.48, two requirements are evident for obtaining a correct measurement
of current:

1. The ammeter must be placed in series with the element whose current is
to be measured (e.g., resistor R2).

2. The ammeter should not restrict the flow of current (i.e., cause a voltage
drop), or else it will not be measuring the true current flowing in the
circuit. An ideal ammeter has zero internal resistance.

The Voltmeter

The voltmeter is a device that can measure the voltage across a circuit element.
Since voltage is the difference in potential between two points in a circuit, the volt-
meter needs to be connected across the element whose voltage we wish to measure.
A voltmeter must also fulfill two requirements:

1. The voltmeter must be placed in parallel with the element whose voltage
it is Measuring.

2. The voltmeter should draw no current away from the element whose
voltage it is measuring, or else it will not be measuring the true voltage

across that element. Thus, an ideal voltmeter has infinite internal
resistance.

Figure 2.49 illustrates these two points.

Figure 2.49 Measurement of voltage

Once again, the definitions just stated for the ideal voltmeter and ammeter need
to be augmented by considering the practical limitations of the devices. A practical
ammeter will contribute some series resistance to the circuit in which it is measuring
current; a practical voltmeter will not act as an ideal open circuit but will always
draw some current from the measured circuit. The homework problems verify that
these practical restrictions do not necessarily pose a limit to the accuracy of the
measurements obtainable with practical measuring devices, as long as the internal
resistance of the measuring devices is known. Figure 2.50 depicts the circuit models
for the practical ammeter and voltmeter.

All the considerations that pertain to practical ammeters and voltmeters can be
applied to the operation of a wattmeter, an instrument that provides a measurement of
the power dissipated by a circuit element, since the wattmeter is in effect made up of a
combination of a voltmeter and an ammeter. Figure 2.51 depicts the typical connection
of a wattmeter in the same series circuit used in the preceding paragraphs. In effect,
the wattmeter measures the current flowing through the load and, simultaneously, the
voltage across it and multiplies the two to provide a reading of the power dissipated
by the load. The internal power consumption of a practical wattmeter is explored in
the homework problems.

Conclusion

The objective of this chapter was to introduce the background needed in the following chap-
ters for the analysis of linear resistive circuits. The following outlines the principal learning
objectives of the chapter.

1.

Identify the principal elements of electric circuits: nodes, loops, meshes, branches, and
voltage and current sources. These elements will be common to all electric circuits
analyzed in the book.

Apply Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws to simple electric circuits and derive the basic circuit
equations. Mastery of these laws is essential to writing the correct equations for electric
circuits.

Apply the passive sign convention and compute the power dissipated by circuit elements.
The passive sign convention is a fundamental skill needed to derive the correct equations
for an electric circuit.

Apply the voltage and current divider laws to calculate unknown variables in simple
series, parallel, and series-parallel circuits. The chapter includes examples of practical
circuits to demonstrate the application of these principles.

Understand the rules for connecting electric measuring instruments to electric circuits
for the measurement of voltage, current, and power. Practical engineering measurement
systems are introduced in these sections.

Batteries do not store electric charge or charge carriers.
Charge carriers (electrons) enter one terminal of the
battery, acquire electrical potential energy, and exit
from the other terminal at a lower voltage. Remember
the electron has a negative charge! It is convenient to
think of positive carriers flowing in the opposite
direction, that is, conventional current, and exiting at a
higher voltage. All currents in this course, unless
otherwise stated, are conventional current. (Benjamin
Franklin caused this mess!) For a battery with a rated

RESISTIVE NETWORK ANALYSIS

hapter 3 illustrates the fundamental techniques for the analysis of resistive

circuits. The chapter begins with the definition of network variables and of

network analysis problems. Next, the two most widely applied methods—node

analysis and mesh analysis—are introduced. These are the most generally
applicable circuit solution techniques used to derive the equations of all electric
circuits; their application to resistive circuits in this chapter is intended to acquaint
you with these methods, which are used throughout the book. The second solution
method presented is based on the principle of superposition, which is applicable only
to linear circuits. Next, the concept of Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits is
explored, which leads to a discussion of maximum power transfer in electric circuits
and facilitates the ensuing discussion of nonlinear loads and /oad-line analysis. At
the conclusion of the chapter, you should have developed confidence in your ability
to compute numerical solutions for a wide range of resistive circuits. The following
box outlines the principal learning objectives of the chapter.

3.1 Network Analysis

The analysis of an electrical network consists of determining each of the unknown
branch currents and node voltages. It is therefore important to define all the rele-
vant variables as clearly as possible, and in systematic fashion. Once the known and
unknown variables have been identified, a set of equations relating these variables
is constructed, and these equations are solved by means of suitable techniques. The
analysis of electric circuits consists of writing the smallest set of equations sufficient
to solve for all the unknown variables. The procedures required to write these equa-
tions are the subject of Chapter 3 and are very well documented and codified in the
form of simple rules. The analysis of electric circuits is greatly simplified if some
standard conventions are followed.

Example 3.1 defines all the voltages and currents that are associated with a
specific circuit.

Figure 3.1

EXAMPLE 3.1

Problem

Identify the branch and node voltages and the loop and mesh currents in the circuit of Figure 3.1.

Solution

The following node voltages may be identified:

Node voltages Branch voltages

Uq = Us (source voltage) vs = Vg — Ug = Va

Ub = UR, UR, = Va — Ub
Ve = UR, UR, = Ub — Ud = Up
vq = 0 (ground) UR, = Up — Ve

UR, = Uc — Ud = Ue

Comments: Currents i,, i,, and i, are loop currents, but only i, and i, are mesh currents.


Part I Circuits

In the example, we have identified a total of 9 variables! It should be clear that
some method is needed to organize the wealth of information that can be generated
simply by applying Ohm’s law at each branch in a circuit. What would be desirable at
this point is ameans of reducing the number of equations needed to solve a circuit to the
minimum necessary, that is, a method for obtaining N equations in N unknowns. The
remainder of the chapter is devoted to the development of systematic circuit analysis
methods that will greatly simplify the solution of electrical network problems.

3.2. THE NODE VOLTAGE METHOD

Node voltage analysis is the most general method for the analysis of electric circuits.
In this section, its application to linear resistive circuits is illustrated. The node voltage
method is based on defining the voltage at each node as an independent variable. One
of the nodes is selected as a reference node (usually—but not necessarily—ground),
and each of the other node voltages is referenced to this node. Once each node voltage
is defined, Ohm’s law may be applied between any two adjacent nodes to determine
the current flowing in each branch. In the node voltage method, each branch current
is expressed in terms of one or more node voltages; thus, currents do not explicitly
enter into the equations. Figure 3.2 illustrates how to define branch currents in this
method. You may recall a similar description given in Chapter 2.

Once each branch current is defined in terms of the node voltages, Kirchhoff’s
current law is applied at each node:

yvi=0

Figure 3.3 illustrates this procedure.

(3.1)

In the node voltage method, we By KCL: ij — iz — i3 = 0. In the node
assign the node voltages vg and vp; voltage method, we express KCL by
the branch current flowing from a Ya=Vb _Vb-=Ve _ Yb~ Yd _¢y

The systematic application of this method to a circuit with n nodes leads to
writing n linear equations. However, one of the node voltages is the reference voltage
and is therefore already known, since it is usually assumed to be zero (recall that
the choice of reference voltage is dictated mostly by convenience, as explained in
Chapter 2). Thus, we can write n — 1 independent linear equations in the n — | inde-
pendent variables (the node voltages). Node analysis provides the minimum number
of equations required to solve the circuit, since any branch voltage or current may be
determined from knowledge of node voltages.

Thermal Systems

A useful analogy can be
found between electric
circuits and thermal systems.
The table below illustrates the
correspondence between
electric circuit variables and
thermal system variables,
showing that the difference in
electrical potential is
analogous to the temperature
difference between two
bodies. Whenever there is a
temperature difference
between two bodies,
Newton’s law of cooling
requires that heat flow from
the warmer body to the
cooler one. The flow of heat
is therefore analogous to the
flow of current. Heat flow can
take place based on one of
three mechanisms:

(1) conduction, (2)
convection, and (3) radiation.
In this sidebar we only
consider the first two, for
simplicity.

Thermal
Resistance

To explain thermal resis-
tance, consider a heat treat-
ed engine crankshaft that has
just completed some thermal
treatment. Assume that the
shaft is to be quenched in a
water bath at ambient
temperature (see the figure
below). Heat flows from
within the shaft to the surface
of the shaft, and then from
he shaft surface to the
water. This process
continues until the tempera-
ure of the shaft is equal to
hat of the water.

The first mode of heat
ransfer in the above descrip-
ion is called conduction, and
it occurs because the thermal
conductivity of steel causes
heat to flow from the higher
temperature inner core to
the lower temperature
surface. The heat-transfer
conduction coefficient k is
analogous to the resistivity p
of an electric conductor.

The second mode of heat
transfer, convection, takes
place at the boundary of
two dissimilar materials (steel
and water here). Heat transfer
between the shaft and water
is dependent on the surface
area of the shaft in contact
with the water A and is de-
termined by the heat transfer
convection coefficient h.

The node analysis method may also be defined as a sequence of steps, as outlined
in the following box:

FOCUS ON METHODOLOGY
NODE VOLTAGE ANALYSIS METHOD

1. Select a reference node (usually ground). This node usually has most
elements tied to it. All other nodes are referenced to this node.

2. Define the remaining n — | node voltages as the independent or dependent
variables. Each of the m voltage sources in the circuit is associated with a
dependent variable. If a node is not connected to a voltage source, then its
voltage is treated as an independent variable.

3. Apply KCL at each node labeled as an independent variable, expressing
each current in terms of the adjacent node voltages.

4. Solve the linear system of n — 1 — m unknowns.

Following the procedure outlined in the box guarantees that the correct solution to a
given circuit will be found, provided that the nodes are properly identified and KCL
is applied consistently. As an illustration of the method, consider the circuit shown in
Figure 3.4. The circuit is shown in two different forms to illustrate equivalent graphical
representations of the same circuit. The circuit on the right leaves no question where
the nodes are. The direction of current flow is selected arbitrarily (assuming that is is
a positive current). Application of KCL at node a yields

is —l) —ib = 0 (3.2)
whereas at node b
io —-23, =0 (3.3)

It is instructive to verify (at least the first time the method is applied) that it is not
necessary to apply KCL at the reference node. The equation obtained at node c,

i) +i3 —is =0 (3.4)
is not independent of equations 3.2 and 3.3; in fact, it may be obtained by adding the

equations obtained at nodes a and b (verify this, as an exercise). This observation
confirms the statement made earlier:

In a circuit containing n nodes, we can write at most n — 1 independent
equations.

Now, in applying the node voltage method, the currents i), i2, and i3 are expressed as
functions of vg, vy, and v,, the independent variables. Ohm’s law requires that 7,, for
example, be given by

Part I Circuits 69

These equations may be solved simultaneously to obtain

v, = —13.57 V
v2 = —52.86 V

Knowing the node voltages, we can determine each of the branch currents and voltages
in the circuit. For example, the current through the 10-kQ resistor is given by

“1 2 3.93 mA

indicating that the initial (arbitrary) choice of direction for this current was the same as
the actual direction of current flow. As another example, consider the current through the
1-kQ resistor:

’l

1,000 3.57m

In this case, the current is negative, indicating that current actually flows from ground
to node 1, as it should, since the voltage at node 1 is negative with respect to ground.
You may continue the branch-by-branch analysis started in this example to verify that the
solution obtained in the example is indeed correct.

Comments: Note that we have chosen to assign a plus sign to currents entering a node and
a minus sign to currents exiting a node; this choice is arbitrary (we could use the opposite
convention), but we shall use it consistently in this book.

Node Analysis with Voltage Sources

In the preceding examples, we considered exclusively circuits containing current

in practice. The circuit of Figure 3.10 is used to illustrate how node analysis is applied
to a circuit containing voltage sources. Once again, we follow the steps outlined in
the Focus on Methodology box.

Step 1: Select a reference node (usually ground). This node usually has most
elements tied to it. All other nodes will be referenced to this node.

The reference node is denoted by the ground symbol in Figure 3.10.

Step 2: Define the remaining n — | node voltages as the independent or dependent

dependent variable. If a node is not connected to a voltage source, then its voltage is
treated as an independent variable.

Next, we define the three node voltages vz, vp, U-, aS Shown in Figure 3.10. We note
that v, is a dependent voltage. We write a simple equation for this dependent voltage,
noting that v, is equal to the source voltage vs: Ug = Us.

Step 3: Apply KCL at each node labeled as an independent variable, expressing
each current in terms of the adjacent node voltages.

2. We define the three node voltages v;, v2, and v3, as shown in Figure 3.11. We note that
v2 and v3 are dependent on each other. One way to represent this dependency is to treat v2

as an independent voltage and to observe that v3 = v2 + 3 V, since the potential at node
3 must be 3 V higher than at node 2 by virtue of the presence of the voltage source. Note
that since we have an expression for the voltage at node 3 in terms of v2, we will only
need to write two nodal equations to solve this three-node circuit.

3. We apply KCL at the two nodes associated with the independent variables v; and v2:

where i=

Rearranging the node 2 equation by substituting the value of i yields

UV, — V2 U2 U3 — Uy U3

4. Finally, we write the system of equations resulting from the application of KCL at the two
nodes associated with independent variables:
—2v, + 1lv.4+ 103 =4 node |
12v, + (—9)v2 + (—10)v3 = 0 node 2

Considering that v3 = v2 +3 V, we write

—2v,; +2vu. = 1
12v, + (—19)vy = 30
The resulting system of the two equations in two unknowns can now be solved. Solving
the two equations for v, and v2 gives
v; = —5.64 V and vo = —5.14V
This provides
v3=2+3V=-2.14V

3.3 THE MESH CURRENT METHOD

The second method of circuit analysis discussed in this chapter employs mesh
currents as the independent variables. The idea is to write the appropriate number of
independent equations, using mesh currents as the independent variables. Subsequent
application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law around each mesh provides the desired system
of equations.

In the mesh current method, we observe that a current flowing through a resistor
in a specified direction defines the polarity of the voltage across the resistor, as illus-
trated in Figure 3.12, and that the sum of the voltages around a closed circuit must
equal zero, by KVL. Once a convention is established regarding the direction of cur-
rent flow around a mesh, simple application of KVL provides the desired equation.
Figure 3.13 illustrates this point.

The number of equations one obtains by this technique is equal to the number of
meshes in the circuit. All branch currents and voltages may subsequently be obtained
from the mesh currents, as will presently be shown. Since meshes are easily identified
in a circuit, this method provides a very efficient and systematic procedure for the
analysis of electric circuits. The following box outlines the procedure used in applying
the mesh current method to a linear circuit.

In mesh analysis, it is important to be consistent in choosing the direction of
current flow. To avoid confusion in writing the circuit equations, unknown mesh cur-
rents are defined exclusively clockwise when we are using this method. To illustrate
the mesh current method, consider the simple two-mesh circuit shown in Figure 3.14.
This circuit is used to generate two equations in the two unknowns, the mesh currents
i; and ip. It is instructive to first consider each mesh by itself. Beginning with mesh 1,
note that the voltages around the mesh have been assigned in Figure 3.15 accord-
ing to the direction of the mesh current i;. Recall that as long as signs are assigned
consistently, an arbitrary direction may be assumed for any current in a circuit; if
the resulting numerical answer for the current is negative, then the chosen reference
direction is opposite to the direction of actual current flow. Thus, one need not be con-
cerned about the actual direction of current flow in mesh analysis, once the directions
of the mesh currents have been assigned. The correct solution will result, eventually.

According to the sign convention, then, the voltages v; and v2 are defined as
shown in Figure 3.15. Now, it is important to observe that while mesh current i; is
equal to the current flowing through resistor R, (and is therefore also the branch current
through R;), it is not equal to the current through R2. The branch current through R
is the difference between the two mesh currents i; — i2. Thus, since the polarity of
voltage vz has already been assigned, according to the convention discussed in the
previous paragraph, it follows that the voltage v2 is given by

v2 = (i, — in) Ro (3.12)
Finally, the complete expression for mesh | is
vs — Ry — Gy — in)R2 = 0 (3.13)

The same line of reasoning applies to the second mesh. Figure 3.16 depicts the
voltage assignment around the second mesh, following the clockwise direction of
mesh current i7. The mesh current iy is also the branch current through resistors R3
and R4; however, the current through the resistor that is shared by the two meshes,
denoted by Ro, is now equal to iz — i,; the voltage across this resistor is

v2 = (iz — i) Ro (3.14)

75

The current i, defined as flowing
from left to right, establishes the
polarity of the voltage across R.

and the complete expression for mesh 2 is
(iz — i1)Ro + 2R3 + Ry =0 (3.15)

Why is the expression for v2 obtained in equation 3.14 different from equation
3.12? The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the voltage assignment for each
mesh was dictated by the (clockwise) mesh current. Thus, since the mesh currents
flow through R» in opposing directions, the voltage assignments for v2 in the two
meshes are also opposite. This is perhaps a potential source of confusion in applying
the mesh current method; you should be very careful to carry out the assignment of
the voltages around each mesh separately.

Combining the equations for the two meshes, we obtain the following system
of equations:

(Ri + Ro)i1 — Roi2z = vs

—Roi, + (Ro + R34 Ry)in = 0

These equations may be solved simultaneously to obtain the desired solution, namely,
the mesh currents 7; and i7. You should verify that knowledge of the mesh currents
permits determination of all the other voltages and currents in the circuit. Examples
3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 further illustrate some of the details of this method.

The circuit of Figure 3.20 is a simplified DC circuit model of a three-wire electrical distribution
service to residential and commercial buildings. The two ideal sources and the resistances R4
and Rs represent the equivalent circuit of the distribution system; R, and R represent 110-V

of one or more mesh currents, we get the following:

Mesh 2:

Mesh 3:

unknown mesh currents.
—(Ri + Rah + Rib = —Vsi
—(R2 + Rs)hbo + Rolg = —Vs2
Ril) + Roly — (Ri + Ro + R3)z = 0

Next, we substitute numerical values for the elements and express the equations in a matrix
form as shown.

which can be expressed as

with a solution of

The solution to the matrix problem can then be carried out using manual or numerical

Mesh Analysis with Current Sources

In the preceding examples, we considered exclusively circuits containing voltage
sources. It is natural to also encounter circuits containing current sources, in prac-
tice. The circuit of Figure 3.21 illustrates how mesh analysis is applied to a circuit
containing current sources. Once again, we follow the steps outlined in the Focus on
Methodology box.

Step 1: Define each mesh current consistently. Unknown mesh currents are always
defined in the clockwise direction; known mesh currents (i.e., when a current source
is present) are always defined in the direction of the current source.

The mesh currents are shown in Figure 3.21. Note that since a current source defines
the current in mesh 2, this (known) mesh current is in the counterclockwise
direction.

Step 2: In a circuit with n meshes and m current sources, n — m independent
equations will result. The unknown mesh currents are the n — m independent
variables.

In this illustration, the presence of the current source has significantly simplified the
problem: There is only one unknown mesh current, and it is i).

Step 3: Apply KVL to each mesh containing an unknown mesh current, expressing
each voltage in terms of one or more mesh currents.

We apply KVL around the mesh containing the unknown mesh current:

the value of the mesh current. Now we turn to meshes 2 and 3 to obtain

3.4 NODE AND MESH ANALYSIS WITH
CONTROLLED SOURCES

The methods just described also apply, with relatively minor modifications, in the
presence of dependent (controlled) sources. Solution methods that allow for the pres-
ence of controlled sources are particularly useful in the study of transistor amplifiers
in Chapters 8 and 9. Recall from the discussion in Section 2.1 that a dependent source
generates a voltage or current that depends on the value of another voltage or current
in the circuit. When a dependent source is present in a circuit to be analyzed by node
or mesh analysis, we can initially treat it as an ideal source and write the node or mesh
equations accordingly. In addition to the equation obtained in this fashion, there is an
equation relating the dependent source to one of the circuit voltages or currents. This
constraint equation can then be substituted in the set of equations obtained by the
techniques of node and mesh analysis, and the equations can subsequently be solved
for the unknowns.

It is important to remark that once the constraint equation has been substi-
tuted in the initial system of equations, the number of unknowns remains unchanged.

Part I Circuits

Figure 3.24 Circuit with dependent source

Consider, for example, the circuit of Figure 3.24, which is a simplified model of a
bipolar transistor amplifier (transistors are introduced in Chapter 9). In the circuit of
Figure 3.24, two nodes are easily recognized, and therefore node analysis is cho-
sen as the preferred method. Applying KCL at node 1, we obtain the following
equation:

Remarks on Node Voltage and Mesh Current Methods

The techniques presented in this section and in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 find use more
generally than just in the analysis of resistive circuits. These methods should be viewed
as general techniques for the analysis of any linear circuit; they provide systematic
and effective means of obtaining the minimum number of equations necessary to
solve a network problem. Since these methods are based on the fundamental laws
of circuit analysis, KVL and KCL, they also apply to electric circuits containing
nonlinear circuit elements, such as those to be introduced later in this chapter.

You should master both methods as early as possible. Proficiency in these circuit
analysis techniques will greatly simplify the learning process for more advanced
concepts.

3.5 THE PRINCIPLE OF SUPERPOSITION

This brief section discusses a concept that is frequently called upon in the analysis
of linear circuits. Rather than a precise analysis technique, like the mesh current and
node voltage methods, the principle of superposition is a conceptual aid that can be
very useful in visualizing the behavior of a circuit containing multiple sources. The
principle of superposition applies to any linear system and for a linear circuit may be
stated as follows:

In a linear circuit containing N sources, each branch voltage and current is the
sum of N voltages and currents, each of which may be computed by setting all
but one source equal to zero and solving the circuit containing that single source.

An elementary illustration of the concept may easily be obtained by simply consid-
ering a circuit with two sources connected in series, as shown in Figure 3.27.
The circuit of Figure 3.27 is more formally analyzed as follows. The current i
flowing in the circuit on the left-hand side of Figure 3.27 may be expressed as
Upi + UB2 VBI UB?

i= R => + R = ig + igo (3.23)

two circuits, each containing a single source. In each of the two subcircuits, a short
circuit has been substituted for the missing battery. This should appear as a sensible
procedure, since a short circuit, by definition, will always “see” zero voltage across
itself, and therefore this procedure is equivalent to “zeroing” the output of one of the
voltage sources.

If, on the other hand, we wished to cancel the effects of a current source, it
would stand to reason that an open circuit could be substituted for the current source,
since an open circuit is, by definition, a circuit element through which no current can
flow (and which therefore generates zero current). These basic principles are used
frequently in the analysis of circuits and are summarized in Figure 3.28.

The principle of superposition can easily be applied to circuits containing mul-
tiple sources and is sometimes an effective solution technique. More often, however,
other methods result in a more efficient solution. Example 3.14 further illustrates
the use of superposition to analyze a simple network. The Check Your Understand-
ing exercises at the end of the section illustrate the fact that superposition is often a
cumbersome solution method.

Given Data: Vs = 10 V; Is = 2A; Ri =5 Q; Ry =2Q; R3 =4Q.
Assumptions: Assume the reference node is at the bottom of the circuit.

Analysis: Part 1: Zero the current source. Once the current source has been set to zero (replaced
by an open circuit), the resulting circuit is a simple series circuit shown in Figure 3.29(b); the
current flowing in this circuit i. y is the current we seek. Since the total series resistance is
5+2+4= 11 Q, we find that i,» = 10/11 = 0.909 A.

Part 2: Zero the voltage source. After we zero the voltage source by replacing it with a
short circuit, the resulting circuit consists of three parallel branches shown in Figure 3.29(c):
On the left we have a single 5-Q resistor; in the center we have a —2-A current source (negative
because the source current is shown to flow into the ground node); on the right we have a total
resistance of 2 + 4 = 6 Q. Using the current divider rule, we find that the current flowing in
the right branch i,_; is given by

3.6 ONE-PORT NETWORKS AND EQUIVALENT
CIRCUITS

You may recall that, in the discussion of ideal sources in Chapter 2, the flow of
energy from a source to a load was described in a very general form, by showing
the connection of two “black boxes” labeled source and load (see Figure 2.2). In the
same figure, two other descriptions were shown: a symbolic one, depicting an ideal
voltage source and an ideal resistor; and a physical representation, in which the load
was represented by a headlight and the source by an automotive battery. Whatever
the form chosen for source-load representation, each block—source or load—may
be viewed as a two-terminal device, described by an i-v characteristic. This general
circuit representation is shown in Figure 3.31. This configuration is called a one-port
network and is particularly useful for introducing the notion of equivalent circuits.
Note that the network of Figure 3.31 is completely described by its i-v characteristic;
this point is best illustrated by Example 3.16.

For the remainder of this section, we focus on developing techniques for com-
puting equivalent representations of linear networks. Such representations are useful
in deriving some simple—yet general—resullts for linear circuits, as well as analyzing
simple nonlinear circuits.

This section discusses one of the most important topics in the analysis of electric
circuits: the concept of an equivalent circuit. We show that it is always possible to

Chapter 3 Resistive Network Analysis

view even a very complicated circuit in terms of much simpler equivalent source and
load circuits, and that the transformations leading to equivalent circuits are easily
managed, with a little practice. In studying node voltage and mesh current analysis,
you may have observed that there is a certain correspondence (called duality) between
current sources and voltage sources, on one hand, and parallel and series circuits, on
the other. This duality appears again very clearly in the analysis of equivalent circuits:
It will shortly be shown that equivalent circuits fall into one of two classes, involving
either voltage or current sources and (respectively) either series or parallel resistors,
reflecting this same principle of duality. The discussion of equivalent circuits begins
with the statement of two very important theorems, summarized in Figures 3.34
and 3.35.

Figure 3.35 Illustration of Norton theorem

The Thévenin Theorem

When viewed from the load, any network composed of ideal voltage and current
sources, and of linear resistors, may be represented by an equivalent circuit
consisting of an ideal voltage source ur in series with an equivalent resistance
Rr.

The Norton Theorem

When viewed from the load, any network composed of ideal voltage and current
sources, and of linear resistors, may be represented by an equivalent circuit
consisting of an ideal current source iy in parallel with an equivalent resistance
Ry.

The first obvious question to arise is, How are these equivalent source voltages,
currents, and resistances computed? The next few sections illustrate the computation
of these equivalent circuit parameters, mostly through examples. A substantial number
of Check Your Understanding exercises are also provided, with the following caution:
The only way to master the computation of Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits
is by patient repetition.

Part I Circuits

Determination of Norton or Thévenin Equivalent
Resistance

In this subsection, we illustrate the calculation of the equivalent resistance of anetwork
containing only linear resistors and independent sources. The first step in computing
a Thévenin or Norton equivalent circuit consists of finding the equivalent resistance
presented by the circuit at its terminals. This is done by setting all sources in the circuit
equal to zero and computing the effective resistance between terminals. The voltage
and current sources present in the circuit are set to zero by the same technique used
with the principle of superposition: Voltage sources are replaced by short circuits;
current sources, by open circuits. To illustrate the procedure, consider the simple
circuit of Figure 3.36; the objective is to compute the equivalent resistance the load
R, “sees” at port a-b.

To compute the equivalent resistance, we remove the load resistance from the
circuit and replace the voltage source vs by a short circuit. At this point—seen from
the load terminals—the circuit appears as shown in Figure 3.37. You can see that
R, and R> are in parallel, since they are connected between the same two nodes. If
the total resistance between terminals a and b is denoted by R7, its value can be
determined as follows:

Rr =R3+4+R, || Ro (3.24)

An alternative way of viewing Rr is depicted in Figure 3.38, where a hypo-
thetical 1-A current source has been connected to terminals a and b. The voltage
Ux appearing across the a-b pair is then numerically equal to Rr (only because is
= 1 A!). With the 1-A source current flowing in the circuit, it should be apparent that
the source current encounters R3 as a resistor in series with the parallel combination
of R; and Ro, prior to completing the loop.

Summarizing the procedure, we can produce a set of simple rules as an aid in
the computation of the Thévenin (or Norton) equivalent resistance for a linear resis-
tive circuit that does not contain dependent sources. The case of circuits containing
dependent sources is outlined later in this section.

COMPUTATION OF EQUIVALENT RESISTANCE OF A ONE-PORT
NETWORK THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN DEPENDENT SOURCES

1. Remove the load.
2. Zero all independent voltage and current sources.

3. Compute the total resistance between load terminals, with the load
removed. This resistance is equivalent to that which would be encountered
by a current source connected to the circuit in place of the load.

We note immediately that this procedure yields a result that is independent of
the load. This is a very desirable feature, since once the equivalent resistance has been
identified for a source circuit, the equivalent circuit remains unchanged if we connect
a different load. The following examples further illustrate the procedure.

As a final note, the Thévenin and Norton equivalent resistances are one and the
same quantity:

Rr = Rn (3.25)

Therefore, the preceding discussion holds whether we wish to compute a Norton or
a Thévenin equivalent circuit. From here on, we use the notation Rr; exclusively, for
both Thévenin and Norton equivalents.

Computing the Thévenin Voltage

This section describes the computation of the Thévenin equivalent voltage vy for an
arbitrary linear resistive circuit containing independent voltage and current sources
and linear resistors. The Thévenin equivalent voltage is defined as follows:

The equivalent (Thévenin) source voltage is equal to the open-circuit voltage
present at the load terminals (with the load removed).

This states that to compute vz, it is sufficient to remove the load and to compute
the open-circuit voltage at the one-port terminals. Figure 3.43 illustrates that the open-
circuit voltage voc and the Thévenin voltage vy must be the same if the Thévenin
theorem is to hold. This is true because in the circuit consisting of vr and R7, the
voltage voc must equal v7, since no current flows through R7z and therefore the voltage
across Rr is zero. Kirchhoff’s voltage law confirms that

vr = Rr(O) + Voc = Voc (3.26)

( LO4

Part I Circuits

FOCUS ON METHODOLOGY
COMPUTING THE THEVENIN VOLTAGE

1. Remove the load, leaving the load terminals open-circuited.

2. Define the open-circuit voltage voc across the open load terminals.
3. Apply any preferred method (e.g., node analysis) to solve for voc.
4. The Thévenin voltage is vr = voc.

The actual computation of the open-circuit voltage is best illustrated by exam-
ples; there is no substitute for practice in becoming familiar with these computations.
To summarize the main points in the computation of open-circuit voltages, consider
the circuit of Figure 3.36, shown again in Figure 3.44 for convenience. Recall that
the equivalent resistance of this circuit was given by Rr = R3 +R, || Ro. To compute
Voc, we disconnect the load, as shown in Figure 3.45, and immediately observe that
no current flows through R3, since there is no closed-circuit connection at that branch.
Therefore, voc must be equal to the voltage across Ro, as illustrated in Figure 3.46.
Since the only closed circuit is the mesh consisting of vs, R,, and R2, the answer we
are seeking may be obtained by means of a simple voltage divider:

Ry
vs ————
Ri +R.

It is instructive to review the basic concepts outlined in the example by con-

sidering the original circuit and its Thévenin equivalent side by side, as shown in

Figure 3.47. The two circuits of Figure 3.47 are equivalent in the sense that the
current drawn by the load i, is the same in both circuits, that current being given by

Assumptions: Assume the reference node is at the bottom of the circuit.

Analysis: Following the Thévenin voltage Focus on Methodology box, first we remove the
load and label the open-circuit voltage voc. Next, we observe that since v, is equal to the
reference voltage (1.e., zero), the node voltage v, will be equal, numerically, to the open-circuit
voltage. If we define the other node voltage to be v, node analysis is the natural technique
for arriving at the solution. Figure 3.48 depicts the original circuit ready for node analysis.
Applying KCL at the two nodes, we obtain the following two equations:

V-v v U— Ug

Voc = Vg — Up = 7.059 V.

Comments: Note that the determination of the Thévenin voltage is nothing more than the
careful application of the basic circuit analysis methods presented in earlier sections. The only
difference is that we first need to properly identify and define the open-circuit load voltage.

Find: Load current i.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: V = 24V;I1 =3A;R; =4Q;

posed earlier, we zero the two sources by shorting the voltage source and opening the current

Rr = R,||Ry = 4|[12 =3 Q.

Following the Thévenin voltage Focus on Methodology box, first we remove the load
and label the open-circuit voltage voc. The circuit is shown in Figure 3.51. Next, we observe
that since v, is equal to the reference voltage (i.e., zero), the node voltage v, will be equal,
numerically, to the open-circuit voltage. In this circuit, a single nodal equation is required to
arrive at the solution:

V—-—v, Vg

Substituting numerical values, we find that vz = voc = vr = 27 V.
Finally, we assemble the Thévenin equivalent circuit, shown in Figure 3.52, and reconnect

Comments: It may appear that the calculation of load current by the Thévenin equivalent
method leads to more complex calculations than, say, node voltage analysis (you might wish
to try solving the same circuit by node analysis to verify this). However, there is one major
advantage to equivalent circuit analysis: Should the load change (as is often the case in many
practical engineering situations), the equivalent circuit calculations still hold, and only the
(trivial) last step in the above example needs to be repeated. Thus, knowing the Thévenin
equivalent of a particular circuit can be very useful whenever we need to perform computations
pertaining to any load quantity.

Computing the Norton Current

The computation of the Norton equivalent current is very similar in concept to that
of the Thévenin voltage. The following definition serves as a starting point:

Definition

The Norton equivalent current is equal to the short-circuit current that would
flow if the load were replaced by a short circuit.

An explanation for the definition of the Norton current is easily found by considering,
again, an arbitrary one-port network, as shown in Figure 3.53, where the one-port
network is shown together with its Norton equivalent circuit.

It should be clear that the current isc flowing through the short circuit replacing
the load is exactly the Norton current iy, since all the source current in the circuit of
Figure 3.53 must flow through the short circuit. Consider the circuit of Figure 3.54,
shown with a short circuit in place of the load resistance. Any of the techniques
presented in this chapter could be employed to determine the current isc. In this
particular case, mesh analysis is a convenient tool, once it is recognized that the
short-circuit current is a mesh current. Let i, and i. = isc be the mesh currents in the
circuit of Figure 3.54. Then the following mesh equations can be derived and solved
for the short-circuit current:

(Ri + R2)i; — Roisc = vs
—Roi, + (Ro + R3)isc = 0

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: V = 6 V;] =2A;R; =6Q; Rp =3 Q;

Assumptions: Assume the reference node is at the bottom of the circuit.

Analysis: We first compute the Thévenin equivalent resistance. We zero the two sources by
shorting the voltage source and opening the current source. The resulting circuit is shown in
Figure 3.56. We can clearly see that Rr = R,||Ry + R3 = 6/3 +2 =4Q.

Next we compute the Norton current. Following the Norton current Focus on Methodology
box, first we replace the load with a short circuit and label the short-circuit current igc. The
circuit is shown in Figure 3.57 ready for node voltage analysis. Note that we have identified two
node voltages v; and v2, and that the voltage source requires that v2 — v; = V. The unknown
current flowing through the voltage source is labeled i.

Now we are ready to apply the node analysis method.

1. The reference node is the ground node in Figure 3.57.

2. The two nodes v, and v2 are also identified in the figure; note that the voltage source
imposes the constraint v2 = v; + V. Thus only one of the two nodes leads to an indepen-
dent equation. The unknown current i provides the second independent variable, as you
will see in the next step.

Next, we eliminate v, by substituting v; = v2 — V in the first equation:

v2 —V

and we rewrite the equations in matrix form, recognizing that the unknowns are i and v2.

and we can numerically solve for the two unknowns to find that i = 2.5 Aand v. = 3 V.
Finally, the Norton or short-circuit current is iy = igc = U2/R3 = 1.5 A.

Comments: In this example it was not obvious whether node analysis, mesh analysis, or
superposition might be the quickest method to arrive at the answer. It would be a very good
exercise to try the other two methods and compare the complexity of the three solutions. The
complete Norton equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 3.58.

Source Transformations

This section illustrates source transformations, a procedure that may be very useful
in the computation of equivalent circuits, permitting, in some circumstances, replace-
ment of current sources with voltage sources and vice versa. The Norton and Thévenin
theorems state that any one-port network can be represented by a voltage source in
series with a resistance, or by a current source in parallel with a resistance, and that
either of these representations is equivalent to the original circuit, as illustrated in
Figure 3.59.

An extension of this result is that any circuit in Thévenin equivalent form may
be replaced by a circuit in Norton equivalent form, provided that we use the following
relationship:

Thus, the subcircuit to the left of the dashed line in Figure 3.60 may be replaced by its
Norton equivalent, as shown in the figure. Then the computation of is. becomes very
straightforward, since the three resistors are in parallel with the current source and
therefore a simple current divider may be used to compute the short-circuit current.
Observe that the short-circuit current is the current flowing through R3; therefore,

which is the identical result obtained for the same circuit in the preceding section,
as you may easily verify. This source transformation method can be very useful, if
employed correctly. Figure 3.61 shows how to recognize subcircuits amenable to
such source transformations. Example 3.22 is a numerical example illustrating the
procedure.

Assumptions: Assume the reference node is at the bottom of the circuit.

Analysis: First, we sketch the circuit again, to take advantage of the source transformation
technique; we emphasize the location of the nodes for this purpose, as shown in Figure 3.63.
Nodes a’ and b’ have been purposely separated from nodes a” and b” even though these are the
same pairs of nodes. We can now replace the branch consisting of V; and R;, which appears
between nodes a” and b”, with an equivalent Norton circuit with Norton current source V; /R;
and equivalent resistance R,. Similarly, the series branch between nodes a’ and b’ is replaced
by an equivalent Norton circuit with Norton current source V2/R3 and equivalent resistance
R;. The result of these manipulations is shown in Figure 3.64. The same circuit is now depicted
in Figure 3.65 with numerical values substituted for each component. Note how easy it is to
visualize the equivalent resistance: If each current source is replaced by an open circuit, we find

Rr = R,||Ro||R3|| + R¢ = 200]|100]|100 + 160 = 200 Q

Figure 3.65

Part I Circuits

The final step consists of adding the three currents (—0.025 A) and combining the three
parallel resistors into a single 40-Q resistor. A further source transformation from Norton to
Thévenin permits the addition of the 40-Q resistor to the 160-Q resistor. Finally, transforming
back to Norton we have the final value of the Norton current to be —0.005 A. The final circuit
is shown in Figure 3.66.

Comments: It is not always possible to reduce a circuit as easily as was shown in this
example by means of source transformations. However, it may be advantageous to use source
transformation as a means of converting parts of a circuit to a different form, perhaps more
naturally suited to a particular solution method (e.g., node analysis).

Experimental Determination of Thévenin and
Norton Equivalents

The idea of equivalent circuits as a means of representing complex and sometimes
unknown networks is useful not only analytically, but in practical engineering appli-
cations as well. It is very useful to have a measure, for example, of the equivalent
internal resistance of an instrument, so as to have an idea of its power requirements
and limitations. Fortunately, Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits can also be
evaluated experimentally by means of very simple techniques. The basic idea is that
the Thévenin voltage is an open-circuit voltage and the Norton current is a short-
circuit current. It should therefore be possible to conduct appropriate measurements
to determine these quantities. Once vr and iy are known, we can determine the
Thévenin resistance of the circuit being analyzed according to the relationship

Rp = (3.30)
IN
How are vz and iy measured, then?

Figure 3.67 illustrates the measurement of the open-circuit voltage and short-
circuit current for an arbitrary network connected to any load and also illustrates that
the procedure requires some special attention, because of the nonideal nature of any
practical measuring instrument. The figure clearly illustrates that in the presence of
finite meter resistance 7,,, one must take this quantity into account in the computation
of the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage; voc and isc appear between
quotation marks in the figure specifically to illustrate that the measured “open-circuit
voltage” and “short-circuit current” are in fact affected by the internal resistance of
the measuring instrument and are not the true quantities.

You should verify that the following expressions for the true short-circuit current
and open-circuit voltage apply (see the material on nonideal measuring instruments
in Section 2.8):

(3.31)

where iy is the ideal Norton current, vy is the Thévenin voltage, and R7 is the true
Thévenin resistance. If you recall the earlier discussion of the properties of ideal
ammeters and voltmeters, you will recall that for an ideal ammeter, r,, should approach
zero, while in an ideal voltmeter, the internal resistance should approach an open

circuit (infinity); thus, the two expressions just given permit the determination of
the true Thévenin and Norton equivalent sources from an (imperfect) measurement
of the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current, provided that the internal meter
resistance r,, is known. Note also that, in practice, the internal resistance of voltmeters
is sufficiently high to be considered infinite relative to the equivalent resistance of
most practical circuits; on the other hand, it is impossible to construct an ammeter that
has zero internal resistance. If the internal ammeter resistance is known, however, a
reasonably accurate measurement of short-circuit current may be obtained.

One last comment is in order concerning the practical measurement of the inter-
nal resistance of a network. In most cases, it is not advisable to actually short circuit
a network by inserting a series ammeter as shown in Figure 3.67; permanent damage
to the circuit or to the ammeter may be a consequence. For example, imagine that
you wanted to estimate the internal resistance of an automotive battery; connecting
a laboratory ammeter between the battery terminals would surely result in immedi-
ate loss of the instrument. Most ammeters are not designed to withstand currents of
such magnitude. Thus, the experimenter should pay attention to the capabilities of
the ammeters and voltmeters used in measurements of this type, as well as to the
(approximate) power ratings of any sources present. However, there are established
techniques especially designed to measure large currents.

3.7 MAXIMUM POWER TRANSFER

The reduction of any linear resistive circuit to its Thévenin or Norton equivalent
form is a very convenient conceptualization, as far as the computation of load-related
quantities is concerned. One such computation is that of the power absorbed by the

Part I Circuits

load. The Thévenin and Norton models imply that some of the power generated by
the source will necessarily be dissipated by the internal circuits within the source.
Given this unavoidable power loss, a logical question to ask is, How much power
can be transferred to the load from the source under the most ideal conditions? Or,
alternatively, what is the value of the load resistance that will absorb maximum power
from the source? The answer to these questions is contained in the maximum power
transfer theorem, which is the subject of this section.

The model employed in the discussion of power transfer is illustrated in
Figure 3.68, where a practical source is represented by means of its Thévenin equiva-
lent circuit. The maximum power transfer problem is easily formulated if we consider
that the power absorbed by the load P; is given by

P, =icR, (3.32)
and that the load current is given by the familiar expression

UT

i, = ———_— 3.33
* Rit Rr 689)
Combining the two expressions, we can compute the load power as
vi
P, = ———— R 3.34
Y (RL+Rr)? G34)

To find the value of R; that maximizes the expression for P; (assuming that V7 and
Rr are fixed), the simple maximization problem

dP,
— =0 3.35
aR, (3.35)

must be solved. Computing the derivative, we obtain the following expression:

dP, v7(Ry + Rr)? — 2v7R, (Ri + Rr)

dR, (R, + Rr)* (3.36)
which leads to the expression

(Ry + Rr)” — 2Ri(Ri + Rr) = 0 (3.37)
It is easy to verify that the solution of this equation is

Ry, = Rr (3.38)

Thus, to transfer maximum power to a load, the equivalent source and load resistances
must be matched, that is, equal to each other. Figure 3.69 depicts a plot of the load

This analysis shows that to transfer maximum power to a load, given a fixed
equivalent source resistance, the load resistance must match the equivalent source
resistance. What if we reversed the problem statement and required that the load
resistance be fixed? What would then be the value of source resistance that maximizes
the power transfer in this case? The answer to this question can be easily obtained by
solving the Check Your Understanding exercises at the end of the section.

A problem related to power transfer is that of source loading. This phenomenon,
which is illustrated in Figure 3.70, may be explained as follows: When a practical
voltage source is connected to a load, the current that flows from the source to the
load will cause a voltage drop across the internal source resistance Vj; aS a conse-
quence, the voltage actually seen by the load will be somewhat lower than the open-
circuit voltage of the source. As stated earlier, the open-circuit voltage is equal to the
Thévenin voltage. The extent of the internal voltage drop within the source depends
on the amount of current drawn by the load. With reference to Figure 3.71, this internal
drop is equal to iR;, and therefore the load voltage will be

UL = UT — IRr (3.39)

It should be apparent that it is desirable to have as small an internal resistance as
possible in a practical voltage source.

In the case of a current source, the internal resistance will draw some current
away from the load because of the presence of the internal source resistance; this
current is denoted by i,,, in Figure 3.70. Thus the load will receive only part of the
short-circuit current available from the source (the Norton current):

Source Load

It is therefore desirable to have a very large internal resistance in a practical current
source. You may wish to refer to the discussion of practical sources to verify that the
earlier interpretation of practical sources can be expanded in light of the more recent
discussion of equivalent circuits.

EXAMPLE 3.23 Maximum Power Transfer

Use the maximum power transfer theorem to determine the increase in power delivered to a
loudspeaker resulting from matching the speaker load resistance to the amplifier equivalent

Assumptions: The amplifier can be modeled as a linear resistive circuit, for the purposes of
this analysis.

Analysis: Imagine that we have unknowingly connected an 8-Q amplifier to a 16-Q speaker.
We can compute the power delivered to the speaker as follows. The load voltage is found by
using the voltage divider rule:

3.8. NONLINEAR CIRCUIT ELEMENTS

Until now the focus of this chapter has been on linear circuits, containing ideal voltage
and current sources, and linear resistors. In effect, one reason for the simplicity of some
of the techniques illustrated earlier is the ability to utilize Ohm’s law as a simple, linear
description of the i-v characteristic of an ideal resistor. In many practical instances,
however, the engineer is faced with elements exhibiting a nonlinear i-v characteristic.
This section explores two methods for analyzing nonlinear circuit elements.

Description of Nonlinear Elements

There are a number of useful cases in which a simple functional relationship exists
between voltage and current in a nonlinear circuit element. For example, Figure 3.72

Part I Circuits

depicts an element with an exponential i-v characteristic, described by the following
equations:

i= Ipe®” v>0

3.41
i=-—Ip v <0 ( )

There exists, in fact, a circuit element (the semiconductor diode) that very nearly
satisfies this simple relationship. The difficulty in the i-v relationship of equation
3.41 is that it is not possible, in general, to obtain a closed-form analytical solution,
even for a very simple circuit.

With the knowledge of equivalent circuits you have just acquired, one approach
to analyzing a circuit containing a nonlinear element might be to treat the nonlinear
element as a load and to compute the Thévenin equivalent of the remaining circuit, as
shown in Figure 3.73. Applying KVL, the following equation may then be obtained:

To obtain the second equation needed to solve for both the unknown voltage v,
and the unknown current i,, it is necessary to resort to the i-v description of the
nonlinear element, namely, equation 3.41. If, for the moment, only positive voltages
are considered, the circuit is completely described by the following system:

Vy

iy = Ihe Ux > 0

3.43
Ur = Rrix + Uy (

The two parts of equation 3.43 represent a system of two equations in two unknowns;
however, one of these equations is nonlinear. If we solve for the load voltage and
current, for example, by substituting the expression for i, in the linear equation, we
obtain the following expression:

vp = Rrlbe*™ + ry (3.44)
or
Vy = UT — Rrlpe*™ (3.45)

Equations 3.44 and 3.45 do not have a closed-form solution; that is, they are tran-
scendental equations. How can v, be found? One possibility is to generate a solution
numerically, by guessing an initial value (for example, v, = 0) and iterating until a
sufficiently precise solution is found. This solution is explored further in the home-
work problems. Another method is based on a graphical analysis of the circuit and is
described in the following section.

Graphical (Load-Line) Analysis of Nonlinear Circuits

The nonlinear system of equations of the previous section may be analyzed in a
different light, by considering the graphical representation of equation 3.42, which
may also be written as

Figure 3.75 Graphical solution of equations 3.44 and 3.45

We notice, first, that equation 3.46 describes the behavior of any load, linear or
nonlinear, since we have made no assumptions regarding the nature of the load voltage
and current. Second, it is the equation of a line in the i,v, plane, with slope —1/Rr
and i, intercept V;/Rr. This equation is referred to as the load-line equation; its
graphical interpretation is very useful and is shown in Figure 3.74.

The load-line equation is but one of two i-v characteristics we have available,
the other being the nonlinear-device characteristic of equation 3.41. The intersection
of the two curves yields the solution of our nonlinear system of equations. This result
is depicted in Figure 3.75.

Finally, another important point should be emphasized: The linear network
reduction methods introduced in the preceding sections can always be employed to
reduce any circuit containing a single nonlinear element to the Thévenin equivalent
form, as illustrated in Figure 3.76. The key is to identify the nonlinear element and to
treat it as a load. Thus, the equivalent-circuit solution methods developed earlier can
be very useful in simplifying problems in which a nonlinear load is present. Examples
3.24 and 3.25 further illustrate the load-line analysis method.

Find: Power dissipated by load P,.
Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: Ry; = 30 Q; vr = 15 V.
Assumptions: None.

Analysis: We can model the circuit as shown in Figure 3.76. The objective is to determine the
voltage v, and the current i,, using graphical methods. The load-line equation for the circuit is
given by the expression

or

k= ~ 390 + 30

This equation represents a line in the i, v, plane, with i, intercept at 0.5 A and v, intercept at 15 V.
To determine the operating point of the circuit, we superimpose the load line on the device i-v
characteristic, as shown in Figure 3.77, and determine the solution by finding the intersection
of the load line with the device curve. Inspection of the graph reveals that the intersection point
is given approximately by

i, =0.14A vy, = 11V
and therefore the power dissipated by the nonlinear load is
P,=0.14 x 11=1.54W

It is important to observe that the result obtained in this example is, in essence, a description
of experimental procedures, indicating that the analytical concepts developed in this chapter
also apply to practical measurements.

Conclusion

The objective of this chapter is to provide a practical introduction to the analysis of linear
resistive circuits. The emphasis on examples is important at this stage, since we believe that
familiarity with the basic circuit analysis techniques will greatly ease the task of learning more
advanced ideas in circuits and electronics. In particular, your goal at this point should be to
have mastered six analysis methods, summarized as follows:

1.,2. Node voltage and mesh current analysis. These methods are analogous in concept;
the choice of a preferred method depends on the specific circuit. They are generally
applicable to the circuits we analyze in this book and are amenable to solution by
matrix methods.

3. The principle of superposition. This is primarily a conceptual aid that may simplify the
solution of circuits containing multiple sources. It is usually not an efficient method.

4. Thévenin and Norton equivalents. The notion of equivalent circuits is at the heart of
circuit analysis. Complete mastery of the reduction of linear resistive circuits to either
equivalent form is a must.

5. Maximum Power transfer. Equivalent circuits provide a very clear explanation of how
power is transferred from a source to a load.

6. Numerical and graphical analysis. These methods apply in the case of nonlinear
circuit elements. The load-line analysis method is intuitively appealing and is
employed again in this book to analyze electronic devices.

The material covered in this chapter is essential to the development of more advanced
techniques throughout the remainder of the book.

AC NETWORK ANALYSIS

hapter 4 is dedicated to two main ideas: energy storage (dynamic) circuit

elements and the analysis of AC circuits excited by sinusoidal voltages and

currents. First, dynamic circuit elements, that is, capacitors and inductors, are

defined. These are circuit elements that are described by an i-v characteristic
of differential or integral form. Next, time-dependent signal sources and the concepts
of average and root-mean-square (rms) values are introduced. Special emphasis is
placed on sinusoidal signals, as this class of signals is especially important in the
analysis of electric circuits (think, e.g., of the fact that all electric power for residential
and industrial uses comes in sinusoidal form). Once these basic elements have been
presented, the focus shifts to how to write circuit equations when time-dependent
sources and dynamic elements are present. The equations that result from the application
of KVL and KCL take the form of differential equations. The general solution of
these differential equations is covered in Chapter 5. The remainder of the chapter
discusses one particular case: the solution of circuit differential equations when the
excitation is a sinusoidal voltage or current; a very powerful method, phasor anal-
ysis, is introduced along with the related concept of impedance. This methodology
effectively converts the circuit differential equations to algebraic equations in which
complex algebra notation is used to arrive at the solution. Phasor analysis is then used to

We continue the analogy
between electrical and
hydraulic circuits. If a vessel
has some elasticity, energy is
stored in the expansion and
contraction of the vessel
walls (this should remind you
of a mechanical spring). This
phenomenon gives rise to a
fluid capacitance effect very
similar to electrical
capacitance. The energy
stored in the compression
and expansion of the gas is
of the potential energytype.

4.1 ENERGY STORAGE (DYNAMIC) CIRCUIT

ELEMENTS

The ideal resistor was introduced through Ohm’s law in Chapter 2 as a useful
idealization of many practical electrical devices. However, in addition to resistance
to the flow of electric current, which is purely a dissipative (i.e., an energy loss)
phenomenon, electric devices may exhibit energy storage properties, much in the same
way as a spring or a flywheel can store mechanical energy. Two distinct mechanisms
for energy storage exist in electric circuits: capacitance and inductance, both of
which lead to the storage of energy in an electromagnetic field. For the purpose
of this discussion, it will not be necessary to enter into a detailed electromagnetic
analysis of these devices. Rather, two ideal circuit elements will be introduced to
represent the ideal properties of capacitive and inductive energy storage: the ideal
capacitor and the ideal inductor. It should be stated clearly that ideal capacitors
and inductors do not exist, strictly speaking; however, just like the ideal resistor,
these “ideal” elements are very useful for understanding the behavior of physical
circuits. In practice, any component of an electric circuit will exhibit some resistance,
some inductance, and some capacitance—that is, some energy dissipation and some
energy storage. The sidebar on hydraulic analogs of electric circuits illustrates that
the concept of capacitance does not just apply to electric circuits.

The Ideal Capacitor

A physical capacitor is a device that can store energy in the form of a charge separation
when appropriately polarized by an electric field (i.e., a voltage). The simplest
capacitor configuration consists of two parallel conducting plates of cross-sectional
area A, separated by air (or another dielectric! material, such as mica or Teflon).
Figure 4.2 depicts a typical configuration and the circuit symbol for a capacitor.

'A dielectric material is a material that is not an electrical conductor but contains a large number of
electric dipoles, which become polarized in the presence of an electric field.

Part I Circuits

The presence of an insulating material between the conducting plates does not
allow for the flow of DC current; thus, a capacitor acts as an open circuit in the
presence of DC current. However, if the voltage present at the capacitor terminals
changes as a function of time, so will the charge that has accumulated at the two
capacitor plates, since the degree of polarization is a function of the applied electric
field, which is time-varying. In a capacitor, the charge separation caused by the polar-
ization of the dielectric is proportional to the external voltage, that is, to the applied
electric field

Q=CV (4.1)

where the parameter C is called the capacitance of the element and is a measure of
the ability of the device to accumulate, or store, charge. The unit of capacitance is
coulomb per volt and is called the farad (F). The farad is an unpractically large
unit for many common electronic circuit applications; therefore it is common to
use microfarads (1 w.F = 10~° F) or picofarads (1 pF = 10-'? F). From equa-
tion 4.1 it becomes apparent that if the external voltage applied to the capacitor
plates changes in time, so will the charge that is internally stored by the capaci-
tor:

q(t) = Cv(t) (4.2)

Thus, although no current can flow through a capacitor if the voltage across it is
constant, a time-varying voltage will cause charge to vary in time.

The change with time in the stored charge is analogous to a current. You can
easily see this by recalling the definition of current given in Chapter 2, where it was
stated that

i(t) = aa)

dt

that is, electric current corresponds to the time rate of change of charge. Differentiating
equation 4.2, one can obtain a relationship between the current and voltage in a
capacitor:

(4.3)

dv(t)
dt

i(t)=C i-v relation for capacitor (4.4)

Equation 4.4 is the defining circuit law for a capacitor. If the differential equation that
defines the i-v relationship for a capacitor is integrated, one can obtain the following
relationship for the voltage across a capacitor:

t
uc(t) = I / ic (t')dt' (4.5)
C I-00
Equation 4.5 indicates that the capacitor voltage depends on the past current through
the capacitor, up until the present time t. Of course, one does not usually have precise
information regarding the flow of capacitor current for all past time, and so it is useful
to define the initial voltage (or initial condition) for the capacitor according to the
following, where fo is an arbitrary initial time:

The capacitor voltage is now given by the expression

1 t
ve = a / ic(t’) dt +Vy t=" (4.7)

to

The significance of the initial voltage Vo is simply that at time fg some charge is stored
in the capacitor, giving rise to a voltage vc (fo), according to the relationship Q = CV.
Knowledge of this initial condition is sufficient to account for the entire history of
the capacitor current.

Capacitors connected in series and parallel can be combined to yield a single
equivalent capacitance. The rule of thumb, which is illustrated in Figure 4.3, is the
following:

Capacitors in parallel add. Capacitors in series combine according to the same
rules used for resistors connected in parallel.

It is very easy to prove that capacitors in series combine as shown in
Figure 4.3, using the definition of equation 4.5. Consider the three capacitors in
series in the circuit of Figure 4.3. Using Kirchhoff’s voltage law and the definition of
the capacitor voltage, we can write

v(t) = u(t) + vit) + vit)

Thus, the voltage across the three series capacitors is the same as would be seen
across a single equivalent capacitor C,, with 1/C., = 1/C, + 1/C, + 1/C3, as
illustrated in Figure 4.3. You can easily use the same method to prove that the
three parallel capacitors in the bottom half of Figure 4.3 combine as do resistors
in series.

EXAMPLE 4.1 Charge Separation in Ultracapacitors

Problem

Ultracapacitors are finding application in a variety of fields, including as a replacement or
supplement for batteries in hybrid-electric vehicles. In this example you will make your first
acquaintance with these devices.

An ultracapacitor, or “supercapacitor,” stores energy electrostatically by polarizing an
electrolytic solution. Although it is an electrochemical device (also known as an electrochemical
double-layer capacitor), there are nochemical reactions involvedinits energy storage mechanism.
This mechanism is highly reversible, allowing the ultracapacitor to be charged and discharged
hundreds of thousands of times. An ultracapacitor can be viewed as two nonreactive porous

( LO1

Part I Circuits

plates suspended within an electrolyte, with a voltage applied across the plates. The applied
potential on the positive plate attracts the negative ions in the electrolyte, while the potential
on the negative plate attracts the positive ions. This effectively creates two layers of capacitive
storage, one where the charges are separated at the positive plate and another at the negative
plate.

Recall that capacitors store energy in the form of separated electric charge. The greater
the area for storing charge and the closer the separated charges, the greater the capacitance.
Aconventional capacitor gets its area from plates of a flat, conductive material. To achieve high
capacitance, this material can be wound in great lengths, and sometimes a texture is imprinted
on it to increase its surface area. A conventional capacitor separates its charged plates with a
dielectric material, sometimes a plastic or paper film, or a ceramic. These dielectrics can be
made only as thin as the available films or applied materials.

An ultracapacitor gets its area from a porous carbon-based electrode material, as shown
in Figure 4.4. The porous structure of this material allows its surface area to approach 2,000
square meters per gram (m’/g), much greater than can be accomplished using flat or tex-
tured films and plates. An ultracapacitor’s charge separation distance is determined by the
size of the ions in the electrolyte, which are attracted to the charged electrode. This charge
separation [less than 10 angstroms (A)] is much smaller than can be achieved using conven-
tional dielectric materials. The combination of enormous surface area and extremely small
charge separation gives the ultracapacitor its outstanding capacitance relative to conventional
capacitors.

Use the data provided to calculate the charge stored in an ultracapacitor, and calculate
how long it will take to discharge the capacitor at the maximum current rate.

Solution

Known Quantities: Technical specifications are as follows:

Capacitance 100 F (—10%/ + 30%)
Series resistance DC 15 mQ(+25%)

1 kHz 7 mQ(+25%)
Voltage Continuous 2.5 V; Peak 2.7 V

Rated current 25A

Find: Charge separation at nominal voltage and time to complete discharge at maximum
current rate.

Analysis: Based on the definition of charge storage in a capacitor, we calculate
Q=CV = 100F x 2.5 V = 250C

To calculate how long it would take to discharge the ultracapacitor, we approximate the defining
differential equation (4.4) as follows:

dq | Aq

dt At

Since we know that the discharge current is 25 A and the available charge separation is 250 F,
we can calculate the time to complete discharge, assuming a constant 25-A discharge:

Comments: We shall continue our exploration of ultracapacitors in Chapter 5. In particular,
we shall look more closely at the charging and discharging behavior of these devices, taking
into consideration their internal resistance.

Assumptions: The capacitor is initially discharged: v(t = 0) = 0.
Analysis: Using the defining differential relationship for the capacitor, we may obtain the

current by differentiating the voltage:

A plot of the capacitor current is shown in Figure 4.6. Note how the current jumps to 0.5 A
instantaneously as the voltage rises exponentially: The ability of a capacitor’s current to change
instantaneously is an important property of capacitors.

Comments: As the voltage approaches the constant value 5 V, the capacitor reaches its
maximum charge storage capability for that voltage (since Q = CV) and no more cur-
rent flows through the capacitor. The total charge stored is Q = 0.5 x 10~° C. This is a
fairly small amount of charge, but it can produce a substantial amount of current for a brief
time. For example, the fully charged capacitor could provide 100 mA of current for a time
equal to 5 jus:

Physical capacitors are rarely constructed of two parallel plates separated by
air, because this configuration yields very low values of capacitance, unless one is
willing to tolerate very large plate areas. To increase the capacitance (i.e., the abil-
ity to store energy), physical capacitors are often made of tightly rolled sheets of
metal film, with a dielectric (paper or Mylar) sandwiched in between. Table 4.1
illustrates typical values, materials, maximum voltage ratings, and useful frequency
ranges for various types of capacitors. The voltage rating is particularly impor-
tant, because any insulator will break down if a sufficiently high voltage is applied
across it.

You may recall that the capacitor was described earlier in this section as an
energy storage element. An expression for the energy stored in the capacitor Wc (t)
may be derived easily if we recall that energy is the integral of power, and that the

The Ideal Inductor

The ideal inductor is an element that has the ability to store energy in a magnetic field.
Inductors are typically made by winding a coil of wire around a core, which can be an
insulator or a ferromagnetic material, as shown in Figure 4.8. When a current flows
through the coil, a magnetic field is established, as you may recall from early physics
experiments with electromagnets. Just as we found an analogy between electric and
fluid circuits for the capacitor, we can describe a phenomenon similar to inductance in
hydraulic circuits, as explained in the sidebar. In an ideal inductor, the resistance of the
wire is zero so that a constant current through the inductor will flow freely without
causing a voltage drop. In other words, the ideal inductor acts as a short circuit
in the presence of DC. If a time-varying voltage is established across the inductor,
a corresponding current will result, according to the following relationship:

di, (t)
dt

vu, (t) =L i-v relation for inductor (4.10)

where L is called the inductance of the coil and is measured in henrys (H), where
1H=1V-s/A (4.11)

Henrys are reasonable units for practical inductors; millihenrys (mH) and micro-
henrys (1H) are also used.

Itis instructive to compare equation 4.10, which defines the behavior of an ideal
inductor, with the expression relating capacitor current and voltage:

4.2 TIME-DEPENDENT SIGNAL SOURCES

In Chapter 2, the general concept of an ideal energy source was introduced. In this
chapter, it will be useful to specifically consider sources that generate time-varying
voltages and currents and, in particular, sinusoidal sources. Figure 4.14 illustrates the
convention that will be employed to denote time-dependent signal sources.

v() if v (0), i(0)

Generalized time-dependent sources Sinusoidal source

Figure 4.14 Time-dependent signal sources

One of the most important classes of time-dependent signals is that of periodic
signals. These signals appear frequently in practical applications and are a useful
approximation of many physical phenomena. A periodic signal x(f) is a signal that
satisfies the equation

x(t) =x(t+nT) n=1,2,3,... (4.19)

where T is the period of x(t). Figure 4.15 illustrates a number of periodic waveforms
that are typically encountered in the study of electric circuits. Waveforms such as the
sine, triangle, square, pulse, and sawtooth waves are provided in the form of volt-
ages (or, less frequently, currents) by commercially available signal (or waveform)
generators. Such instruments allow for selection of the waveform peak amplitude,
and of its period.

As stated in the introduction, sinusoidal waveforms constitute by far the most
important class of time-dependent signals. Figure 4.16 depicts the relevant parameters
of a sinusoidal waveform. A generalized sinusoid is defined as

x(t) = Acos(wt + ¢) (4.20)

where A is the amplitude, w the radian frequency, and ¢ the phase. Figure 4.16
summarizes the definitions of A, w, and ¢ for the waveforms

x1(t) = Acos(a@t) and X2(t) = Acos(wt + ¢)

where

The phase shift @ permits the representation of an arbitrary sinusoidal signal. Thus, the

Why Do We Use
Units of Radians
for the Phase
Angle ¢?

The engineer finds it frequ-
ently more intuitive to refer to
the phase angle in units of
degrees; however, to use
consistent units in the argu-
ment (the quantity in the
parentheses) of the expres-
sion x(t) =A sin(wt + ¢), we
must express @ in units of
radians, since the units of wrt
are [w]-[t] = (rad/s)-s = rad.
Thus, we will consistently
use units of radians for the
phase angle ¢ in all expres-
sions of the form x(t) =

A sin (ot + ¢). To be
consistent is especially
important when one is
performing numerical
calculations; if one used
units of degrees for @ in
calculating the value of

x(t) =A sin(wt + ¢) ata
given t, the answer would
be incorrect.

Chapter 4 AC Network Analysis

one can represent a sine wave in terms of a cosine wave simply by introducing a phase
shift of 2/2 rad:

Asin(wt) = Acos (wt - >) (4.22)

Although one usually employs the variable w (in units of radians per second)
to denote sinusoidal frequency, it is common to refer to natural frequency f in units
of cycles per second, or hertz (Hz). The reader with some training in music theory
knows that a sinusoid represents what in music is called a pure tone; an A-440,
for example, is a tone at a frequency of 440 Hz. It is important to be aware of the
factor of 27 that differentiates radian frequency (in units of radians per second)
from natural frequency (in units of hertz). The distinction between the two units of
frequency—which are otherwise completely equivalent—is whether one chooses to
define frequency in terms of revolutions around a trigonometric circle (in which case
the resulting units are radians per second) or to interpret frequency as a repetition rate
(cycles per second), in which case the units are hertz. The relationship between the
two is the following:

ow = 2nf Radian frequency (4.23)

Why Sinusoids?

By now you should have developed a healthy curiosity about why so much
attention is being devoted to sinusoidal signals. Perhaps the simplest explanation
is that the electric power used for industrial and household applications worldwide
is generated and delivered in the form of either 50- or 60-Hz sinusoidal voltages
and currents. Chapter 7 will provide more details regarding the analysis of elec-
tric power circuits. Note that the methods developed in this section and the subse-
quent sections apply to many engineering systems, not just to electric circuits, and
will be encountered again in the study of dynamic-system modeling and of control
systems.

Now that a number of different signal waveforms have been defined, it is appropriate
to define suitable measurements for quantifying the strength of a time-varying electric
signal. The most common types of measurements are the average (or DC) value of a
signal waveform—which corresponds to just measuring the mean voltage or current
over a period of time—and the root-mean-square (or rms) value, which takes into
account the fluctuations of the signal about its average value. Formally, the operation
of computing the average value of a signal corresponds to integrating the signal
waveform over some (presumably, suitably chosen) period of time. We define the
time-averaged value of a signal x(t) as

1 T
(x(t)) = r / x(t’) dt’ Average value (4,24)
0

where T is the period of integration. Figure 4.17 illustrates how this process does,
in fact, correspond to computing the average amplitude of x(t) over a period of T
seconds.

Chapter 4 AC Network Analysis

The result of Example 4.8 can be generalized to state that
(Acos (wt + ¢)) =0 (4.25)

a result that might be perplexing at first: If any sinusoidal voltage or current has zero
average value, is its average power equal to zero? Clearly, the answer must be no.
Otherwise, it would be impossible to illuminate households and streets and power
industrial machinery with 60-Hz sinusoidal current! There must be another way, then,
of quantifying the strength of an AC signal.

Very conveniently, a useful measure of the voltage of an AC waveform is the
rms value of the signal x(t), defined as follows:

1 T
Xims = 4] 7 / x(t") dt’ Root-mean-square value (4.26)
0

Note immediately that if x(t) is a voltage, the resulting x,,, will also have units of
volts. If you analyze equation 4.26, you can see that, in effect, the rms value consists
of the square root of the average (or mean) of the square of the signal. Thus, the
notation rms indicates exactly the operations performed on x(f) in order to obtain its
rms value.

The definition of rms value does not help explain why one might be interested
in using this quantity. The usefulness of rms values for AC signals in general, and
for AC voltages and current in particular, can be explained easily with reference to
Figure 4.18. In this figure, the same resistor is connected to two different voltage
sources: a DC source and an AC source. We now ask, What is the effective value
of the current from the DC source such that the average power dissipated by the
resistor in the DC circuit is exactly the same as the average power dissipated by the
same resistor in the AC circuit? The direct current /.,; is called the effective value
of the alternating current, which is denoted by i,.(¢). To answer this question, we as-
sume that v,.(t) and therefore i,.(f) are periodic signals with period T. We then use
the definition of average value of a signal given in equation 4.24 to compute the total
energy dissipated by R during one period in the circuit of Figure 4.18(b):

That is,

The rms, or effective, value of the current i,.(t) is the DC that causes the same

average power (or energy) to be dissipated by the resistor.

From here on we shall use the notation V,,,,, OF V, and Tims, OF T, torefer to the effective
(or rms) value of a voltage or current.

waveforms other than sinusoids, as the Check Your Understanding exercises have

4.3 SOLUTION OF CIRCUITS CONTAINING
ENERGY STORAGE ELEMENTS
(DYNAMIC CIRCUITS)

Sections 4.1 and 4.2 introduced energy storage elements and time-dependent signal
sources. The logical next task is to analyze the behavior of circuits containing such
elements. The major difference between the analysis of the resistive circuits studied in
Chapters 2 and 3 and the circuits we explore in the remainder of this chapter is that now
the equations that result from applying Kirchhoff’s laws are differential equations,
as opposed to the algebraic equations obtained in solving resistive circuits. Consider,
for example, the circuit of Figure 4.19, which consists of the series connection of a
voltage source, a resistor, and a capacitor. Applying KCL at the node connecting the
resistor to the capacitor and using the definition of capacitor current in equation 4.4,
we obtain the following equations:

_ d
ig(t) = 3 7 vO _ iMac “ce (4.29)
or
duct) 1 1
Hk + Rove = Ros (4.30)

Equation 4.30 is a first-order, linear, ordinary differential equation in the variable uc.
Alternatively, we could derive an equivalent relationship by applying KVL around
the circuit of Figure 4.19:

—vs(t) + ug(t) + c(t) = 0 (4.31)

Part I Circuits

Observing that ig(t) = ic(t) and using the capacitor equation 4.5, we can write
t

—us(t) + Ric(t) + / ic(t’) dt’ =0 (4.32)

Equation 4.32 is an integral equation, which may be converted to the more familiar
form of a differential equation by differentiating both sides; recalling that

d t
dt | J-x
we obtain the first-order, linear, ordinary differential equation
dic (t) 1, 1 dus(t)
—ic(t) = = 4.34
drt ROOT Rat (43)

Equations 4.30 and 4.34 are very similar; the principal differences are the variable in
the differential equation [vc(t) versus ic(t)] and the right-hand side. Solving either
equation for the unknown variable permits the computation of all voltages and currents
in the circuit.

Note to the Instructor: If so desired, the remainder of this
chapter can be skipped, and the course can continue with
Chapter 5 without any loss of continuity.

Forced Response of Circuits Excited
by Sinusoidal Sources

Consider again the circuit of Figure 4.19, where now the external source produces a
sinusoidal voltage, described by the expression

vs(t) = V cos wt (4.35)

Substituting the expression V cos(wt) in place of the source voltage vs (t) in the differ-
ential equation obtained earlier (equation 4.30), we obtain the following differential
equation:

d 1 1
ht ve + RC Uc = RC V cost (4.36)

Since the forcing function is a sinusoid, the solution may also be assumed to be of
the same form. An expression for uc (ft) is then

uc(t) = Asinwt + Bcosat (4.37)
which is equivalent to

uc(t) = Ccos(t + ) (4.38)
Substituting equation 4.37 in the differential equation for vc(t) and solving for the

coefficients A and B yield the expression

The solution method outlined in the previous paragraphs can become quite
complicated for circuits containing a large number of elements; in particular, one
may need to solve higher-order differential equations if more than one energy storage
element is present in the circuit. A simpler and preferred method for the solution
of AC circuits is presented in Section 4.4. This brief section has provided a simple,
but complete illustration of the key elements of AC circuit analysis. These can be
summarized in the following statement:

In a sinusoidally excited linear circuit, all branch voltages and currents are
sinusoids at the same frequency as the excitation signal. The amplitudes of these
voltages and currents are a scaled version of the excitation amplitude, and the
voltages and currents may be shifted in phase with respect to the excitation
signal.

These observations indicate that three parameters uniquely define a sinusoid:
frequency, amplitude, and phase. But if this is the case, is it necessary to carry the
“excess luggage,” that is, the sinusoidal functions? Might it be possible to simply
keep track of the three parameters just mentioned? Fortunately, the answers to these
two questions are no and yes, respectively. Section 4.4 describes the use of a notation
that, with the aid of complex algebra, eliminates the need for the sinusoidal functions
of time, and for the formulation and solution of differential equations, permitting the
use of simpler algebraic methods.

Part I Circuits

4.4 PHASOR SOLUTION OF CIRCUITS WITH
SINUSOIDAL EXCITATION

In this section, we introduce an efficient notation to make it possible to represent
sinusoidal signals as complex numbers, and to eliminate the need for solving differential
equations. The student who needs a brief review of complex algebra will find a
reasonably complete treatment in Appendix A (available online), including solved
examples and Check Your Understanding exercises. For the remainder of the chapter,
it will be assumed that you are familiar with both the rectangular and the polar forms
of complex number coordinates; with the conversion between these two forms; and
with the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of
complex numbers.

Euler’s Identity

Named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (the last name is pronounced
“Oiler’’), Euler’s identity forms the basis of phasor notation. Simply stated, the identity
defines the complex exponential ¢/° as a point in the complex plane, which may be
represented by real and imaginary components:

e!? =cos@ +jsin0@ (4.44)

Figure 4.21 illustrates how the complex exponential may be visualized as a point
(or vector, if referenced to the origin) in the complex plane. Note immediately that
the magnitude of e/ is equal to 1:

je?|=1 (4.45)
since

|cos@ +jsin@| = Vcos?@ + sin?@ = 1 (4.46)

and note also that writing Euler’s identity corresponds to equating the polar form of a
complex number to its rectangular form. For example, consider a vector of length A
making an angle 6 with the real axis. The following equation illustrates the relationship
between the rectangular and polar forms:

Ae!” = Acos@+jAsind = AZ@ (4.47)

In effect, Euler’s identity is simply a trigonometric relationship in the complex plane.

Phasors

To see how complex numbers can be used to represent sinusoidal signals, rewrite the
expression for a generalized sinusoid in light of Euler’s equation:

Acos(wt + 0) = Re (Ae/"*")) (4.48)
This equality is easily verified by expanding the right-hand side, as follows:
Re (Ae/('+)) = Re [A cos(wt + 0) + jA sin(wt + 6)]
= Acos(wt + 0)

We see, then, that it is possible to express a generalized sinusoid as the real part of
a complex vector whose argument, or angle, is given by wt + @ and whose length,
or magnitude, is equal to the peak amplitude of the sinusoid. The complex phasor

corresponding to the sinusoidal signal A cos(wt + @) is therefore defined to be the
complex number Ae/”:

Ae/® = complex phasor notation for A cos(wt + 6) = AZO (4.49)

It is important to explicitly point out that this is a definition. Phasor notation arises
from equation 4.48; however, this expression is simplified (for convenience, as will
be promptly shown) by removing the “real part of” operator (Re) and factoring out
and deleting the term e/’. Equation 4.50 illustrates the simplification:

Acos(wt + 6) = Re (Ae/@'*) = Re (Ae!*e/“") (4.50)

The reason for this simplification is simply mathematical convenience, as will become
apparent in the following examples; you will have to remember that the e/”’ term that
was removed from the complex form of the sinusoid is really still present, indicating
the specific frequency of the sinusoidal signal w. With these caveats, you should now
be prepared to use the newly found phasor to analyze AC circuits. The following
comments summarize the important points developed thus far in the section. Please
note that the concept of phasor has no real physical significance. It is a convenient
mathematical tool that simplifies the solution of AC circuits.

Lo4) FOCUSON METHODOLOGY

1. Any sinusoidal signal may be mathematically represented in one of two
ways: a time-domain form

v(t) = Acos(wt + @)
and a frequency-domain (or phasor) form

V(jo) = Ae” = AZO
Note the jw in the notation V( jw), indicating the e/®’ dependence of the
phasor. In the remainder of this chapter, bold uppercase quantities indicate
phasor voltages or currents.

2. A phasor is a complex number, expressed in polar form, consisting of a
magnitude equal to the peak amplitude of the sinusoidal signal and a
Phase angle equal to the phase shift of the sinusoidal signal referenced to
a cosine signal.

3. When one is using phasor notation, it is important to note the specific

frequency w of the sinusoidal signal, since this is not explicitly apparent in
the phasor expression.

Convert the phasor voltages from polar to rectangular form:

V, (jw) = 10.61 + 710.61 Vv

V2(ja) = 14.49 + 73.88 Vv
Then

;

Vs (jo) = Vi(jo) + Vo(jo) = 25.10 + j14.49 = 28.98e'7/° = 28.982 —

Now we can convert Vs (ja) to its time-domain form:

vs (t) = 28.98 cos (3771 + 4) Vv

Vv

Comments: Note that we could have obtained the same result by adding the two sinusoids in

the time domain, using trigonometric identities:

but it required a greater amount of computation. In general, phasor analysis greatly simplifies

calculations related to sinusoidal voltages and currents.

It should be apparent by now that phasor notation can be a very efficient tech-
nique to solve AC circuit problems. The following sections continue to develop this
new method to build your confidence in using it.

Superposition of AC Signals

Example 4.10 explored the combined effect of two sinusoidal sources of different
phase and amplitude, but of the same frequency. It is important to realize that the
simple answer obtained there does not apply to the superposition of two (or more)
sinusoidal sources that are not at the same frequency. In this subsection, the case of
two sinusoidal sources oscillating at different frequencies is used to illustrate how
phasor analysis can deal with this, more general case.

The circuit shown in Figure 4.23 depicts a source excited by two current sources
connected in parallel, where

i,(t) = A, cos(a@)f)

in(t) = Az coS(@f) (451)
The load current is equal to the sum of the two source currents; that is,

in(t) = (1) + b(t) (4.52)
or, in phasor form,

IL=h+h (4.53)

At this point, you might be tempted to write I; and I, in a more explicit phasor
form as

I, = Aje/?

4.54
In = Ape?” (454)

and to add the two phasors, using the familiar techniques of complex algebra. How-
ever, this approach would be incorrect. Whenever a sinusoidal signal is expressed
in phasor notation, the term e/® is implicitly present, where w is the actual radian
frequency of the signal. In our example, the two frequencies are not the same, as can
be verified by writing the phasor currents in the form of equation 4.50:

I, = Re (Ajeei")

4.55
Ly = Re (Aree ie") (4.55)

Since phasor notation does not explicitly include the e/' factor, this can lead to
serious errors if you are not careful! The two phasors of equation 4.54 cannot be
added, but must be kept separate; thus, the only unambiguous expression for the load

Part I Circuits 157

current in this case is equation 4.52. To complete the analysis of any circuit with
multiple sinusoidal sources at different frequencies using phasors, it is necessary
to solve the circuit separately for each signal and then add the individual answers
obtained for the different excitation sources. Example 4.11 illustrates the response of
a circuit with two separate AC excitations using AC superposition.

The relationship between Vz and I in the complex plane is shown in Figure 4.28.
Finally, the impedance of the resistor is defined as the ratio of the phasor voltage
across the resistor to the phasor current flowing through it, and the symbol Zp is used
to denote it:

Vo(i
Zr(jo@) = aos =R Impedance of a resistor (4.59)

Equation 4.59 corresponds to Ohm’s law in phasor form, and the result should be
intuitively appealing: Ohm’s law applies to a resistor independent of the particular
form of the voltages and currents (whether AC or DC, for instance). The ratio of phasor
voltage to phasor current has a very simple form in the case of the resistor. In general,
however, the impedance of an element is a complex function of frequency, as it must
be, since it is the ratio of two phasor quantities, which are frequency-dependent. This
property will become apparent when the impedances of the inductor and capacitor
are defined.

The Inductor

Recall the defining relationships for the ideal inductor (equations 4.10 and 4.13),
repeated here for convenience:

diz (t)

; 1

i(t) = ZL / u(t’)
Let vi (t) = vs(t) and i, (t) = i(t) in the circuit of Figure 4.27. Then the following
expression may be derived for the inductor current:

u(t) =L

Chapter 4 AC Network Analysis

Note how a dependence on the radian frequency of the source is clearly present in the
expression for the inductor current. Further, the inductor current is shifted in phase
(by 90°) with respect to the voltage. This fact can be seen by writing the inductor
voltage and current in time-domain form:

vs (t) = uz (t) = Acos wt
) (4.62)

. . A W
i(t) = i(t) = — cos (ot -=

It is evident that the current is not just a scaled version of the source voltage, as it was
for the resistor. Its magnitude depends on the frequency w, and it is shifted (delayed)
in phase by 2/2 rad, or 90°. Using phasor notation, equation 4.62 becomes

Vz(jw) = AZ0
Ijo) = A y ra (4.63)
Jor= ol 2

The relationship between the phasor voltage and current is shown in Figure 4.29.
Thus, the impedance of the inductor is defined as follows:

Vz(jo cA
Z(jw) = os = oLZ> = jol

(4.64)

Note that the inductor now appears to behave as a complex frequency-dependent
resistor, and that the magnitude of this complex resistor wL is proportional to the
signal frequency w. Thus, an inductor will “impede” current flow in proportion to the
sinusoidal frequency of the source signal. This means that at low signal frequencies,
an inductor acts somewhat as a short circuit, while at high frequencies it tends to
behave more as an open circuit.

The Capacitor

An analogous procedure may be followed to derive the equivalent result for a
capacitor. Beginning with the defining relationships for the ideal capacitor
dvc(t)

ic(t) =C
ic(t) ht

; (4.65)
vce) = ral / ic(t’) dt’

with ic = i and vc = vs in Figure 4.27, we can express the capacitor current as

I(jo) = oCAZ >

The relationship between the phasor voltage and current is shown in Figure 4.30. The
impedance of the ideal capacitor Z- (jw) is therefore defined as follows:

Zc( jo) VzGjo) _ | -m

© I(ja) oC 2 Impedance of

where we have used the fact that 1/7 = e~/"/? = —j. Thus, the impedance of a
capacitor is also a frequency-dependent complex quantity, with the impedance of
the capacitor varying as an inverse function of frequency; and so a capacitor acts
as a short circuit at high frequencies, whereas it behaves more as an open circuit at
low frequencies. Figure 4.31 depicts Zc(jq@) in the complex plane, alongside Zr(jw)
and Z; (ja).

The impedance parameter defined in this section is extremely useful in solving
AC circuit analysis problems, because it will make it possible to take advantage of
most of the network theorems developed for DC circuits by replacing resistances with
complex-valued impedances. Examples 4.12 to 4.14 illustrate how branches contain-
ing series and parallel elements may be reduced to a single equivalent impedance,
much in the same way as resistive circuits were reduced to equivalent forms. It is
important to emphasize that although the impedance of simple circuit elements is
either purely real (for resistors) or purely imaginary (for capacitors and inductors),
the general definition of impedance for an arbitrary circuit must allow for the possi-
bility of having both a real and an imaginary part, since practical circuits are made
up of more or less complex interconnections of different circuit elements. In its most
general form, the impedance of a circuit element is defined as the sum of a real part
and an imaginary part

Z(jw) = RUjw) +jX Go) (4.69)

where R is the real part of the impedence, sometimes called the AC resistance
and X is the imaginary part of the impedence, also called the reactance. The fre-
quency dependence of R and X has been indicated explicitly, since it is possible for a
circuit to have a frequency-dependent resistance. Note that the reactances of equations
4.64 and 4.68 have units of ohms, and that inductive reactance is always positive,
while capacitive reactance is always negative. Examples 4.12 to 4.14 illustrate how
a complex impedance containing both real and imaginary parts arises in a circuit.
Impedance is another useful mathematical tool that is convenient in solving AC cir-
cuits, but has no real physical significance. Please note that the impedance Z( ja) is
not a phasor, but just a complex number.

Lo4y EXAMPLE 4.12 Impedance of a Practical Capacitor

Problem
A practical capacitor can be modeled by an ideal capacitor in parallel with a resistor. The
parallel resistance represents leakage losses in the capacitor and is usually quite large. Find
the impedance of a practical capacitor at the radian frequency w = 377 rad/s (60 Hz).
How will the impedance change if the capacitor is used at a much higher frequency, say,
800 kHz?
Solution
Known Quantities: Figure 4.32; C; = 0.001 wF = 1 x 10° F: Rj = 1 MQ.
Find: The equivalent impedance of the parallel circuit Z,.

= 9.3571 x 10°Z(—0.3605) Q

The impedance of the capacitor alone at this frequency would be

Ze1(@ = 377) = -

= 6 m

You can easily see that the parallel impedance Z, is quite different from the impedance of the
capacitor alone, Zc .

If the frequency is increased to 800 kHz, or 1600z x 107 rad/s—a radio frequency in the
AM range—we can recompute the impedance to be

10°
1+ 71,6002 x 103 x 10-9 x 10°

Z,(@ = 16007 x 10°)

The impedance of the capacitor alone at this frequency would be

1 ra
Z = 1,600 x 10°) = = 198.9 Z(-—)Q
ci(@ 7 x10) = Soom x 10" x 10 ( >)

Now, the impedances Z, and Zc, are virtually identical (note that 7/2 = 1.5708 rad). Thus,
the effect of the parallel resistance is negligible at high frequencies.

Comments: The effect of the parallel resistance at the lower frequency (corresponding to
the well-known 60-Hz AC power frequency) is significant: The effective impedance of the
practical capacitor is substantially different from that of the ideal capacitor. On the other

Part I Circuits

hand, at much higher frequency, the parallel resistance has an impedance so much larger
than that of the capacitor that it effectively acts as an open circuit, and there is no difference
between the ideal and practical capacitor impedances. This example suggests that the behavior
of a circuit element depends very much on the frequency of the voltages and currents in the
circuit.

EXAMPLE 4.13 Impedance of a Practical Inductor
Problem

A practical inductor can be modeled by an ideal inductor in series with a resistor. Figure 4.33
shows a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) inductor. The series resistance represents the resistance
of the coil wire and is usually small. Find the range of frequencies over which the impedance
of this practical inductor is largely inductive (i.e., due to the inductance in the circuit). We
shall consider the impedance to be inductive if the impedance of the inductor in the circuit of
Figure 4.34 is at least 10 times as large as that of the resistor.

Solution

Known Quantities: L = 0.098 H; lead length = /, = 2 x 10 cm; n = 250 turns; wire is
30-gauge. Resistance of 30-gauge wire = 0.344 Q/m.

Find: The range of frequencies over which the practical inductor acts nearly as an ideal
inductor.

Analysis: We first determine the equivalent resistance of the wire used in the practical inductor,
using the cross section as an indication of the wire length /,, in the coil:

ly = 250(2 x 0.25 + 2 x 0.5) = 375 cm

7 = total length = /, + J, = 375 + 20 = 395 cm

The total resistance is therefore
R = 0.344 Q/m x 0.395 m = 0.136 Q

Thus, we wish to determine the range of radian frequencies, w, over which the magnitude of
joL is greater than 10 x 0.136 Q:
1.36 1.36

L> 1. — = — =].
oL > 1.36 or o> L 0.098 39 rad/s

Alternatively, the range is f = w/2m > 0.22 Hz.

Comments: Note how the resistance of the coil wire is relatively insignificant. This is true
because the inductor is rather large; wire resistance can become significant for very small
inductance values. At high frequencies, a capacitance should be added to the model because
of the effect of the insulator separating the coil wires.

since the reactance is positive (or, alternatively, the phase angle is positive).

Admittance

In Chapter 3, it was suggested that the solution of certain circuit analysis problems
was handled more easily in terms of conductances than resistances. This is true, for
example, when one is using node analysis, or in circuits with many parallel elements,
since conductances in parallel add as resistors in series do. In AC circuit analysis,
an analogous quantity may be defined—the reciprocal of complex impedance. Just as
the conductance G of a resistive element was defined as the inverse of the resistance,
the admittance of a branch is defined as follows:

Y= 7 S (4.70)

Note immediately that whenever Z is purely real, that is, when Z = R + j0,
the admittance Y is identical to the conductance G. In general, however, Y is the

Part I Circuits

complex number

Y=G+ JB (4.71)
where G is called the AC conductance and B is called the susceptance; the latter
plays a role analogous to that of reactance in the definition of impedance. Clearly, G
and B are related to R and X . However, this relationship is not as simple as an inverse.
Let Z = R+ jX be an arbitrary impedance. Then the corresponding admittance is

Conclusion

In this chapter we have introduced concepts and tools useful in the analysis of AC circuits.
The importance of AC circuit analysis cannot be overemphasized, for a number of reasons.
First, circuits made up of resistors, inductors, and capacitors constitute reasonable models
for more complex devices, such as transformers, electric motors, and electronic amplifiers.
Second, sinusoidal signals are ever-present in the analysis of many physical systems, not
just circuits. The skills developed in Chapter 4 will be called upon in the remainder of the
book. In particular, they form the basis of Chapters 5 and 6. You should have achieved the
following objectives, upon completion of this chapter.

1. Compute currents, voltages, and energy stored in capacitors and inductors. \n addition
to elements that dissipate electric power, there exist electric energy storage elements, the
capacitor and the inductor.

2. Calculate the average and root-mean-square value of an arbitrary (periodic) signal.
Energy storage elements are important whenever the excitation voltages and currents in a
circuit are time-dependent. Average and rms values describe two important properties of
time-dependent signals.

3. Write the differential equation(s) for circuits containing inductors and capacitors.
Circuits excited by time-dependent sources and containing energy storage (dynamic)
circuit elements give rise to differential equations.

4. Convert time-domain sinusoidal voltages and currents to phasor notation, and vice
versa, and represent circuits using impedances. For the special case of sinusoidal
sources, one can use phasor representation to convert sinusoidal voltages and currents
into complex phasors, and use the impedance concept to represent circuit
elements.

TRANSIENT ANALYSIS

he aim of Chapter 5 is to develop a systematic methodology for the solution of
first- and second-order circuits excited by switched DC sources. The chapter
presents a unified approach to determining the transient response of linear
RC, RL, and RLC circuits; and although the methods presented in the chapter
focus only on first- and second-order circuits, the approach to the transient solution
is quite general. Throughout the chapter, practical applications of first- and second-
order circuits are presented, and numerous analogies are introduced to emphasize
the general nature of the solution methods and their applicability to a wide range of
physical systems, including hydraulics, mechanical systems, and thermal systems.

5.1 TRANSIENT ANALYSIS

The graphs of Figure 5.1 illustrate the result of the sudden appearance of a
voltage across a hypothetical load [a DC voltage in Figure 5.1(a), an AC voltage in
Figure 5.1(b)]. In the figure, the source voltage is turned on at time t = 0.2 s. The
voltage waveforms of Figure 5.1 can be subdivided into three regions: a steady-state
region for 0 < ft < 0.2 s; a transient region for 0.2 < t < 2 s (approximately);
and a new steady-state region for tf > 2 s, where the voltage reaches a steady DC
or AC condition. The objective of transient analysis is to describe the behavior of
a voltage or a current during the transition between two distinct steady-state condi-
tions.

Figure 5.1 Examples of transient response

Part I Circuits

The material presented in the remainder of this chapter will provide the tools
necessary to describe the transient response of circuits containing resistors, inductors,
and capacitors. A general example of the type of circuit that is discussed in this section
is shown in Figure 5.2. The switch indicates that we turn the battery power on at time
t = 0. Transient behavior may be expected whenever a source of electrical energy
is switched on or off, whether it be AC or DC. A typical example of the transient
response to a switched DC voltage is what occurs when the ignition circuits in an
automobile are turned on, so that a 12-V battery is suddenly connected to a large
number of electric circuits. The degree of complexity in transient analysis depends
on the number of energy storage elements in the circuit; the analysis can become
quite involved for high-order circuits. In this chapter, we analyze only first- and
second-order circuits, that is, circuits containing one or two energy storage elements,
respectively. In electrical engineering practice, we typically resort to computer-aided
analysis for higher-order circuits.

A convenient starting point in approaching the transient response of electric
circuits is to consider the general model shown in Figure 5.3, where the circuits
in the box consist of a combination of resistors connected to a single energy storage
element, either an inductor or a capacitor. Regardless of how many resistors the circuit
contains, it is a first-order circuit. In general, the response of a first-order circuit to a
switched DC source will appear in one of the two forms shown in Figure 5.4, which
represent, in order, a decaying exponential and a rising exponential waveform. In
the next sections, we will systematically analyze these responses by recognizing that
they are exponential and can be computed very easily once we have the proper form
of the differential equation describing the circuit.

5.2 WRITING DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS FOR
CIRCUITS CONTAINING INDUCTORS AND
CAPACITORS

The major difference between the analysis of the resistive circuits studied in Chapters 2
and 3 and the circuits we explore in the remainder of this chapter is that now the
equations that result from applying Kirchhoff’s laws are differential equations, as
opposed to the algebraic equations obtained in solving resistive circuits. Consider,
for example, the circuit of Figure 5.5, which consists of the series connection of
a voltage source, a resistor, and a capacitor. Applying KVL around the loop, we may
obtain the following equation:

Us (t) — ur(t) — Uc(t) = 0 (5.1)

Capacitance

Just as an electrical capacitor
can store energy and a
hydraulic capacitor can
store fluid (See Make the

Capacitance,” in Chapter 4),
the thermal capacitance C;,
of an object is related to two
physical properties—mass
and specific heat:

C; = mc; m = mass [kg]

c = specific heat
[J/°C-kg]
Physically, thermal
capacitance is related to the
ability of a mass to store heat,
and describes how much the
temperature of the mass will
rise for a given addition of
heat. If we add heat at the
rate q J/s for time At and the
resulting temperature rise is

Observe that in equation 5.4, the independent variable is the series current
flowing in the circuit, and that this is not the only equation that describes the series
RC circuit. If, instead of applying KVL, for example, we had applied KCL at the
node connecting the resistor to the capacitor, we would have obtained the following

form. The solution of either equation is sufficient, however, to determine all voltages
and currents in the circuit. Example 5.1 illustrates the derivation of the differential
equation for another simple circuit containing an energy storage element.

where x(t) represents the capacitor voltage in the circuit of Figure 5.5 and the in-

consist of combinations of circuit element parameters. Equation 5.7 is a first-order
linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The equation is
said to be of first order because the highest derivative present is of first order; it is said
to be ordinary because the derivative that appears in it is an ordinary derivative (in
contrast to a partial derivative); and the coefficients of the differential equation are
constant in that they depend only on the values of resistors, capacitors, or inductors
in the circuit, and not, for example, on time, voltage, or current.

As the number of energy storage elements in a circuit increases, one can there-
fore expect that higher-order differential equations will result. Computer aids are
often employed to solve differential equations of higher order; some of these soft-

5.3 DC STEADY-STATE SOLUTION OF
CIRCUITS CONTAINING INDUCTORS
AND CAPACITORS—INITIAL AND
FINAL CONDITIONS

This section deals with the DC steady-state solution of the differential equations pre-
sented in Section 5.2. In particular, we illustrate simple methods for deriving the initial
and final conditions of circuits that are connected to a switched DC source. These
conditions will be very helpful in obtaining the complete transient solution. Further,
we also show how to compute the initial conditions that are needed to solve the circuit
differential equation, using the principle of continuity of inductor voltage and current.

DC Steady-State Solution

The term DC steady state refers to circuits that have been connected to a DC (voltage
or current) source for a very long time, such that it is reasonable to assume that all
voltages and currents in the circuits have become constant. If all variables are constant,
the steady-state solution of the differential equation can be found very easily, since
all derivatives must be equal to zero. For example, consider the differential equation
derived in Example 5.1 (see Figure 5.6):

diz (t) Riko, Ro

steady-state solution.

Thus, capacitor currents and the inductor voltages become zero in the DC steady state.
From a circuit analysis standpoint, this means that we can very easily apply circuit
analysis methods from Chapters 2 and 3 to determine the steady-state solution of
any circuit containing capacitors and inductors if we observe that the circuit element
for which the current is always zero is the open circuit, and the circuit element for
which the voltage is always zero is the short circuit. Thus we can make the following
observation:

At DC steady state, all capacitors behave as open circuits and all inductors
behave as short circuits.

Prior to presenting some examples, we make one last important comment.
The DC steady-state condition is usually encountered in one of two cases: before
a switch is first activated, in which case we call the DC steady-state solution the
initial condition, and a long time after a switch has been activated, in which case
we call the DC steady-state solution the final condition. We now introduce the no-
tation x(oo) to denote the value of the variable x(t) as tf — oo (final condition)
and the notation x(0) to denote the value of the variable x(t) at t = 0, that is,
just before the switch is activated (initial condition). These ideas are illustrated in
Examples 5.3 and 5.4.

Solution

Known Quantities: The values of the circuit elements are R; = 100 Q; Ry = 75 Q;
R3 = 250 Q; C = 1 uF; Vg = 12 V.

Analysis: After the switch has been closed for a long time, we treat the capacitor as an open
circuit, as shown in Figure 5.9(b). Now the problem is a simple DC circuit analysis problem.
With the capacitor as an open circuit, no current flows through resistor R2, and therefore we
have a simple voltage divider. Let V3 be the voltage across resistor V3; then

R 250
3 _y, — (12) = 8.57V

V3(00) =
3(00) Ri +R; 350

To determine the capacitor voltage, we observe that the voltage across each of the two parallel
branches must be the same, that is, V3(00) = vu. (00) + V2(0o) where V2(0o) is the steady-state
value of the voltage across resistor R,. But V2(oo) is zero, since no current flows through the
resistor, and therefore

Uc (00) = V3(00) = 8.57 V

Comments: The voltage vc (oo) is the final condition of the circuit of Figure 5.9(a).

Continuity of Inductor Currents and Capacitor
Voltages, and Initial Conditions

As has already been stated, the primary variables employed in the analysis of circuits
containing energy storage elements are capacitor voltages and inductor currents. This
choice stems from the fact that the energy storage process in capacitors and induc-
tors is closely related to these respective variables. The amount of charge stored in
a capacitor is directly related to the voltage present across the capacitor, while the
energy stored in an inductor is related to the current flowing through it. A funda-
mental property of inductor currents and capacitor voltages makes it easy to identify
the initial condition and final value for the differential equation describing a cir-
cuit: Capacitor voltages and inductor currents cannot change instantaneously. An
instantaneous change in either of these variables would require an infinite amount of
power. Since power equals energy per unit time, it follows that a truly instantaneous
change in energy (i.e., a finite change in energy in zero time) would require infinite
power.

Another approach to illustrating the same principle is as follows. Consider the
defining equation for the capacitor

dvc(t)
dt

ic(t) =C

Part I Circuits 189

and assume that the capacitor voltage uc(t) can change instantaneously, say, from 0 (1)

to V volts, as shown in Figure 5.11. The value of duc /dt at t = 0 is simply the slope

of the voltage uc(t) at t = 0. Since the slope is infinite at that point, because of the vy
instantaneous transition, it would require an infinite amount of current for the voltage

across a capacitor to change instantaneously. But this is equivalent to requiring an 7=0
infinite amount of power, since power is the product of voltage and current. A similar
argument holds if we assume a “step” change in inductor current from, say, 0 to J
amperes: An infinite voltage would be required to cause an instantaneous change in
inductor current. This simple fact is extremely useful in determining the response of
a circuit. Its immediate consequence is that

Analysis: Att = 0-, since the current source has been connected to the circuit for a very long

the inductor, the voltage across the resistor must be zero. At t = 0*, the switch opens and we
can state that

in(0*) = i, (0) = Is 0

because of the continuity of inductor current.

The analogy between electric
and hydraulic circuits
illustrated in earlier chapters
can be applied to the
hydraulic tank shown in
Figure 5.14. The tank is
cylindrical with cross-
sectional area A, and the
liquid contained in the tank
exits the tank through a valve,
which is modeled by a fluid
resistance R. Initially, the
level, or head, of the liquid is
ho. The principle of
conservation of mass can be
applied to the liquid in the
tank of Figure 5.14 to
determine the rate at which

flow rate out is given by the

5.4 TRANSIENT RESPONSE OF FIRST-ORDER
CIRCUITS

First-order systems occur very frequently in nature: Any system that has the ability
to store energy in one form (potential or kinetic, but not both) and to dissipate this
stored energy is a first-order system. In an electric circuit, we recognize that any
circuit containing a single energy storage element (an inductor or a capacitor) and a
combination of voltage or current sources and resistors is a first-order circuit. We also
encounter first-order systems in other domains. For example, a mechanical system
characterized by mass and damping (e.g., sliding or viscous friction) but that does not
display any elasticity or compliance is a first-order system. A fluid system displaying
flow resistance and fluid mass storage (fluid capacitance) is also first order; an ex-
ample of a first-order hydraulic system is a liquid-filled tank with a valve (variable
orifice). Thermal systems can also often be modeled as having first-order behavior:
The ability to store and to dissipate heat leads to first-order differential equations.
The heating and cooling of many physical objects can often be approximated in this
fashion. The aim of this section is to help you develop a sound methodology for
the solution of first-order circuits, and to help you make the connection with other
domains and disciplines, so that someday you may apply these same ideas to other
engineering systems.

Elements of the Transient Response

As explained in Section 5.1, the transient response of a circuit consists of three parts:
(1) the steady-state response prior to the transient (in this chapter, we shall only
consider transients caused by the switching on or off of a DC excitation); (2) the
transient response, during which the circuit adjusts to the new excitation; and (3)
the steady-state response following the end of the transient. The steps involved in
computing the complete transient response of a first-order circuit excited by a switched
DC source are outlined in the next Focus on Methodology box. You will observe that
we have already explored each of the steps listed below, and that this methodology
is very straightforward, provided that you correctly identify the proper segments of
the response (before, during, and after the transient).

Part I Circuits

FOCUS ONMETHODOLOGY

LO4 ) FIRST-ORDER TRANSIENT RESPONSE

1. Solve for the steady-state response of the circuit before the switch changes
state (t = O-) and after the transient has died out (t — oo). We shall
generally refer to these responses as x(O7) and x(00).

2. Identify the initial condition for the circuit x(0*), using continuity of
capacitor voltages and inductor currents [vc = vc(0-), iz(0T) = iz(07)],
as illustrated in Section 5.3.

3. Write the differential equation of the circuit for t = O*, that is,
immediately after the switch has changed position. The variable x(t) in the
differential equation will be either a capacitor voltage vc(t) or an inductor
current i, (t). It is helpful at this time to reduce the circuit to Thévenin or
Norton equivalent form, with the energy storage element (capacitor or
inductor) treated as the load for the Thévenin (Norton) equivalent circuit.
Reduce this equation to standard form (equation 5.8).

4. Solve for the time constant of the circuit: t = RC for capacitive circuits,
t = L/Rrz for inductive circuits.

5. Write the complete solution for the circuit in the form

x(t) = x(0o) + [x(0) — x(oo) Je"

General Solution of First-Order Circuits

The methodology outlined in the preceding box is illustrated below for the general
form of the first-order system equation (equation 5.8, repeated below for conve-
nience),

where the constants tT = a; /ag and Ks = bo/do are termed the time constant and the
DC gain, respectively. Consider the special case where f (t) is a DC forcing function,
switched on at time ¢ = 0. Let the initial condition of the system be x(t = 0) = x(0).
Then we seek to solve the differential equation

dx(t
T a +x(t) = KsF t>0 (5.25)
As you may recall from an earlier course in differential equations, this solution consists
of two parts: the natural response (or homogeneous solution), with the forcing
function set equal to zero, and the forced response (or particular solution), in

which we consider the response to the forcing function. The complete response then

consists of the sum of the natural and forced responses. Once the form of the complete
response is known, the initial condition can be applied to obtain the final solution.

Natural Response

The natural response is found by setting the excitation equal to zero. Thus, we solve
the equation

7 NO 5 y =0
dt
or (5.26)
dxy(t) X(t)
dt T

Where we use the notation x, (t) to denote the natural response. The solution of this
equation is known to be of exponential form:

xy (t) = aeW"/* Natural response (5.27)

The constant @ in equation 5.27 depends on the initial condition, and can only be
evaluated once the complete response has been determined. If the system does not
have an external forcing function, then the natural response is equal to the complete
response, and the constant @ is equal to the initial condition wa = x(0). The Make the
Connection sidebar “Hydraulic Tank” illustrates this case intuitively by considering
a fluid tank emptying through an orifice. You can see that in the case of the tank, once
the valve (with flow resistance R) is open, the liquid drains at an exponential rate,
starting from the initial liquid level ig, and with a time constant t determined by the
physical properties of the system. You should confirm the fact that if the resistance
of the valve is decreased (i.e., liquid can drain out more easily), the time constant
will become smaller, indicating that the tank will empty more quickly. The concept
of time constant is further explored in Example 5.6.

For the case of interest to us in this chapter, the forced response of the system is the
solution to the equation

in which the forcing function F is equal to a constant for t = 0. For this special
case, the solution can be found very easily, since the derivative term becomes zero in
response to a constant excitation; thus, the forced response is found as follows:

Note that this is exactly the DC steady-state solution described in Section 5.4! We

writing

Analysis:

Step 1: Steady-state response. We first observe that the capacitor had previously been
charged to an initial voltage of 5 V. Thus,

Uc(t) =5 V t<0 and uvc(0-) =5V

When the switch has been closed for a long time, the capacitor current becomes zero (see
equation 5.20); alternatively, we can replace the capacitor by an open circuit. In either case,
the fact that the current in a simple series circuit must become zero after a suitably long time
tells us that

Uc(oo) = Vz = 12 V

Step 2: Initial condition. We can determine the initial condition for the variable vc(t) by
virtue of the continuity of capacitor voltage (equation 5.22):

and transient response, or in the form of natural and forced response. The former is the one
more commonly encountered in circuit analysis (and which is used dominantly in this book);
the latter is the description usually found in mathematical analyses of differential equations.
The complete response described by the above equations is shown graphically in Figure 5.18;
part (a) depicts the steady-state and transient components, while part (b) shows the natural
and forced responses. Of course, the complete response is the same in both

cases.

Comments: Note how in Figure 5.18(a) the steady-state response vcss(t) is simply equal to
the battery voltage, while the transient response vcr (t) rises from —7 to 0 V exponentially. In
Figure 5.18(b), on the other hand, we can see that the energy initially stored in the capacitor
decays to zero via its natural response vcy (t), while the external forcing function causes the
capacitor voltage to rise exponentially to 12 V, as shown in the forced response ucr(t). The
example just completed, though based on a very simple circuit, illustrates all the steps required
to complete the solution of a first-order circuit.

Energy Storage in Capacitors and Inductors

It is appropriate at this time to recall that capacitors and inductors are energy storage
elements. Consider, first, a capacitor, which accumulates charge according to the
relationship Q = CV. The charge accumulated in the capacitor leads to the storage

Part I Circuits

of energy according to the following equation:

1
Wo= rhe ve(t) Energy stored in a capacitor (5.33)

To understand the role of stored energy, consider, as an illustration, the simple circuit
of Figure 5.19, where a capacitor is shown to have been connected to a battery Vz for
along time. The capacitor voltage is therefore equal to the battery voltage: vc (t) = Vz.
The charge stored in the capacitor (and the corresponding energy) can be directly
determined by using equation 5.33. Suppose, next, that at f = 0 the capacitor is
disconnected from the battery and connected to a resistor, as shown by the action
of the switches in Figure 5.19. The resulting circuit would be governed by the RC
differential equation described earlier, subject to the initial condition vc (t = 0) = Vz.
Thus, according to the results of Section 5.4, the capacitor voltage would decay
exponentially according to the following equation:

uc(t) = Vgew/RC (5.34)

Physically, this exponential decay signifies that the energy stored in the capacitor at
t = 0 is dissipated by the resistor at a rate determined by the time constant of the
circuit T = RC. Intuitively, the existence of a closed-circuit path allows for the flow
of a current, thus draining the capacitor of its charge. All the energy initially stored
in the capacitor is eventually dissipated by the resistor.

A very analogous reasoning process explains the behavior of an inductor. Recall
that an inductor stores energy according to the expression

W, = shit (t) Energy stored in an inductor (5.35)

Thus, in an inductor, energy storage is associated with the flow of a current (note the
dual relationship between i, and vc). Consider the circuit of Figure 5.20, which is
similar to that of Figure 5.19 except that the battery has been replaced with a current
source and the capacitor with an inductor. For t < 0, the source current J flows
through the inductor, and energy is thus stored; at t = 0, the inductor current is equal
to Jz. At this point, the current source is disconnected by means of the left-hand
switch, and a resistor is simultaneously connected to the inductor, to form a closed
circuit.! The inductor current will now continue to flow through the resistor, which
dissipates the energy stored in the inductor. By the reasoning in the preceding discus-
sion, the inductor current will decay exponentially:

in(t) = Ipe*/* (5.36)

'Note that in theory an ideal current source cannot be connected in series with a switch. For the purpose
of this hypothetical illustration, imagine that upon opening the right-hand side switch, the current source
is instantaneously connected to another load, not shown.

That is, the inductor current will decay exponentially from its initial condition, with
a time constant t = L/R. Example 5.8 further illustrates the significance of the time
constant in a first-order circuit.

EXAMPLE 5.8 Charging a Camera Flash—Time Constants

Problem

A capacitor is used to store energy in a camera flash light. The camera operates on a 6-V
battery. Determine the time required for the energy stored to reach 90 percent of the maximum.
Compute this time in seconds and as a multiple of the time constant. The equivalent circuit is
shown in Figure 5.21.

Solution

Known Quantities: Battery voltage; capacitor and resistor values.

Find: Time required to reach 90 percent of the total energy storage.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: Vz = 6 V; C = 1,000 wF; R= 1kQ.

Assumptions: Charging starts at f = 0, when the flash switch is turned on. The capacitor is
completely discharged at the start.
Analysis: First, we compute the total energy that can be stored in the capacitor:

Eva = 4Cvz = $CVz = 18 x 103)

Thus, 90 percent of the total energy will be reached when Ey = 0.9 x 18 x 10-7
= 16.2 x 10-3 J. This corresponds to a voltage calculated from

$Cve = 16.2 x 107

2x 16.2% 10>
ye =f AE = 5.002

Next, we determine the time constant of the circuit: t = RC = 10-3 x 10? = 1 s; and we
observe that the capacitor will charge exponentially according to the expression

vc = 6(1 —e/") = 6(1 —e)
Note that the expression for uc (t) is equal to the forced response, since the natural response is

equal to zero (see Example 5.7) when the initial condition in vc (0) = 0. To compute the time
required to reach 90 percent of the energy, we must therefore solve for f in the equation

Vc-90% = 5.692 = 6(1 — e~)

0.949 = 1—e"

0.051 = e*

t = —1n0.051 = 2.975
The result corresponds to a charging time of approximately 3 time constants.
Comments: This example demonstrates the physical connection between the time constant
of a first-order circuit and a practical device. If you wish to practice some of the calculations

related to time constants, you might calculate the number of time constants required to reach
95 and 99 percent of the total energy stored in a capacitor.

An approximate circuit representation of a DC motor consists of a series RL circuit, shown in
Figure 5.22. Apply the first-order circuit solution methodology just described to this approxi-
mate DC motor equivalent circuit to determine the transient current.

be zero; thus,

can be calculated by replacing the inductor with a short circuit:

i,(Co) = R14

Step 2: Initial condition. We can determine the initial condition for the variable i; (t) by
virtue of the continuity of inductor current (equation 5.23):

Step 5: Complete solution. From the Focus on Methodology box, we know that the solution
is of the form

x(t) = x(00) + [x(0) — x(oo)]e"*
Substituting the appropriate variables, we can write

i,(t) = i,(00) + [i,(0) — i(oo)Je*/* t= 0

with

izss(t) = 12.5A Steady-state response

ing (t) = (—12.5)e71/9 5 A Transient response
Alternatively, we can combine the different terms of the response in the following form:

in(t) = 0+ 12.5(1 — e/0) = in (1) + ize (1) t>0
with

inp (t) = 12.5(1 — e7 7/05) A Forced response

The complete response described by the above equations is shown graphically in Figure 5.23.

Comments: Note that in practice it is not a good idea to place a switch in series with an
inductor. As the switch opens, the inductor current is forced to change instantaneously, with

resulting from this inductive kick can damage circuit components.

201

In the preceding examples we have seen how to systematically determine the
solution of first-order circuits. The solution methodology was applied to two simple
cases, but it applies in general to any first-order circuit, providing that one is careful
to identify a Thévenin (or Norton) equivalent circuit, determined with respect to
the energy storage element (i.e., treating the energy storage element as the load).
Thus the equivalent-circuit methodology for resistive circuits presented in Chapter 3
applies to transient circuits as well. Figure 5.24 depicts the general appearance of a
first-order circuit once the resistive part of the circuit has been reduced to Thévenin
equivalent form.

An important comment must be made before we demonstrate the equivalent-
circuit approach to more complex circuit topologies. Since the circuits that are the
subject of the present discussion usually contain a switch, one must be careful
to determine the equivalent circuits before and after the switch changes position.
In other words, it is possible that the equivalent circuit seen by the load before
activating the switch is different from the circuit seen after the switch changes
position.

To illustrate the procedure, consider the RC circuit of Figure 5.25. The objective
is to determine the capacitor voltage for all time. The switch closes att = 0. For t < 0,
we recognize that the capacitor has been connected to the battery V2 through resistor
R». This circuit is already in Thévenin equivalent form, and we know that the capacitor
must have charged to the battery voltage V2, provided that the switch has been closed
for a sufficient time (we shall assume so). Thus,

uc(t) = V2 t<0

(5.37)
Vc(0-) = Vce(0*) = V2
After the switch closes, the circuit on the left-hand side of Figure 5.25 must be
accounted for. Figure 5.26 depicts the new arrangement, in which we have moved the
capacitor to the far right-hand side, in preparation for the evaluation of the equivalent
circuit. Using the Thévenin-to-Norton source transformation technique (introduced
in Chapter 3), we next obtain the circuit at the top of Figure 5.27, which can be easily
reduced by adding the two current sources and computing the equivalent parallel
resistance of R;, R2, and R3. The last step illustrated in the figure is the conversion
to Thévenin form. Figure 5.28 depicts the final appearance of the equivalent circuit
for t > 0.

When the switch has been closed for a long time, the capacitor sees the Thévenin
equivalent circuit computed in Figures 5.27 and 5.28. Thus, when the capacitor is re-
placed with an open circuit, vc(oo) = Vr. Further, we can determine the initial
condition for the variable uc (t) by virtue of the continuity of capacitor voltage (equa-
tion 5.22): vc(OT) = vc(0~) = V2. At t = O the switch closes, and the circuit is
described by the following differential equation, obtained by application of KVL for
the circuit of Figure 5.28:

can write the complete solution

uc(t) = vc(oo) + [vc(0) — ve(ooyle"/* st = 0

uc(t) = Vr + (V2 — Vrye/Rre

The use of Thévenin equivalent circuits to obtain transient responses is emphasized
in the next few examples.

Figure 5.29 Circuit for
Example 5.10

Assumptions: None.

Analysis:

Part 1— 0<t<50ms

Step 1: Steady-state response. We first observe that any charge stored in the capacitor has
had a discharge path through resistors R3 and R2. Thus, the capacitor must be completely
discharged. Hence,

uc(t) =0V t<0 and vc (0-) =0V

To determine the steady-state response, we look at the circuit a long time after the switch has
been closed. At steady state, the capacitor behaves as an open circuit, and we can calculate
the equivalent open circuit (Thévenin) voltage and equivalent resistance to be

Ry
Ri +R
=7.5V

Uc (00) = Vz

Step 2: Initial condition. We can determine the initial condition for the variable vc (t) by
virtue of the continuity of capacitor voltage (equation 5.25):

vc (0) = ve") =0V

Step 3: Writing the differential equation. To write the differential equation, we use the
Thévenin equivalent circuit for t > 0, with Vr = v,(0o), and we write the resulting
differential equation

f@=Vr=75V 0<t<50ms

204

Chapter 5 Transient Analysis

Part 2— t > 50 ms

As mentioned in the problem statement, at t = 50 ms the switch opens again, and the capacitor
now discharges through the series combination of resistors R; and R. Since there is no external
forcing function once the switch is opened, this problem only involves determining the natural
response of the circuit. Recall that the natural response is of the form xy(t) = awe~'/" (see
equation 5.27). We note two important facts:

1. The constant a is the initial condition at the time when the switch is opened, since that
represents the actual value of the voltage across the capacitor from which the exponential
decay will begin.

2. The time constant of the decay is now the time constant of the circuit with the switch
open, that is, T = (Ry + R3)C = 0.0375 s.

To determine a, we must calculate the value of the capacitor voltage at the time when the
switch is opened:

a = Uc(t = 50 ms) = 7.5(1 — e799 /5) = 6.485 V
Thus, we can write the capacitor voltage response for tf > 50 ms as follows:

Ue (t) = 6.485e~ = 0.05)/0.0375

The composite response is plotted below.

EXAMPLE 5.11 Turn-Off Transient of DC Motor ( LO4

Problem

Determine the motor voltage for all time in the simplified electric motor circuit model shown
in Figure 5.30. The motor is represented by the series RL circuit in the shaded box.

Solution

Known Quantities: Battery voltage, resistor, and inductor values.

Find: The voltage across the motor as a function of time. Figure 5.30

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: Rp = 2 Q; Rs = 20 Q; Ry = 0.8 Q;
L=3H; Vz = 100 V.

Assumptions: The switch has been closed for a long time.

Analysis: With the switch closed for a long time, the inductor in the circuit of Figure 5.30
behaves as a short circuit. The current through the motor can then be calculated by the current
divider rule in the modified circuit of Figure 5.31, where the inductor has been replaced with
a short circuit and the Thévenin circuit on the left has been replaced by its Norton equivalent:

1/Rg +1/Ry + 1/Rn Re
1/0.8 100

= = 34.72 A
1/2+1/20+1/0.8 2 Figure 5.31

This current is the initial condition for the inductor current: i, (0) = 34.72 A. Since the motor
inductance is effectively a short circuit, the motor voltage for t < 0 is equal to

in =

Umn(t) = inRm =27.8V 1 <0

When the switch opens and the motor voltage supply is turned off, the motor sees only the shunt
(parallel) resistance Rs, as depicted in Figure 5.32. Remember now that the inductor current

cannot change instantaneously; thus, the motor (inductor) current i,, must continue to flow in the R

Comments: Notice how the motor voltage rapidly changes from the steady-state value of
27.8 V for t < 0 to a large negative value due to the turn-off transient. This inductive kick
is typical of RL circuits, and results from the fact that although the inductor current cannot
change instantaneously, the inductor voltage can and does, as it is proportional to the derivative

EXAMPLE 5.12 Transient Response of Supercapacitors

Problem

An industrial, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is intended to provide continuous power
during unexpected power outages. Ultracapacitors can store a significant amount of energy
and release it during transient power outages to ensure delicate or critical electrical/electronic
systems. Assume that we wish to design a UPS that is required to make up for a temporary
power glitch in a permanent power supply for 5 s. The system that is supported by this UPS
operates at a nominal voltage of 50 V and has a maximum nominal voltage of 60 V, but can
function with a supply voltage as low as 25 V. Design a UPS by determining the suitable
number of series and parallel elements required.

Solution

Known Quantities: Maximum, nominal, and minimum voltage; power rating and time re-
quirements; ultracapacitor data (see Example 4.1).

Find: Number of series and parallel ultracapacitor cells needed to satisfy the specifications.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: Figure 5.34. Capacitance of one cell:
Ccen = 100 F; resistance of one cell: Reen = 15 mQ; nominal cell voltage Vee = 2.5 V. (See
Example 4.1.)

Assumptions: The load can be modeled as a 0.5-Q resistance.

Analysis: The total capacitance of the “stack” required to satisfy the specifications is obtained
by combining capacitors in series and parallel, as illustrated in Figure 5.34(a). Figure 5.34(b)
depicts the electric circuit model of a single cell. First we define some of the important variables
that are to be used in the problem.

The allowable voltage drop in the supply is AV = 25 V, since the load can operate with
a supply as low as 25 V and nominally operates at 50 V.

The time interval over which the voltage will drop (but not below the allowable minimum
of 25 V) is 5s.

The equivalent resistance of the stack consists of n parallel strings of m resistors each;
thus

established the basic parameters, we now apply KCL to the equivalent circuit of Figure 5.34(c)

remains greater than the minimum allowable voltage (25 V) for at least 5 s:

solution could be obtained analytically, by substituting the known values m = 24, Rioaa = 0.5,
Coy = 100 F, Rey = 15 MQ, t = 5 8, and vjoag(t = 5) = 25 V and by solving for the only
unknown, n. We leave this as an exercise. Figure 5.35 plots the transient response of the stack
load system for n = 1 to 5. You can see that for n = 3 the requirement that vioag = 25 V for at

5.5 TRANSIENT RESPONSE OF
SECOND-ORDER CIRCUITS

In many practical applications, understanding the behavior of first- and second-order
systems is often all that is needed to describe the response of a physical system
to external excitation. In this section, we discuss the solution of the second-order
differential equations that characterize RLC circuits.

Deriving the Differential Equations for Second-Order
Circuits

Asimple way of introducing second-order circuits consists of replacing the box labeled
“Circuit containing RL/RC combinations” in Figure 5.3 with a combination of two
energy storage elements, as shown in Figure 5.36. Note that two different cases are
considered, depending on whether the energy storage elements are connected in series
or in parallel.

Consider the parallel case first, which has been redrawn in Figure 5.37 for clarity.
Practice and experience will eventually suggest the best method for writing the circuit
equations. At this point, the most sensible procedure consists of applying the basic
circuit laws to the circuit of Figure 5.37. Start with KVL around the left-hand loop:

ur (t) — Rris(t) — uc(t) = 0 (5.38)
Then apply KCL to the top node, to obtain

is(t) —ic(t) —ir() =0 (5.39)
Further, KVL applied to the right-hand loop yields

uc(t) = uz (t) (5.40)

It should be apparent that we have all the equations we need (in fact, more). Using
the defining relationships for capacitor and inductor, we can express equation 5.39 as

ur (t) — c(t) duc (t)

Cc in(t) = 0 5.41
Ry hh i(t) (5.41)
and equation 5.40 becomes
diz (t)
uc(t) Tt (5.42)

Substituting equation 5.42 in equation 5.41, we can obtain a differential circuit equa-
tion in terms of the variable i; (t):

1 L dir(t) di(t)
t = LC t 5.43
Ry ur (t) Rp dt ie + iz(t) (5.43)
or
din(t)  L diz (t) 1
L ii(t) = 5.44
Cc 7 + Ry dt + it(t) Ry Ur (5.44)

The solution to this differential equation (which depends, as in the case of
first-order circuits, on the initial conditions and on the forcing function) completely
determines the behavior of the circuit. By now, two questions should have appeared
in your mind:

1. Why is the differential equation expressed in terms of i, (t)? [Why not vc (t)?]
2. Why did we not use equation 5.38 in deriving equation 5.44?

Chapter 5 Transient Analysis

In response to the first question, it is instructive to note that, knowing iz(t), we can
certainly derive any one of the voltages and currents in the circuit. For example,

uc(t) = u(t) =L “ (5.45)
; duc (t) d*iz(t)
ic(t) =C =CS = 10 (5.46)

To answer the second question, note that equation 5.44 is not the only form the
differential circuit equation can take. By using equation 5.38 in conjunction with
equation 5.39, one could obtain the following equation:

ur (t) = Relic(t) + in()] + vce (4)

Upon differentiating both sides of the equation and appropriately substituting from
equation 5.41, the following second-order differential equation in vc would be ob-
tained:

Note that the left-hand side of the equation is identical to equation 5.44, except that vc

has been substituted for i,. The right-hand side, however, differs substantially from

equation 5.44, because the forcing function is the derivative of the equivalent voltage.

Since all the desired circuit variables may be obtained either as a function of

iz or as a function of uc, the choice of the preferred differential equation depends

on the specific circuit application, and we conclude that there is no unique method

to arrive at the final equation. As a case in point, consider the two circuits depicted

in Figure 5.38. If the objective of the analysis were to determine the output voltage

Vout, then for the circuit in Figure 5.38(a), one would choose to write the differential

equation in uc, Since Vc = Vout. In the case of Figure 5.38(b), however, the inductor
current would be a better choice, since Vou: = Rriout-

Solution of Second-Order Circuits

Second-order systems also occur very frequently in nature, and are characterized by
the ability of a system to store energy in one of two forms—potential or kinetic—
and to dissipate this stored energy; second-order systems always contain two energy
storage elements. Electric circuits containing two capacitors, two inductors, or one
capacitor and one inductor are usually second-order systems (unless we can combine
the two capacitors or inductors into a single element by virtue of a series or parallel
combination, in which case the system is of first order). Earlier in this chapter we saw
that second-order differential equations can be written in the form of equations 5.12
and 5.13, repeated here for convenience.

sensitivity), respectively. Just as we were able to attach a very precise meaning to
the constants t and Ks in the case of first-order circuits, the choice of constants w,,
¢, and Ks is not arbitrary, but represents some very important characteristics of the
response of second-order systems, and of second-order circuits in particular. As an
illustration, let Ks = 1, w, = 1, and ¢ = 0.2 in the differential equation 5.48, and
let f (t) correspond to a switched input that turns on from zero to unit amplitude? at
t = 0. The response is plotted in Figure 5.39.

We immediately note three important characteristics of the response of
Figure 5.39:

1. The response asymptotically tends to a final value of 1.
2. The response oscillates with a period approximately equal to 6 s.
3. The oscillations decay (and eventually disappear) as time progresses.

Each of these three observations can be explained by one of the three parameters
defined in equation 5.49:

1. The final value of 1 is predicted by the DC gain Ks = 1, which tells us that in
the steady state (when all the derivative terms are zero) x(t) = f(t).

2. The period of oscillation of the response is related to the natural frequency:

@y = | leads to the calculation T = 27 /w, = 27 © 6.28 s. Thus, the natural
frequency parameter describes the natural frequency of oscillation of the
system.

3. Finally, the reduction in amplitude of the oscillations is governed by the
damping ratio ¢. It is not as easy to visualize the effect of the damping ratio
from a single plot, so we have included the plot of Figure 5.40, illustrating how
the same system is affected by changes in the damping ratio. You can see that as
¢ increases, the amplitude of the initial oscillation becomes increasingly smaller
until, when ¢ = 1, the response no longer overshoots the final value of 1 and
has a response that looks, qualitatively, like that of a first-order system.

?This input is more formally called a unit step, and the response deriving from it is called the unit step
response.

In the remainder of this chapter we will study solution methods to determine
the response of second-order circuits.

Elements of the Transient Response

The steps involved in computing the complete transient response of a second-order
circuit excited by a switched DC source are, in essence, the same as the steps we
took in solving a first-order circuit: First we determine the initial and final conditions,
using exactly the same techniques used for first-order circuits (see Section 5.4); then
we compute the transient response. The computation of the transient response of a
second-order circuit, however, cannot be simplified quite as much as was done for
first-order circuits. With a little patience you will find that although it takes a little
longer to go through the computations, the methods are the same as those used in
Section 5.5.

The solution of a second-order differential equation also requires that we
consider the natural response (or homogeneous solution), with the forcing function
set equal to zero, and the forced response (or particular solution), in which we con-
sider the response to the forcing function. The complete response then consists of
the sum of the natural and forced responses. Once the form of the complete response
is known, the initial condition can be applied to obtain the final solution.

Natural Response of a Second-Order System

The natural response is found by setting the excitation equal to zero. Thus, we solve
the equation
1 d?xy(t)  2¢ dxn(t)
wr dt? QO, dt

+ xv (t) = 0 (5.50)
where we use the notation x, (t) to denote the natural response. Just as in the case of
first-order systems, the solution of this equation is known to be of exponential form:

xy (t) = ae” Natural response (5.51)

Substituting this expression into equation 5.50, we obtain the algebraic equation

n On
Equation 5.52 can be equal to zero only if
sv 2¢
=z +—5+1=0 (5.53)

This polynomial in the variable s is called the characteristic polynomial of the
differential equation, and it gives rise to two characteristic roots s; and s>. Thus,
the function x, (t) = we” is a solution of the homogeneous differential equation only
when s = s; and s = 5). The natural response of the system is a linear combination
of the response associated with each characteristic root, that is,

syt Sot

Xn (t) = aye" + aye”? (5.54)

Now, one can solve for the two characteristic roots simply by finding the roots of
equation 5.53:

51.2 = —CO, + sv (26 @y)? — 402 = —CoOn tonVC? — 1

It is immediately apparent that three possible cases exist for the roots of the natural
solution of a second-order differential equation, as shown in this Focus on
Methodology box.

(5.55)

FOCUS ON METHODOLOGY
ROOTS OF SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS

Case 1: Real and distinct roots. This case occurs when ¢ > 1, since the
term under the square root sign is positive in this case, and the roots
are $19 = —C@, + @y,/ 67 — 1. This leads to an overdamped
response.

Case 2: Real and repeated roots. This case holds when ¢ = 1, since the
term under the square root is zero in this case, and

$1.2 = —C@, = —@,. This leads to a critically damped response.

Case 3: Complex conjugate roots. This case holds when ¢ < 1, since the
term under the square root is negative in this case, and
51,2 = —C@y + j@y./1 — C2. This leads to an underdamped

response.

As we shall see in the remainder of this section, identifying the roots of the
second-order differential equation is the key to writing the natural solution. Example
5.13 applies these concepts to an electric circuit.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: R, = 8 kQ; R, = 8kQ; C = 10 uF;
L=1H.

Assumptions: None.

Analysis: To compute the natural response of the circuit, we set the source equal to zero (short
circuit) and observe that the two resistors are in parallel, and can be replaced by a single resistor
R = Rj ||Ro. We apply KCL to the resulting parallel RLC circuit, observing that the capacitor
voltage is the top node voltage in the circuit:

di,
Uc = up = L —

and we substitute the above expression for vc into the first equation to obtain

=> +57 +1=0
d? Rdt ”
This equation is in the form of equation 5.50, with Ks = 1, #2 = 1/LC, and 2¢/a, = L/R.
We can therefore compute the roots of the differential equation from the expression

It is always instructive to calculate the values of the three parameters first. We can see by
inspection that Ks = 1; @, = 1/VLC = 1/V10-5 = 316.2 rad/s; and ¢ = Lw,/2R = 0.04.
Since ¢ < 1, the response is underdamped, and the roots will be of the form s;. = —fa,
+ j@,./1 — ¢?. Substituting numerical values, we have s;. = —12.5 + j316.2, and we can
write the natural response of the circuit as

Xy (t) = ore! Seon jo s )e + ane! Seon— Jo s )e

The constants a, and a can be determined only once the forced response and the initial
conditions have been determined. We shall see more complete examples very shortly.

Comments: Note that once the second-order differential equation is expressed in general
form (equation 5.50) and the values of the three parameters are identified, the task of writing
the natural solution with the aid of the Focus on Methodology box, “Roots of Second-Order
Systems,” is actually very simple.

Note that the second term is multiplied by ¢; thus a critically damped system consists
of the sum of a first-order exponential term plus a similar term multiplied by rt. The
appearance is that of the sum of two first-order systems, as shown in Figure 5.44.

3. UNDERDAMPED SOLUTION

Complex conjugate roots. This case holds when ¢ < 1, since the term under the
square root sign is negative, and 51. = —C@, + j@y./1—¢?. This leads to an
underdamped response. The general form of the response is

(retin TE) 4 gel tori /I-E) (5.58)

To better understand this solution, and the significance of the complex exponential,
let us assume that aj = a2 = a. Then we can further manipulate equation 5.58 to
obtain

Xy(t) = ae Son! (cov) 4 ellen =)
= Agen! cog (on =?) 1

The last step in equation 5.59 made use of Euler’s equation (equation 4.44), and clearly
illustrates the appearance of the underdamped response of a second-order system: The
response oscillates at a frequency wy, called the damped natural frequency, where
@q = nV 1— ¢2. This frequency asymptotically approaches the natural frequency
as ¢ tends to zero. The oscillation is damped by the exponential decay term 2ae7 5".
The time constant for the exponential decay is tT = 1/€@,, so you can see that as ¢
becomes larger (more damping), tT becomes smaller and the oscillations decay more
quickly. The two factors that make up the response are plotted in Figure 5.45, along
with their product, which is the natural response.

xy (t) = aye

(5.59)

Forced Response
For the case of interest to us in this chapter, that is, switched DC sources, the forced
response of the system is the solution to the equation
1 d*x(t)  2¢ dx(t)
t) = Ksf(t 5.60
eae to, a PO =KSO (5.60)

in which the forcing function f(t) is equal to a constant F for t > 0. For this special
case, the solution can be found very easily, since the derivative term becomes zero in
response to a constant excitation; thus, the forced response is found as follows:

Xp(t) = KsF t>0 Forced response (5.61)

Note that this is again exactly the DC steady-state solution described in
Section 5.4! We already know how to find the forced response of any RLC cir-
cuit when the excitation is a switched DC source. Further, we recognize that the two
solutions are identical by writing

Xp(t) = x(0o) = KsF t>0 (5.62)

Complete Response

The complete response can now be calculated as the sum of the two responses,
and it depends on which of the three cases—overdamped, critically damped, or
underdamped—applies to the specific differential equation.

In each of these cases, to solve for the unknown constants a; and a2, we apply the
initial conditions. Since the differential equation is of the second order, two initial
conditions will be required: x(f = 0) = x(0) and dx(t = 0)/dt = x(0). The details of
the procedure vary slightly in each of the three cases, so it is best to present each case
by way of a complete example. The complete procedure is summarized in the Focus

Find: The complete response of the differential equation in i,(t) describing the circuit of
Figure 5.48.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: V; = 25 V; R=5kQ; C = 1 pF;
L=1H.

Assumptions: The capacitor has been charged (through a separate circuit, not shown) prior
to the switch closing, such that vc(0) = 5 V.

Analysis:

Step 1: Steady-state response. Before the switch closes, the current in the circuit must

be zero. We are therefore sure that the inductor current is initially zero: i,(0~) = 0. We
cannot know, in general, what the state of charge of the capacitor is. The problem statement
tells us that vc(O~) = 5 V. This fact will be useful later, when we determine the initial
conditions.

After the switch has been closed for a long time and all the transients have died, the
capacitor becomes an open circuit, and the inductor behaves as a short circuit. Since the open
circuit prevents any current flow, the voltage across the resistor will be zero. Similarly, the
inductor voltage is zero, and therefore the source voltage will appear across the capacitor.
Hence, i,(0o) = 0 and uc (co) = 25 V.

Step 2: Initial conditions. Recall that for a second-order circuit, we need to determine two
initial conditions; and recall that, from continuity of inductor voltage and capacitor currents,
we know that i,(0~) = i,(0*) = 0 and vc(0~) = vc (0) = 5 V. Since the differential
equation is in the variable iz, the two initial conditions we need to determine are i, (0*)

and di, (0*)/dt. These can actually be found rather easily by applying KVL at t = 07:

Chapter 5 Transient Analysis

Assumptions: None.
Analysis:

Step 1: Steady-state response. With the switch open for a long time, any energy stored in
the capacitor and inductor has had time to be dissipated by the resistor; thus, the currents and
voltages in the circuit are zero: i,(0~) = 0, vc(O-) = v(0-) = 0.

After the switch has been closed for a long time and all the transients have died, the
capacitor becomes an open circuit, and the inductor behaves as a short circuit. With the
inductor behaving as a short circuit, all the source current will flow through the inductor, and
i,(0o) = Is = 5 A. On the other hand, the current through the resistor is zero, and therefore
Uc (co) = v(oco) = OV.

Step 2: Initial conditions. Recall that for a second-order circuit we need to determine two
initial conditions; and recall that, from continuity of inductor voltage and capacitor currents,
we know that i, (0~) = i,(0*) = 0 Aand vc (0-) = vc (0) = 0 V. Since the differential
equation is in the variable uc, the two initial conditions we need to determine are vc(0*) and
duc (0*)/dt. These can actually be found rather easily by applying KCL at t = 0°:

Since vc (0+) = 0 and i, (0T) = 0, we can easily determine duc (0*) /dt:

Note that the right-hand side (forcing function) of this differential equation is exactly zero.

Step 4: Solve for w, and ¢. If we now compare the second-order differential equations to the

Thus, the second-order circuit is critically damped.

Step 5: Write the complete solution. Knowing that the circuit is critically damped (¢ = 1),
we write the complete solution for this case:

x(t) = xy (t) + x(t) = aye FO" + ante 5°"! + x(00) t>0
and, since vcr = Uc (co) = 0, the complete solution is identical to the homogeneous solution:
vc(t) = Ven (t) = e782" + argte FO" t>0

Step 6: Solve for the constants a; and «2. Finally, we solve for the initial conditions to
evaluate the constants a; and a. The first initial condition yields

vc (Ot) = aje® +a, -0-e° =0

Determine the complete response of the circuit shown in Figure 5.52 by solving the differential
equation for the current i;(t).

- Known Quantities: Circuit elements.

Figure 5.52 Circuit for Find: The complete response of the differential equation in i,(t) describing the circuit of
Example 5.16 Figure 5.52.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: Vs; = 12 V; R = 200 Q; C = 10 uF;
L=0.5 H.

Assumptions: The capacitor had been previously charged (through a separate circuit, not
shown), such that vc(0~) = vc(0T) = 2 V.

Analysis:

Step 1: Steady-state response. Since the inductor current is zero when the switch is open,
i,(O~) = 0; on the other hand, we have assumed that vc(0~) = v(0~) = 2 V. After the switch
has been closed for a long time and all the transients have died, the capacitor becomes an
open circuit, and the inductor behaves as a short circuit. With the capacitor behaving as an
open circuit, all the source voltage will appear across the capacitor, and, of course, the
inductor current is zero: i,(00) = 0 A, vc (co) = Vs = 12 V.

Step 2: Initial conditions. Recall that for a second-order circuit we need to determine two
initial conditions; and recall that, from continuity of inductor voltage and capacitor currents,
we know that i,(0~) = i,(0*) = 0 A and vc (0~) = vc(0*) = 2 V. Since the differential
equation is in the variable i,, the two initial conditions we need to determine are i,(0*) and
di, (0+) /dt. The second initial condition can be found by applying KVL at t = 0°:

Note that the right-hand side (forcing function) of this differential equation is exactly zero,

Thus, the second-order circuit is underdamped.

write the complete solution for this case as

EXAMPLE 5.17 Transient Response of Automotive Ignition
Circuit LO5

Problem

The circuit shown in Figure 5.54 is a simplified but realistic representation of an automotive FIND IT
ignition system. The circuit includes an automotive battery, a transformer® (ignition coil),
a capacitor (known as condenser in old-fashioned automotive parlance), and a switch. The
switch is usually an electronic switch (e.g., a transistor—see Chapter 10) and can be treated
as an ideal switch. The circuit on the left represents the ignition circuit immediately after the
electronic switch has closed, following a spark discharge. Thus, one can assume that no energy
is stored in the inductor prior to the switch closing, say at f = 0. Furthermore, no energy is
stored in the capacitor, as the short circuit (closed switch) across it would have dissipated any
charge in the capacitor. The primary winding of the ignition coil (left-hand side inductor) is
then given a suitable length of time to build up stored energy, and then the switch opens, say at
t = At, leading to a rapid voltage buildup across the secondary winding of the coil (right-hand
side inductor). The voltage rises to a very high value because of two effects: the inductive
voltage kick described in Example 5.11 and the voltage multiplying effect of the transformer.
The result is a very short high-voltage transient (reaching thousands of volts), which causes a
spark to be generated across the spark plug.

Analysis: Assume that initially no energy is stored in either the inductor or the capacitor,
and that the switch is closed, as shown in Figure 5.55(a). When the switch is closed, a first-
order circuit is formed by the primary coil inductance and capacitance. The solution of this
circuit will now give us the initial condition that will be in effect when the switch is ready
to open again. This circuit is identical to that analyzed in Example 5.9, and we can directly
borrow the solution obtained from that example, after suitably replacing the final value and time
constant:

in(t) = i,(00) + [i,(0) — iz(co) Je” t>0
i,(t) = 6(1 — e-/25x107) eS 0

T= =2.5x 10s Time constant

DP
Let the switch remain closed until f = At = 12.5 ms = 5r. At time At, the value of the
inductor current will be

in(t = At) = 6(1 —e) =5.96A

that is, the current reaches 99 percent of its final value in five time constants.

Now, when the switch opens at t = At, we are faced with a series RLC circuit similar to
that of Example 5.16, except for the fact that the initial condition that is nonzero is the inductor
current (in Example 5.16 you will recall that the capacitor had a nonzero initial condition). We
can therefore borrow the solution to Example 5.16, with some slight modifications because of
the difference in initial conditions, as shown below. Please note that even though the second-
order circuit transient starts at t = 12.5 ms, we have “reset” the time to tf = 0 for simplicity in
writing the solution. You should be aware that the solution below actually starts at t = 12.5 ms.

Step 1: Steady-state response. At t = Af, i,(0~) = 6A; uc(0-) = v(0-) = 0 V. After the
switch has been closed for a long time and all the transients have died, the capacitor becomes
an open circuit, and the inductor behaves as a short circuit. With the capacitor behaving as an
open circuit, all the source voltage will appear across the capacitor, and, of course, the
inductor current is zero: i,(00) = 0 A, vc (co) = Vs = 12 V.

Step 2: Initial conditions. Since the differential equation is in the variable i,, the two initial
conditions we need to determine are i,(0*) and di,(0*)/dt. Now i,(0~) = i,(0*) = 5.96 A.
The second initial condition can be found by applying KVL at t = 0*

To compute the primary voltage, we simply differentiate the inductor current and
multiply by L; to determine the secondary voltage, which is that applied to the spark plug, we
simply remark that a 1:100 transformer increases the voltage by a factor of 100, so that the
secondary voltage is 100 times larger than the primary voltage.* Thus, the expression for the
secondary voltage is

where we have “reset” time to t = 0 for simplicity. We are actually interested in the value of
this voltage at tf = 0, since this is what will generate the spark; evaluating the above
expression at tf = 0, we obtain

Uspark plug(t = 0) = 0.5 x (5.96(—200)) + 0.5 x (0.8 x 4,463) = 1,189.2 V

“The secondary current, on the other hand, will decrease by a factor of 100, so that power is
conserved—see Section 7.3.

Part I Circuits

One can clearly see that the result of the switching is a very large (negative) voltage
spike, capable of generating a spark across the plug gap. A plot of the inductor voltage
starting at the time when the switch is opened is shown in Figure 5.57, showing that
approximately 0.3 ms after the switching transient, the secondary voltage reaches
approximately —12,500 V! This value is rather typical of the voltages required to generate a
spark across an automotive plug.

Conclusion

Chapter 5 has focused on the solution of first- and second-order differential equations for the
case of DC switched transients, and it has presented a number of analogies between electric
circuits and other physical systems, such as thermal, hydraulic, and mechanical.

While many other forms of excitation exist, turning a DC supply on and off is a very
common occurrence in electrical, electronic, and electromechanical systems. Further, the
methods discussed in this chapter can be readily extended to the solution of more general
problems.

Upon completing this chapter, you should have mastered the following learning
objectives:

1. Write differential equations for circuits containing inductors and capacitors. You have
seen that writing the differential equations of dynamic circuits involves two concepts:
applying Kirchhoff’s laws and using the constitutive differential or integral relationships
for inductors and capacitors. Often, it is convenient to isolate the purely resistive part of
a circuit and reduce it to an equivalent circuit.

2. Determine the DC steady-state solution of circuits containing inductors and capacitors.
You have learned that the DC steady-state solution of any differential equation can be
easily obtained by setting the derivative terms equal to zero. An alternate method for
computing the DC steady-state solution is to recognize that under DC steady-state
conditions, inductors behave as short circuits and capacitors as open circuits.

3. Write the differential equation of first-order circuits in standard form, and determine the
complete solution of first-order circuits excited by switched DC sources. First-order
systems are most commonly described by way of two constants: the DC gain and the
time constant. You have learned how to recognize these constants, how to compute the
initial and final conditions, and how to write the complete solution of all first-order
circuits almost by inspection.

232 Chapter 5 Transient Analysis

4. Write the differential equation of second-order circuits in standard form, and determine
the complete solution of second-order circuits excited by switched DC sources.
Second-order circuits are described by three constants: the DC gain, the natural
frequency, and the damping ratio. While the method for obtaining the complete solution
for a second-order circuit is logically the same as that used for a first-order circuit, some
of the details are a little more involved in the second-order case.

5. Understand analogies between electric circuits and hydraulic, thermal, and mechanical
systems. Many physical systems in nature exhibit the same first- and second-order
characteristics as the electric circuits you have studied in this chapter. We have taken a

look at some thermal, hydraulic, and mechanical analogies.

FREQUENCY RESPONSE
AND SYSTEM CONCEPTS

hapter 4 introduced the notions of energy storage elements and dynamic circuit

equations and developed appropriate tools (complex algebra and phasors) for

the solution of AC circuits. In Chapter 5, we explored the solution of first- and

second-order circuits subject to switching transients. The aim of this present
chapter is to exploit AC circuit analysis methods to study the frequency response of
electric circuits.

It is common, in engineering problems, to encounter phenomena that are
frequency-dependent. For example, structures vibrate at a characteristic frequency
when excited by wind forces (some high-rise buildings experience perceptible
oscillation!). The propeller on a ship excites the shaft at a vibration frequency related
to the engine’s speed of rotation and to the number of blades on the propeller. An
internal combustion engine is excited periodically by the combustion events in the
individual cylinder, at a frequency determined by the firing of the cylinders. Wind
blowing across a pipe excites a resonant vibration that is perceived as sound (wind
instruments operate on this principle). Electric circuits are no different from other
dynamic systems in this respect, and a large body of knowledge has been developed
for understanding the frequency response of electric circuits, mostly based on the
ideas behind phasors and impedance. These ideas, and the concept of filtering, will
be explored in this chapter.

243

244

Chapter 6 Frequency Response and System Concepts

The ideas developed in this chapter will also be applied, by analogy, to the anal-
ysis of other physical systems (e.g., mechanical systems), to illustrate the generality
of the concepts.

> Learning Objectives

1. Understand the physical significance of frequency domain analysis, and compute the
frequency response of circuits using AC circuit analysis tools. Section 6.1.

2. Analyze simple first- and second-order electrical filters, and determine their fre-
quency response and filtering properties. Section 6.2.

3. Compute the frequency response of a circuit and its graphical representation in the
form of a Bode plot. Section 6.3.

6.1 SINUSOIDAL FREQUENCY RESPONSE

The sinusoidal frequency response (or, simply, frequency response) of a circuit pro-
vides a measure of how the circuit responds to sinusoidal inputs of arbitrary frequency.
In other words, given the input signal amplitude, phase, and frequency, knowledge
of the frequency response of a circuit permits the computation of the output signal.
Suppose, for example, that you wanted to determine how the load voltage or current
varied in response to different excitation signal frequencies in the circuit of Figure 6.1.
An analogy could be made, for example, with how a speaker (the load) responds to
the audio signal generated by a CD player (the source) when an amplifier (the circuit)
is placed between the two.! In the circuit of Figure 6.1, the signal source circuitry is
represented by its Thévenin equivalent. Recall that the impedance Zs presented by
the source to the remainder of the circuit is a function of the frequency of the source
signal (Section 4.4). For the purpose of illustration, the amplifier circuit is represented
by the idealized connection of two impedances Z, and Z), and the load is represented
by an additional impedance Z,. What, then, is the frequency response of this circuit?
The following is a fairly general definition:

The frequency response of a circuit is a measure of the variation of a load-related
voltage or current as a function of the frequency of the excitation signal.

According to this definition, frequency response could be defined in a variety of ways.
For example, we might be interested in determining how the load voltage varies as
a function of the source voltage. Then analysis of the circuit of Figure 6.1 might
proceed as follows.

'Tn reality, the circuitry in a high-fidelity stereo system is far more complex than the circuits discussed in
this chapter and in the homework problems. However, from the standpoint of intuition and everyday
experience, the audio analogy provides a useful example; it allows you to build a quick feeling for the
idea of frequency response. Practically everyone has an intuitive idea of bass, midrange, and treble as
coarsely defined frequency regions in the audio spectrum. The material presented in the next few
sections should give you a more rigorous understanding of these concepts.

One method that allows for representation of the load voltage as a function of the
source voltage (this is, in effect, what the frequency response of a circuit implies)
is to describe the source and attached circuit by means of the Thévenin equivalent
circuit. (This is not the only useful technique; the node voltage or mesh current
equations for the circuit could also be employed.) Figure 6.2 depicts the original
circuit of Figure 6.1 with the load removed, ready for the computation of the Thévenin
equivalent.

voltage divider, as illustrated in Figure 6.3 and by the following equation:

Thus, the frequency response of the circuit, as defined in equation 6.1, is given by the
expression
ZZy

Vi
Vir iy — Helio) = 6.3
Vs; (jo) v (jo) Zi (Zs + Z, + Z) + (Zs + ZL .

The expression for Hy(jq@) is therefore known if the impedances of the circuit ele-
ments are known. Note that Hy (jw) is a complex quantity (dimensionless, because it
is the ratio of two voltages) and that it therefore follows that

V_(jo) is a phase-shifted and amplitude-scaled version of Vs (ja).

If the phasor source voltage and the frequency response of the circuit are known, the
phasor load voltage can be computed as follows:

Vi(j@) = Hy (jo) - Vs (jo) (6.4)
Viel = |Hy|e/<™ - Vsels (6.5)
or
Viel = |Hy |Vsel(ZHe+6s) (6.6)
where
Vi = |Ay|- Vs
and (6.7)
gi = ZH, + $s

Thus, the effect of inserting a linear circuit between a source and a load is best
understood by considering that, at any given frequency , the load voltage is a sinusoid
at the same frequency as the source voltage, with amplitude given by Vz = |Hy|- Vs
and phase equal to ¢, = ZH, + ds, where |Hy| is the magnitude of the fre-
quency response and ZH, is its phase angle. Both |Hy| and ZH, are functions of
frequency.

Analysis: To solve this problem, we use an equivalent circuit approach. Recognizing that R,
is the load resistance, we determine the equivalent circuit representation of the circuit to the
left of the load, using the techniques perfected in Chapters 3 and 4. The Thévenin equivalent
circuit is shown in Figure 6.5. Using the voltage divider rule and the equivalent circuit shown
in the figure, we obtain the following expressions:

Comments: The use of equivalent circuit ideas is often helpful in deriving frequency response
functions, because it naturally forces us to identify source and load quantities. However, it is
certainly not the only method of solution. For example, node analysis would have yielded the
same results just as easily, by recognizing that the top node voltage is equal to the load voltage
and by solving directly for V; as a function of Vs, without going through the intermediate step

6.2 FILTERS

There are many practical applications that involve filters of one kind or another. Just to
mention two, filtration systems are used to eliminate impurities from drinking water,
and sunglasses are used to filter out eye-damaging ultraviolet radiation and to reduce
the intensity of sunlight reaching the eyes. An analogous concept applies to electric
circuits: it is possible to attenuate (i.e., reduce in amplitude) or altogether eliminate
signals of unwanted frequencies, such as those that may be caused by electrical
noise or other forms of interference. This section will be devoted to the analysis of
electrical filters.

Low-Pass Filters

Figure 6.7 depicts a simple RC filter and denotes its input and output voltages,

respectively, by V; and V,. The frequency response for the filter may be obtained by

considering the function
; Vo.

A (jo) = vy, (i) (6.11)

and noting that the output voltage may be expressed as a function of the input voltage
by means of a voltage divider, as follows:

; _.  1/joC ; 1
(jo) (jo) 5 + VjoC (jo) 5 + joRC (6.12)
Thus, the frequency response of the RC filter is

RC low-pass filter. The circuit
preserves lower frequencies while
attenuating the frequencies above
the cutoff frequency @p = 1/RC.
The voltages V; and V, are the
filter input and output voltages,
respectively.

Figure 6.7 A simple RC
filter

Chapter 6 Frequency Response and System Concepts

An immediate observation upon studying this frequency response, is that if the
signal frequency w is zero, the value of the frequency response function is 1. That
is, the filter is passing all the input. Why? To answer this question, we note that at
@ = 0, the impedance of the capacitor, 1/jwC, becomes infinite. Thus, the capacitor
acts as an open circuit, and the output voltage equals the input:

V.(jo = 0) = Vi(jo = 0) (6.14)

Since a signal at sinusoidal frequency equal to zero is a DC signal, this filter circuit
does notin any way affect DC voltages and currents. As the signal frequency increases,
the magnitude of the frequency response decreases, since the denominator increases
with w. More precisely, equations 6.15 to 6.18 describe the magnitude and phase of
the frequency response of the RC filter:

The simplest way to envision the effect of the filter is to think of the phasor voltage
V; = V;e/% scaled by a factor of |H | and shifted by a phase angle 7H by the filter at
each frequency, so that the resultant output is given by the phasor V,e/®, with

and where |H| and 7H are functions of frequency. The frequency a is called the
cutoff frequency of the filter and, as will presently be shown, gives an indication of
the filtering characteristics of the circuit.

It is customary to represent H (jw) in two separate plots, representing |H| and
ZH as functions of w. These are shown in Figure 6.8 in normalized form, that is, with
|H| and 7H plotted versus w/w , corresponding to a cutoff frequency wo = | rad/s.
Note that, in the plot, the frequency axis has been scaled logarithmically. This is a
common practice in electrical engineering, because it enables viewing a very broad
range of frequencies on the same plot without excessively compressing the low-
frequency end of the plot. The frequency response plots of Figure 6.8 are commonly

(6.20)

Part I Circuits

employed to describe the frequency response of a circuit, since they can provide a
clear idea at a glance of the effect of a filter on an excitation signal. For example,
the RC filter of Figure 6.7 has the property of “passing” signals at low frequencies
(w <« 1/RC) and of filtering out signals at high frequencies (w >> 1/RC). This
type of filter is called a low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency w = 1/RC has a
special significance in that it represents—approximately—the point where the filter
begins to filter out the higher-frequency signals. The value of |H (jw)| at the cutoff
frequency is 1/./2 = 0.707. Note how the cutoff frequency depends exclusively on
the values of R and C. Therefore, one can adjust the filter response as desired simply
by selecting appropriate values for C and R, and therefore one can choose the desired
filtering characteristics.

Chapter 6 Frequency Response and System Concepts

Assumptions: None.

Analysis: In this problem, we know the input signal voltage and the frequency response of
the circuit (equation 6.15), and we need to find the output voltage at two different frequencies.
If we represent the voltages in phasor form, we can use the frequency response to calculate the
desired quantities:

write the expression for the frequency response in the form of equations 6.17 and 6.18:

And finally, we write the time-domain response for each frequency:

Uo(t) = 0.169 cos(2z 10,000 — 1.537) V at @ = 27 10,000 rad/s

The magnitude and phase responses of the filter are plotted in Figure 6.9. It should be evident
from these plots that only the low-frequency components of the signal are passed by the filter.
This low-pass filter would pass only the bass range of the audio spectrum.

Comments: Can you think of a very quick, approximate way of obtaining the answer to this
problem from the magnitude and phase plots of Figure 6.9? Try to multiply the input voltage
amplitude by the magnitude response at each frequency, and determine the phase shift at each
frequency. Your answer should be pretty close to the one computed analytically.

is indeed close to 0.1. The phase response is shown in Figure 6.12(b).

Much more complex low-pass filters than the simple RC combinations shown
so far can be designed by using appropriate combinations of various circuit elements.
The synthesis of such advanced filter networks is beyond the scope of this book;
however, we discuss the practical implementation of some commonly used filters in
Chapter 8, in connection with the discussion of the operational amplifier. The next
two sections extend the basic ideas introduced in the preceding pages to high-pass
and bandpass filters, that is, to filters that emphasize the higher frequencies or a band
of frequencies, respectively.

High-Pass Filters

Just as you can construct a simple filter that preserves low frequencies and attenuates
higher frequencies, you can easily construct a high-pass filter that passes mainly those
frequencies above a certain cutoff frequency. The analysis of a simple high-pass filter
can be conducted by analogy with the preceding discussion of the low-pass filter. Con-
sider the circuit shown in Figure 6.13. The frequency response for the high-pass filter

You can verify by inspection that the amplitude response of the high-pass filter will

Bandpass Filters, Resonance, and Quality Factor

Building on the principles developed in the preceding sections, we can also con-
struct a circuit that acts as a bandpass filter, passing mainly those frequencies
within a certain frequency range. The analysis of a simple second-order bandpass
filter (i.e., a filter with two energy storage elements) can be conducted by analogy
with the preceding discussions of the low-pass and high-pass filters. Consider the

Equation 6.26 can often be factored into the form
Vo... jAw
(jo) = — — (6.27)
Vi (jo/@ + I)(Go/o2 + 1)

where w and q are the two frequencies that determine the passband (or bandwidth)
of the filter—that is, the frequency range over which the filter “passes” the input
signal—and A is a constant that results from the factoring. An immediate observation
we can make is that if the signal frequency w is zero, the response of the filter is
equal to zero, since at w = 0 the impedance of the capacitor 1/j@C becomes infinite.
Thus, the capacitor acts as an open circuit, and the output voltage equals zero. Further,
we note that the filter output in response to an input signal at sinusoidal frequency
approaching infinity is again equal to zero. This result can be verified by considering
that as w approaches infinity, the impedance of the inductor becomes infinite, that is,
an open circuit. Thus, the filter cannot pass signals at very high frequencies. In an
intermediate band of frequencies, the bandpass filter circuit will provide a variable
attenuation of the input signal, dependent on the frequency of the excitation. This

bandpass filter acts as a combination of a high-pass and a low-pass filter. As illustrated
in the previous cases, it should be evident that one can adjust the filter response as
desired simply by selecting appropriate values for L, C, and R.

Figure 6.18 depicts the normalized frequency response (magnitude and phase) of
the second-order bandpass filter for w, = 1 and various values of Q (and ¢). The
peak displayed in the frequency response around the frequency @, is called a res-
onant peak, and w, is the resonant frequency. Note that as the quality factor Q
increases, the sharpness of the resonance increases and the filter becomes increas-
ingly selective (1.e., it has the ability to filter out most frequency components of the
input signals except for a narrow band around the resonant frequency). One measure
of the selectivity of a bandpass filter is its bandwidth. The concept of bandwidth
can be easily visualized in the plot of Figure 6.18(a) by drawing a horizontal line
across the plot (we have chosen to draw it at the amplitude ratio value of 0.707 for
reasons that will be explained shortly). The frequency range between (magnitude) fre-
quency response points intersecting this horizontal line is defined as the half-power
bandwidth of the filter. The name half-power stems from the fact that when the ampli-
tude response is equal to 0.707 (or 1/./2), the voltage (or current) at the output of the
filter has decreased by the same factor, relative to the maximum value (at the resonant
frequency). Since power in an electric signal is proportional to the square of the volt-
age or current, a drop by a factor 1/./2 in the output voltage or current corresponds
to the power being reduced by a factor of 5. Thus, we term the frequencies at which
the intersection of the 0.707 line with the frequency response occurs the half-power
frequencies. Another useful definition of bandwidth B is as follows. We shall make

values.

(b) R= 10Q;C = 10 uF; L=5 mH.

The frequency response plots in Figures 6.19 and 6.20 confirm these observations.

Comments: It should be apparent that while at the higher and lower frequencies most of the
amplitude of the input signal is filtered from the output, at the midband frequency (4,500 rad/s)
most of the input signal amplitude passes through the filter. The first bandpass filter analyzed in
this example would “pass” the midband range of the audio spectrum, while the second would
pass only a very narrow band of frequencies around the center frequency of 4,500 rad/s.
Such narrowband filters find application in tuning circuits, such as those employed in conven-
tional AM radios (although at frequencies much higher than that of the present example). In

Part I Circuits

a tuning circuit, a narrowband filter is used to tune in a frequency associated with the carrier
of a radio station (e.g., for a station found at a setting of AM 820, the carrier wave trans-
mitted by the radio station is at a frequency of 820 kHz). By using a variable capacitor, it
is possible to tune in a range of carrier frequencies and therefore select the preferred station.
Other circuits are then used to decode the actual speech or music signal modulated on the
carrier wave.

CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Compute the frequencies w, and w for the bandpass filter of Example 6.7 (with R = 1 kQ)

for equating the magnitude of the bandpass filter frequency response to 1/./2 (this will result
in a quadratic equation in w, which can be solved for the two frequencies). Note that these are
the half-power frequencies.

6.3 BODE PLOTS

Frequency response plots of linear systems are often displayed in the form of loga-
rithmic plots, called Bode plots, where the horizontal axis represents frequency on a
logarithmic scale (base 10) and the vertical axis represents the amplitude ratio or phase
of the frequency response function. In Bode plots the amplitude ratio is expressed in
units of decibels (dB), where

Ay Ao
= 20 logo A (6.33)

dB i

The phase shift is expressed in degrees or radians. Frequency is usually plotted on
a logarithmic (base-10) scale as well. Note that the use of the decibel units implies
that one is measuring a ratio. The use of logarithmic scales enables large ranges to
be covered. Furthermore, as shown subsequently in this section, frequency response
plots of high-order systems may be obtained easily from frequency response plots of
the factors of the overall sinusoidal frequency response function, if logarithmic scales
are used for amplitude ratio plots. Consider, for example, the RC low-pass filter of
Example 6.3 (Figure 6.7). The frequency response of this filter can be written in the
form

V, 1 1 a)
2 (jo) = - Z-tan-! (2) 6.34
V, (jo) joloo +1 Te w/oot tan on (6.34)

where t = RC = 1|/q@p and @ is the cutoff, or half-power, frequency of the filter.
Figure 6.21 shows the frequency response plots (magnitude and phase) for this
filter; such plots are termed Bode plots, after the mathematician Hendrik W. Bode. The
normalized frequency on the horizontal axis is wt. One of the great advantages of Bode
plots is that they permit easy straight-line approximations, as illustrated (next page).

Chapter 6 Frequency Response and System Concepts

If we express the magnitude frequency response of the first-order filter (V,/V;) (jo)

Thus, the expression 6.26 is well approximated by a straight line of zero slope at very
low frequencies (equation 6.36). This is the low-frequency asymptotic approximation
of the Bode plot.

If @/wo > 1, we can similarly obtain a high-frequency asymptotic approxima-

Note that equation 6.37 represents a straight line of slope —20 dB per decade (factor-
of-10 increase in frequency). A decade increase in w results in an increase in log w
of unity. Note also that when w equals the cutoff frequency wo, the expression for
|(V,/Vi)(j@)| given by equation 6.37 equals that given by equation 6.36. In other
words, the low- and high-frequency asymptotes intersect at wo. Thus, the magnitude

response Bode plot of a first-order low-pass filter can be easily approximated by two
straight lines intersecting at wo. Figure 6.21(a) clearly shows the approximation.
Consider now the phase angle of the frequency response function

Z(Vo/Vi) (jo) = —tan—!(w /@o). This response can be approximated as follows:
0) when w < wo
—tan7! (=) -7 when w = wo
wo
4

—— when @ > wo

If we (somewhat arbitrarily) agree that w@ < 0.lwo is equivalent to the condition
w/w) <« 1, and that m > 10m is equivalent to the condition w/w) > 1, then
these approximations are summarized by three straight lines: one of zero slope (with
phase equal to 0) for w < 0.1m 9, one with slope —z/4 rad/decade between 0.1a@o
and 10@ , and one of zero slope (with phase equal to —1/2) for w > 10m 9. These
approximations are illustrated in the plot of Figure 6.21(b). What errors are incurred in
making these approximations? Table 6.1 lists the actual errors. Note that the maximum
magnitude response error at the cutoff frequency is —3 dB; thus the cutoff or half-
power frequency is often called 3-dB frequency.

Figure 6.22 depicts the Bode plots for equation 6.38, where the horizontal axis
indicates the normalized frequency w/wo. Asymptotic approximations may again
be determined easily at low and high frequencies. The results are exactly the same
as for the first-order low-pass filter case, except for the sign of the slope: in the
magnitude plot approximation, the straight-line approximation for w/@p > 1 has
a slope of +20 dB/decade, and in the phase plot approximation, the slope of the
line between 0.l@p and 109 is —m/4 rad/decade. You are encouraged to show
that the asymptotic approximations shown in the plots of Figure 6.22 are indeed
correct.

Conclusion

Chapter 6 focuses on the frequency response of linear circuits, and it is a natural extension of the
material covered in Chapter 4. The idea of frequency response extends well beyond electrical
engineering. For example, civil, mechanical, and aeronautical engineering students who study
the vibrations of structures and machinery will find that the same methods are employed in
those fields.

Upon completing this chapter, you should have mastered the following learning

objectives:

1.

Understand the physical significance of frequency domain analysis, and compute the
frequency response of circuits by using AC circuit analysis tools. You had already
acquired the necessary tools (phasor analysis and impedance) to compute the frequency
response of circuits in Chapter 4; in the material presented in Section 6.1, these tools are
put to use to determine the frequency response functions of linear circuits.

Analyze simple first- and second-order electrical filters, and determine their frequency
response and filtering properties. With the concept of frequency response firmly in hand,
now you can analyze the behavior of electrical filters and study the frequency response
characteristics of the most common types, that is, low-pass, high-pass, and bandpass
filters. Filters are very useful devices and are explored in greater depth in Chapter 8.

Compute the frequency response of a circuit and its graphical representation in the form
of a Bode plot. Graphical approximations of Bode plots can be very useful to develop a
quick understanding of the frequency response characteristics of a linear system, almost
by inspection. Bode plots find use in the discipline of automatic control systems,

a subject that is likely to be encountered by most engineering majors.

he aim of this chapter is to introduce the student to simple AC power calcu-

lations and to the generation and distribution of electric power. The chapter

builds on the material developed in Chapter 4—namely, phasors and complex

impedance—and paves the way for the material on electric machines in
Chapter 14.

The chapter starts with the definition of AC average and complex power and
illustrates the computation of the power absorbed by a complex load; special attention
is paid to the calculation of the power factor, and to power factor correction. The next
subject is a brief discussion of ideal transformers and of maximum power transfer.
This is followed by an introduction to three-phase power. The chapter ends with a
discussion of electric power generation and distribution.

7.1 POWER IN AC CIRCUITS

The objective of this section is to introduce AC power. As already mentioned in
Chapter 4, 50- or 60-Hz AC electric power constitutes the most common form of
electric power distribution; in this section, the phasor notation developed in Chapter 4
will be employed to analyze the power absorbed by both resistive and complex loads.

Instantaneous and Average Power

From Chapter 4, you already know that when a linear electric circuit is excited by a
sinusoidal source, all voltages and currents in the circuit are also sinusoids of the same
frequency as that of the excitation source. Figure 7.1 depicts the general form of a
linear AC circuit. The most general expressions for the voltage and current delivered
to an arbitrary load are as follows:

v(t) = Vcos(wt — Oy)

i(t) = I cos(wt — 67) (7.1)

where V and / are the peak amplitudes of the sinusoidal voltage and current,
respectively, and Oy and 6; are their phase angles. Two such waveforms are plot-
ted in Figure 7.2, with unit amplitude and with phase angles 6y = 2/6 and 6; = 1/3.
The phase shift between source and load is therefore 6 = Oy — 6;. It will be easier,
for the purpose of this section, to assume that 6y = 0, without any loss of generality,
since all phase angles will be referenced to the source voltage’s phase. In Section 7.2,
where complex power is introduced, you will see that this assumption is not neces-
sary since phasor notation is used. In this section, some of the trigonometry-based
derivations are simpler if the source voltage reference phase is assumed to be zero.

Since the instantaneous power dissipated by a circuit element is given by the
product of the instantaneous voltage and current, it is possible to obtain a general
expression for the power dissipated by an AC circuit element:

p(t) = v(t)i(t) = VI cos(@t) cos(wt — @) (7.2)

Equation 7.2 can be further simplified with the aid of trigonometric identities to yield

p(t) = > cos(@) + > cos(2wt — @) (7.3)

where 6 is the difference in phase between voltage and current. Equation 7.3 illustrates
how the instantaneous power dissipated by an AC circuit element is equal to the sum
of an average component SV cos(@) and a sinusoidal component $V cos(2mt — 0),
oscillating at a frequency double that of the original source frequency.

The instantaneous and average power are plotted in Figure 7.3 for the signals
of Figure 7.2. The average power corresponding to the voltage and current signals of
equation 7.1 can be obtained by integrating the instantaneous power over one cycle
of the sinusoidal signal. Let T = 27/w represent one cycle of the sinusoidal signals.
Then the average power P,, is given by the integral of the instantaneous power p(t)

As shown in Figure 7.1, the same analysis carried out in equations 7.1 to 7.3
can also be repeated using phasor analysis. In phasor notation, the current and voltage
of equation 7.1 are given by

V(jo) = Ve" (7.6)

by the phasor voltage and current of equations 7.6 and 7.7 to be

AC Power Notation

It has already been noted that AC power systems operate at a fixed frequency; in
North America, this frequency is 60 cycles per second, or hertz (Hz), corresponding
to a radian frequency

@ = 27 - 60 = 377 rad/s AC power frequency (7.10)

In Europe and most other parts of the world, AC power is generated at a frequency
of 50 Hz (this is the reason why some appliances will not operate under one of the
two systems).

Therefore, for the remainder of this chapter the radian frequency w is fixed at
377 rad/s, unless otherwise noted.

Part I Circuits

With knowledge of the radian frequency of all voltages and currents, it will always be
possible to compute the exact magnitude and phase of any impedance in a
circuit.

A second point concerning notation is related to the factor $ in equation 7.9. It
is customary in AC power analysis to employ the rms value of the AC voltages and
currents in the circuit (see Section 4.2). Use of the rms value eliminates the factor
5 in power expressions and leads to considerable simplification. Thus, the following
expressions will be used in this chapter:

graphical interpretation of impedance as a vector in the complex plane. From the R
figure, it is simple to verify that Vs
R= |Z|cos@ (7.14) ix
X =(|Z|sind (7.15)

Finally, the amplitudes of phasor voltages and currents will be denoted through-
out this chapter by means of the rms amplitude. We therefore introduce a slight mod- oe x
ification in the phasor notation of Chapter 4 by defining the following rms phasor ——— |
quantities: R

In other words,

Throughout the remainder of this chapter, the symbols V and J will denote the LOt
rms value of a voltage or a current, and the symbols V and I will denote rms
phasor voltages and currents.

Also recall the use of the symbol 7 to represent the complex exponential. Thus,
the sinusoidal waveform corresponding to the phasor current I = J 76; corresponds
to the time-domain waveform

i(t) = V2I cos(wt + 6;) (7.18)
and the sinusoidal form of the phasor voltage V = V Z6y is
v(t) = V2V cos(wt + Oy) (7.19)

The instantaneous power is given by the expression
p(t) = v(t) x i(t) = V2 x 10sin(3771) x V2 x 2cos(377t — 2.215)  W

The instantaneous voltage and current waveforms and the instantaneous and average power
are plotted in Figure 7.6.

Comments: Please pay attention to the use of rms values in this example: It is very important
to remember that we have defined phasors to have rms amplitude in the power calculation.
This is a standard procedure in electrical engineering practice.

Note that the instantaneous power can be negative for brief periods of time, even though
the average power is positive.

Power Factor

The phase angle of the load impedance plays a very important role in the absorption
of power by a load impedance. As illustrated in equation 7.13 and in the preceding
examples, the average power dissipated by an AC load is dependent on the cosine of
the angle of the impedance. To recognize the importance of this factor in AC power
computations, the term cos(@) is referred to as the power factor (pf). Note that the
power factor is equal to 0 for a purely inductive or capacitive load and equal to | for
a purely resistive load; in every other case,

O<pf <1 (7.20)

Two equivalent expressions for the power factor are given in the following:
Pay
pf = cos(@) = ai Power factor (7.21)

where V and / are the rms values of the load voltage and current, respectively.

7.2 COMPLEX POWER

The expression for the instantaneous power given in equation 7.3 may be expanded
to provide further insight into AC power. Using trigonometric identities, we obtain

Chapter 7 AC Power

the following expressions:

V2

pit) = zoos 6 + cos @ cos(2mt) + sin @ sin(2at)]
~5 (7.22)
= I*|Z|[cos@ + cos @ cos(2wt) + sin 6 sin(2mr)]

= [?|Z| cos 0(1 + cos 2wt) + I?|Z| sin 6 sin(2at)

Recalling the geometric interpretation of the impedance Z of Figure 7.4, you may
recognize that

|Z|cos@ =R

and (7.23)
|Z| sind = X

are the resistive and reactive components of the load impedance, respectively. On the
basis of this fact, it becomes possible to write the instantaneous power as

p(t) = PRU + cos 2@t) + PX sin(2ot)

- . . 7.24
=1?R+I’Rcos(2at) +1°X sin(2ot) (7.24)

The physical interpretation of this expression for the instantaneous power should be
intuitively appealing at this point. As equation 7.24 suggests, the instantaneous power
dissipated by a complex load consists of the following three components:

An average component, which is constant; this is called the average
power and is denoted by the symbol P,,:

P, =IR (7.25)
where R = ReZ.
A time-varying (sinusoidal) component with zero average value that is

contributed by the power fluctuations in the resistive component of the
load and is denoted by pr(t):

t) =I’Rcos2ot

Pr(t) (7.26)
= P,, cos 2wt

A time-varying (sinusoidal) component with zero average value, due to
the power fluctuation in the reactive component of the load and denoted
by px (¢):

px (t) =1°X sin 2t
= Qsin 2wt

(7.27)

where X = Im Z and Q is called the reactive power. Note that since
reactive elements can only store energy and not dissipate it, there is no
net average power absorbed by X.

Part I Circuits

Since P,, corresponds to the power absorbed by the load resistance, it is also called
the real power, measured in units of watts (W). On the other hand, Q takes the name
of reactive power, since it is associated with the load reactance. Table 7.1 shows the
general methods of calculating P and Q.

The units of Q are volt amperes reactive, or VAR. Note that Q represents an
exchange of energy between the source and the reactive part of the load; thus, no net
power is gained or lost in the process, since the average reactive power is zero. In
general, it is desirable to minimize the reactive power in a load. Example 7.6 will
explain the reason for this statement.

The computation of AC power is greatly simplified by defining a fictitious but
very useful quantity called the complex power S

S=VI*

Complex power (7.28)

where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate (see Appendix A online). You may
easily verify that this definition leads to the convenient expression

S =Vicosé+jVisin@ =’R+jrX =PZ
or (7.29)

S=P,+jQ

The complex power S may be interpreted graphically as a vector in the complex plane,
as shown in Figure 7.11.

The magnitude of S, denoted by |S|, is measured in units of volt amperes (VA)
and is called the apparent power, because this is the quantity one would compute
by measuring the rms load voltage and currents without regard for the phase angle
of the load. Note that the right triangle of Figure 7.11 is similar to the right triangle
of Figure 7.4, since @ is the load impedance angle. The complex power may also
be expressed by the product of the square of the rms current through the load and the
complex load impedance:

S=PZ

or (7.30)
PR+jPX =PZ
or, equivalently, by the ratio of the square of the rms voltage across the load to the

complex conjugate of the load impedance:

172
S= = (7.31)

The power triangle and complex power greatly simplify load power calcula-
tions, as illustrated in the following examples.

Although the reactive power does not contribute to any average power dissi-
pation in the load, it may have an adverse effect on power consumption, because it
increases the overall rms current flowing in the circuit. Recall from Example 7.2 that
the presence of any source resistance (typically, the resistance of the line wires in AC
power circuits) will cause a loss of power; the power loss due to this line resistance
is unrecoverable and constitutes a net loss for the electric company, since the user
never receives this power. Example 7.6 illustrates quantitatively the effect of such
line losses in an AC circuit.

Power Factor, Revisited

The power factor, defined earlier as the cosine of the angle of the load impedance,
plays a very important role in AC power. A power factor close to unity signifies an
efficient transfer of energy from the AC source to the load, while a small power factor
corresponds to inefficient use of energy, as illustrated in Example 7.6. It should be
apparent that if a load requires a fixed amount of real power P,,, the source will
be providing the smallest amount of current when the power factor is the greatest,
that is, when cos @ = 1. If the power factor is less than unity, some additional current
will be drawn from the source, lowering the efficiency of power transfer from the
source to the load. However, it will be shown shortly that it is possible to correct
the power factor of a load by adding an appropriate reactive component to the load
itself.

Since the reactive power Q is related to the reactive part of the load, its sign
depends on whether the load reactance is inductive or capacitive. This leads to the
following important statement:

If the load has an inductive reactance, then 0 is positive and the current lags (or
follows) the voltage. Thus, when @ and Q are positive, the corresponding power
factor is termed lagging. Conversely, a capacitive load will have a negative Q
and hence a negative 0. This corresponds to a leading power factor, meaning
that the load current leads the load voltage.

Table 7.2 illustrates the concept and summarizes all the important points so far. In the
table, the phasor voltage V has a zero phase angle, and the current phasor is referenced
to the phase of V.

The distinction between leading and lagging power factors made in Table 7.2
is important, because it corresponds to opposite signs of the reactive power: Q is
positive if the load is inductive (6 > 0) and the power factor is lagging; Q is negative
if the load is capacitive and the power factor is leading (6 < 0). It is therefore possible
to improve the power factor of a load according to a procedure called power factor
correction, that is, by placing a suitable reactance in parallel with the load so that the
reactive power component generated by the additional reactance is of opposite sign to
the original load reactive power. Most often the need is to improve the power factor of
an inductive load, because many common industrial loads consist of electric motors,
which are predominantly inductive loads. This improvement may be accomplished
by placing a capacitance in parallel with the load. Example 7.8 illustrates a typical
power factor correction for an industrial load.

The power triangle corresponding to this circuit is drawn in Figure 7.19. The vector
diagram shows how the complex power S results from the vector addition of the two
components P and Q,. To eliminate the reactive power due to the inductance, we will
need to add an equal and opposite reactive power component —Q,, as described below.

2. To compute the reactance needed for the power factor correction, we observe that we need
to contribute a negative reactive power equal to —118.5 VAR. This requires a negative

Q, = 1.429 x 10° x sin(0.795) = 102 kVAR

where, once again, 6, is positive because pf, is lagging and 0) is negative because pf, is

7.3 TRANSFORMERS

AC circuits are very commonly connected to each other by means of transformers.
Atransformer is a device that couples two AC circuits magnetically rather than through
any direct conductive connection and permits a “transformation” of the voltage and
current between one circuit and the other (e.g., by matching a high-voltage, low-
current AC output to a circuit requiring a low-voltage, high-current source). Trans-
formers play a major role in electric power engineering and are a necessary part of the
electric power distribution network. The objective of this section is to introduce the
ideal transformer and the concepts of impedance reflection and impedance matching.
The physical operations of practical transformers, and more advanced models, is
discussed in Chapter 14.

The Ideal Transformer

The ideal transformer consists of two coils that are coupled to each other by some
magnetic medium. There is no electrical connection between the coils. The coil on
the input side is termed the primary, and that on the output side the secondary. The

304

Primary Secondary

transformer

Figure 7.26 Center-tapped
transformer

Chapter 7 AC Power

primary coil is wound so that it has nm; turns, while the secondary has nz turns. We
define the turns ratio N as

nae (7.32)
ny
Figure 7.25 illustrates the convention by which voltages and currents are usually
assigned at a transformer. The dots in Figure 7.25 are related to the polarity of the
coil voltage: coil terminals marked with a dot have the same polarity.

Since an ideal inductor acts as a short circuit in the presence of DC, transformers
do not perform any useful function when the primary voltage is DC. However, when
a time-varying current flows in the primary winding, a corresponding time-varying
voltage is generated in the secondary because of the magnetic coupling between the
two coils. This behavior is due to Faraday’s law, as explained in Chapter 14. The
relationship between primary and secondary current in an ideal transformer is very
simply stated as follows:

Vo =NV,

Ideal transformer (7.33)

An ideal transformer multiplies a sinusoidal input voltage by a factor of N and
divides a sinusoidal input current by a factor of NV.

If N is greater than 1, the output voltage is greater than the input voltage and the
transformer is called a step-up transformer. If N is less than 1, then the transformer
is called a step-down transformer, since Voi is now smaller than Vi. An ideal trans-
former can be used in either direction (i.e., either of its coils may be viewed as the
input side, or primary). Finally, a transformer with N = 1 is called an isolation
transformer and may perform a very useful function if one needs to electrically iso-
late two circuits from each other; note that any DC at the primary will not appear at
the secondary coil. An important property of ideal transformers is the conservation
of power; one can easily verify that an ideal transformer conserves power, since

a ~W «=
8, =fV, = NET = [V2 = (7.34)

That is, the power on the primary side equals that on the secondary.

In many practical circuits, the secondary is tapped at two different points, giving
rise to two separate output circuits, as shown in Figure 7.26. The most common
configuration is the center-tapped transformer, which splits the secondary voltage
into two equal voltages. The most common occurrence of this type of transformer is
found at the entry of a power line into a household, where a high-voltage primary
(see Figure 7.52) is transformed to 240 V and split into two 120-V lines. Thus, V>
and V3 in Figure 7.26 are both 120-V lines, and a 240-V line (V> + V3) is also
available.

Acenter-tapped power transformer has a primary voltage of 4,800 V and two 120-V secondaries

is known.

Assumptions: Use rms values for all phasor quantities in the problem.

Analysis: Since we have no information about the number of windings or about the secondary
current, we cannot solve this problem by using equation 7.33. An alternative approach is to
apply conservation of power (equation 7.34). Since the loads all have unity power factor,
the voltages and currents will all be in phase, and we can use the rms amplitudes in our
calculations:

Impedance Reflection and Power Transfer

As stated in the preceding paragraphs, transformers are commonly used to couple one
AC circuit to another. A very common and rather general situation is that depicted in
Figure 7.27, where an AC soutce, represented by its Thévenin equivalent, is connected
to an equivalent load impedance by means of a transformer.

Part I Circuits

It should be apparent that expressing the circuit in phasor form does not alter
the basic properties of the ideal transformer, as illustrated in the following equations:

Vi => ae I, = NI,
N i (7.35)
= = z 1
Vv. =NV iL -—
2 1 2 N

These expressions are very useful in determining the equivalent impedance seen by
the source and by the load, on opposite sides of the transformer. At the primary
connection, the equivalent impedance seen by the source must equal the ratio of
V, tol,

Vv
Z=as (7.36)
1,
which can be written as
V,/N 1V
zi = V2/N _— (7.37)
Ni, N* I,
But the ratio Vo / L is, by definition, the load impedance Z,. Thus,
1
Z= yoZe (7.38)

That is, the AC source “sees” the load impedance reduced by a factor of 1/N?.
The load impedance also sees an equivalent source. The open-circuit voltage is
given by

Voc = NV; =NVs (7.39)

since there is no voltage drop across the source impedance in the circuit of Figure 7.27.
The short-circuit current is given by

- Vs 1
Isc = —— = 7.40
sc = Fy (7.40)
and the load sees a Thévenin impedance equal to
Vv NV.
Z- = ° =N°Zs (7.41)

Isc (Ws/Zs)C/N)

Thus the load sees the source impedance multiplied by a factor of N*. Figure 7.28
illustrates this impedance reflection across a transformer. It is very important to note
that an ideal transformer changes the magnitude of the load impedance seen by the
source by a factor of 1/N?. This property naturally leads to the discussion of power
transfer, which we consider next.

Recall that in DC circuits, given a fixed equivalent source, maximum power is
transferred to a resistive load when the latter is equal to the internal resistance of the
source; achieving an analogous maximum power transfer condition in an AC circuit
is referred to as impedance matching. Consider the general form of an AC circuit,
shown in Figure 7.29, and assume that the source impedance Zs is given by

Zs = Rs +jXs (7.42)

The problem of interest is often that of selecting the load resistance and reactance
that will maximize the real (average) power absorbed by the load. Note that the

when the load impedance is equal to the complex conjugate of the source impedance,
as shown in the following equation:

ZL =Z5 Maximum power transfer
that is, (7.48)

R, =Rs

When the load impedance is equal to the complex conjugate of the source
impedance, the load and source impedances are matched and maximum power
is transferred to the load.

In many cases, it may not be possible to select a matched load impedance,
because of physical limitations in the selection of appropriate components. In these
situations, it is possible to use the impedance reflection properties of a transformer to
maximize the transfer of AC power to the load. The circuit of Figure 7.30 illustrates
how the reflected load impedance, as seen by the source, is equal to Z,/N7, so that
maximum power transfer occurs when

of the step-down transformer to obtain

7.4 THREE-PHASE POWER

The material presented so far in this chapter has dealt exclusively with single-phase
AC power, that is, with single sinusoidal sources. In fact, most of the AC power used
today is generated and distributed as three-phase power, by means of an arrangement
in which three sinusoidal voltages are generated out of phase with one another. The
primary reason is efficiency: The weight of the conductors and other components
in a three-phase system is much lower than that in a single-phase system delivering
the same amount of power. Further, while the power produced by a single-phase
system has a pulsating nature (recall the results of Section 7.1), a three-phase system
can deliver a steady, constant supply of power. For example, later in this section it
will be shown that a three-phase generator producing three balanced voltages—that
is, voltages of equal amplitude and frequency displaced in phase by 120°—has the
property of delivering constant instantaneous power.

Another important advantage of three-phase power is that, as will be explained
in Chapter 15, three-phase motors have a nonzero starting torque, unlike their single-
phase counterpart. The change to three-phase AC power systems from the early DC
system proposed by Edison was therefore due to a number of reasons: the efficiency
resulting from transforming voltages up and down to minimize transmission losses
over long distances; the ability to deliver constant power (an ability not shared by
single- and two-phase AC systems); a more efficient use of conductors; and the ability
to provide starting torque for industrial motors.

To begin the discussion of three-phase power, consider a three-phase source
connected in the wye (or Y) configuration, as shown in Figure 7.34. Each of the
three voltages is 120° out of phase with the others, so that, using phasor notation,

Chapter 7 AC Power

we may write

Van = Van Z0°
Vin = VinZ—(120°) Phase voltages (7.50)

Ven = Ven Z(—240°) = VenZ120°

where the quantities Vans Vons and Ven are rms values and are equal to each other. To
simplify the notation, it will be assumed from here on that

Van = Vin = Ven = V (7.51)

In the circuit of Figure 7.34, the resistive loads are also wye-connected and balanced
(i.e., equal). The three AC sources are all connected together at a node called the
neutral node, denoted by n. The voltages Vans Vins and Ven are called the phase
voltages and form a balanced set in the sense that

Van + Von + Ven =0 (7.52)

This last statement is easily verified by sketching the phasor diagram. The sequence
of phasor voltages shown in Figure 7.35 is usually referred to as the positive (or abc)
sequence.

Consider now the “lines” connecting each source to the load, and observe that it
is possible to also define line voltages (also called line-to-line voltages) by considering
the voltages between lines aa’ and bb’, lines aa’ and cc’, and lines bb’ and cc’. Since
the line voltage, say, between aa’ and bb’ is given by

Vab = Van + Vab = Van — Vin (7.53)

the line voltages may be computed relative to the phase voltages as follows:

Vap = VZ0° — VZ(—120°) = V3V.230°
Vie = VZ(—120°) — V.Z120° = V3V Z(—90°)

Line

voltages (7.54)

Vea = VZ120° — VZ0° = V3V.Z150°

It can be seen, then, that the magnitude of the line voltages is equal to /3 times
the magnitude of the phase voltages. It is instructive, at least once, to point out that
the circuit of Figure 7.34 can be redrawn to have the appearance of the circuit of
Figure 7.36, where it is clear that the three circuits are in parallel.

Part I Circuits

One of the important features of a balanced three-phase system is that it does
not require a fourth wire (the neutral connection), since the current I, is identically
zero (for balanced load Z, = Z, = Z. = Z). This can be shown by applying KCL at
the neutral node n:

L,=1,+1,+1,
1 ~ ~ ~
= Z (Van + Von + Ven) (7.55)

=0

Another, more important characteristic of a balanced three-phase power system
may be illustrated by simplifying the circuits of Figures 7.34 and 7.36 by replacing
the balanced load impedances with three equal resistances R. With this simplified
configuration, one can show that the total power delivered to the balanced load by
the three-phase generator is constant. This is an extremely important result, for a very
practical reason: Delivering power in a smooth fashion (as opposed to the pulsating
nature of single-phase power) reduces the wear and stress on the generating equip-
ment. Although we have not yet discussed the nature of the machines used to generate
power, a useful analogy here is that of a single-cylinder engine versus a perfectly bal-
anced V-8 engine. To show that the total power delivered by the three sources to a
balanced resistive load is constant, consider the instantaneous power delivered by
each source:

It is also possible to connect the three AC sources in a three-phase system in
a delta (or A) connection, although in practice this configuration is rarely used.

fact is shown explicitly in Figure 7.39, where n and n’ are connected to each other directly.

Balanced Wye Loads

In the previous section we performed some power computations for a purely resistive
balanced wye load. We now generalize those results for an arbitrary balanced complex
load. Consider again the circuit of Figure 7.34, where now the balanced load consists
of the three complex impedances

Zq = Ly =Z. = Z, =|Z,|L0 (7.58)

From the diagram of Figure 7.34, it can be verified that each impedance sees the
corresponding phase voltage across itself; thus, since currents 1, I,, and I. have the
same rms value /, the phase angles of the currents will differ by +120°. It is therefore
possible to compute the power for each phase by considering the phase voltage (equal
to the load voltage) for each impedance, and the associated line current. Let us denote
the complex power for each phase by S

S =VI* (7.59)
so that
S=P+jQ
/ (7.60)

= Vi cos@ + jVI sin
where V and / denote, once again, the rms values of each phase voltage and line
current, respectively. Consequently, the total real power delivered to the balanced
wye load is 3P, and the total reactive power is 3Q. Thus, the total complex power Sr
is given by
Sr = Pr +jQr = 3P +j3Q

= ¥3P)* + (3Q)*260

and the apparent power is

(7.61)

[Sr] = afin? cos? 6 + (VI)? sin” 6

and the total real and reactive power may be expressed in terms of the apparent
power:

Balanced Delta Loads

In addition to a wye connection, it is possible to connect a balanced load in the delta
configuration. A wye-connected generator and a delta-connected load are shown in
Figure 7.40.

Note immediately that now the corresponding line voltage (not phase voltage)
appears across each impedance. For example, the voltage across Z.y is Vea: Thus,
the three load currents are given by

To understand the relationship between delta-connected and wye-connected
loads, it is reasonable to ask the question, For what value of Z, would a delta-
connected load draw the same amount of current as a wye-connected load with
impedance Z, for a given source voltage? This is equivalent to asking what value
of Z, would make the line currents the same in both circuits (compare Figure 7.36
with Figure 7.40).

One can readily verify that the two currents (Iq) a and (Iu), will be equal if the
magnitude of the delta-connected impedance is 3 times larger than Z,:

Za = 3Z, (7.66)

This result also implies that a delta load will necessarily draw 3 times as much current
(and therefore absorb 3 times as much power) as a wye load with the same branch

impedance.

7.5 RESIDENTIAL WIRING; GROUNDING
AND SAFETY

Common residential electric power service consists of a three-wire AC system sup-
plied by the local power company. The three wires originate from a utility pole and
consist of a neutral wire, which is connected to earth ground, and two “hot” wires.
Each of the hot lines supplies 120 V rms to the residential circuits; the two lines are
180° out of phase, for reasons that will become apparent during the course of this
discussion. The phasor line voltages, shown in Figure 7.44, are usually referred to
by means of a subscript convention derived from the color of the insulation on the
different wires: W for white (neutral), B for black (hot), and R for red (hot). This
convention is adhered to uniformly.
The voltages across the hot lines are given by

Ve — Vr = Var = Vp — (—Vp) = 2Vz = 24020° (7.67)

Thus, the voltage between the hot wires is actually 240 V rms. Appliances such as elec-
tric stoves, air conditioners, and heaters are powered by the 240-V rms arrangement.
On the other hand, lighting and all the electric outlets in the house used for small
appliances are powered by a single 120-V rms line.

The use of 240-V rms service for appliances that require a substantial amount
of power to operate is dictated by power transfer considerations. Consider the two
circuits shown in Figure 7.45. In delivering the necessary power to a load, a lower
line loss will be incurred with the 240-V rms wiring, since the power loss in the
lines (the I?R loss, as it is commonly referred to) is directly related to the current
required by the load. In an effort to minimize line losses, the size of the wires is
increased for the lower-voltage case. This typically reduces the wire resistance by a
factor of 2. In the top circuit, assuming Rs/2 = 0.01 Q, the current required by the
10-kW load is approximately 83.3 A, while in the bottom circuit, with Rs = 0.02 Q,
it is approximately one-half as much (41.7 A). (You should be able to verify that the

approximate /7R losses are 69.4 W in the top circuit and 34.7 W in the bottom circuit.)
Limiting the /R losses is important from the viewpoint of efficiency, besides reducing
the amount of heat generated in the wiring for safety considerations. Figure 7.46 shows
some typical wiring configurations for a home. Note that several circuits are wired
and fused separately.

used to connect the chassis of the appliance to earth ground. Without this provision,
the appliance chassis could be at any potential with respect to ground, possibly even
at the hot wire’s potential if a segment of the hot wire were to lose some insulation and
come in contact with the inside of the chassis! Poorly grounded appliances can thus
be a significant hazard. Figure 7.48 illustrates schematically how, even though the
chassis is intended to be insulated from the electric circuit, an unintended connection
(represented by the dashed line) may occur, for example, because of corrosion or a
loose mechanical connection. A path to ground might be provided by the body of
a person touching the chassis with a hand. In the figure, such an undesired ground
loop current is indicated by J/g. In this case, the ground current Jg would flow directly
through the body to ground and could be harmful.

In some cases the danger posed by such undesired ground loops can be great,
leading to death by electric shock. Figure 7.49 describes the effects of electric cur-
rents on an average male when the point of contact is dry skin. Particularly hazardous
conditions are liable to occur whenever the natural resistance to current flow pro-
vided by the skin breaks down, as would happen in the presence of water. Thus, the
danger presented to humans by unsafe electric circuits is very much dependent on
the particular conditions—whenever water or moisture is present, the natural elec-
trical resistance of dry skin, or of dry shoe soles, decreases dramatically, and even
relatively low voltages can lead to fatal currents. Proper grounding procedures, such
as are required by the National Electrical Code, help prevent fatalities due to elec-
tric shock. The ground fault circuit interrupter, labeled GFCI in Figure 7.46,
is a special safety circuit used primarily with outdoor circuits and in bathrooms,

where the risk of death by electric shock is greatest. Its application is best described by
an example.

Consider the case of an outdoor pool surrounded by a metal fence, which uses
an existing light pole for a post, as shown in Figure 7.50. The light pole and the
metal fence can be considered as forming a chassis. If the fence were not prop-
erly grounded all the way around the pool and if the light fixture were poorly
insulated from the pole, a path to ground could easily be created by an unaware swim-
mer reaching, say, for the metal gate. A GFCI provides protection from potentially
lethal ground loops, such as this one, by sensing both the hot-wire (B) and the neu-
tral (W) currents. If the difference between the hot-wire current Jz and the neu-
tral current Jw is more than a few milliamperes, then the GFCI disconnects the
circuit nearly instantaneously. Any significant difference between the hot and neu-
tral (return-path) currents means that a second path to ground has been created (by
the unfortunate swimmer, in this example) and a potentially dangerous condition
has arisen. Figure 7.51 illustrates the idea. GFCIs are typically resettable circuit
breakers, so that one does not need to replace a fuse every time the GFCI circuit is
enabled.

7.6 GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION
OF AC POWER

We now conclude the discussion of power systems with a brief description of the vari-
ous elements of a power system. Electric power originates from a variety of sources. In
general, electric power may be obtained from hydroelectric, thermoelectric, geother-
mal, wind, solar, and nuclear sources. The choice of a given source is typically dic-
tated by the power requirement for the given application, and by economic and en-
vironmental factors. In this section, the structure of an AC power network, from the
power-generating station to the residential circuits discussed in Section 7.5, is briefly
outlined.

Atypical generator will produce electric power at 18 kV, as shown in the diagram
of Figure 7.52. To minimize losses along the conductors, the output of the generators
is processed through a step-up transformer to achieve line voltages of hundreds of
kilovolts (345 kV, in Figure 7.52). Without this transformation, the majority of the
power generated would be lost in the transmission lines that carry the electric current
from the power station.

The local electric company operates a power-generating plant that is capable of
supplying several hundred megavolt-amperes (MVA) on a three-phase basis. For this
reason, the power company uses a three-phase step-up transformer at the generation
plant to increase the line voltage to around 345 kV. One can immediately see that
at the rated power of the generator (in megavolt-amperes) there will be a significant
reduction of current beyond the step-up transformer.

Chapter 7 AC Power

Beyond the generation plant, an electric power network distributes energy to
several substations. This network is usually referred to as the power grid. At the
substations, the voltage is stepped down to a lower level (10 to 150 kV, typically).
Some very large loads (e.g., an industrial plant) may be served directly from the power
grid, although most loads are supplied by individual substations in the power grid. At
the local substations (one of which you may have seen in your own neighborhood),
the voltage is stepped down further by a three-phase step-down transformer to 4,800
V. These substations distribute the energy to residential and industrial customers. To
further reduce the line voltage to levels that are safe for residential use, step-down
transformers are mounted on utility poles. These drop the voltage to the 120/240-V
three-wire single-phase residential service discussed in Section 7.5. Industrial and
commercial customers receive 460- and/or 208-V three-phase service.

Conclusion

Chapter 7 introduces the essential elements that permit the analysis of AC power systems. AC
power is essential to all industrial activities, and to the conveniences we are accustomed to in
residential life. Virtually all engineers will be exposed to AC power systems in their careers,
and the material presented in this chapter provides all the necessary tools to understand the
analysis of AC power circuits. Upon completing this chapter, you should have mastered the
following learning objectives:

1. Understand the meaning of instantaneous and average power, master AC power
notation, and compute average power for AC circuits. Compute the power factor of a
complex load. The power dissipated by a load in an AC circuit consists of the sum of an
average and a fluctuating component. In practice, the average power is the quantity of
interest.

2. Learn complex power notation; compute apparent, real, and reactive power for complex
loads. Draw the power triangle, and compute the capacitor size required to perform
power factor correction on a load. AC power can best be analyzed with the aid of
complex notation. Complex power S is defined as the product of the phasor load voltage
and the complex conjugate of the load current. The real part of S is the real power
actually consumed by a load (that for which the user is charged); the imaginary part of S
is called the reactive power and corresponds to energy stored in the circuit—it cannot be
directly used for practical purposes. Reactive power is quantified by a quantity called
the power factor, and it can be minimized through a procedure called power factor
correction.

3. Analyze the ideal transformer; compute primary and secondary currents and voltages
and turns ratios. Calculate reflected sources and impedances across ideal transformers.
Understand maximum power transfer. Transformers find many applications in electrical
engineering. One of the most common is in power transmission and distribution, where
the electric power generated at electric power plants is stepped “up” and “down”
before and after transmission, to improve the overall efficiency of electric power
distribution.

4. Learn three-phase AC power notation; compute load currents and voltages for balanced
wye and delta loads. AC power is generated and distributed in three-phase form.
Residential services are typically single-phase (making use of only one branch of the
three-phase lines), while industrial applications are often served directly by three-phase
power.

5. Understand the basic principles of residential electrical wiring, of electrical safety, and
of the generation and distribution of AC power.

7.50 A method for determining the equivalent circuit of

a transformer consists of two tests: the open-circuit test
and the short-circuit test. The open-circuit test, shown
in Figure P7.50(a), is usually done by applying rated
voltage to the primary side of the transformer while
leaving the secondary side open. The current into the
primary side is measured, as is the power dissipated.

The short-circuit test, shown in Figure P7.50(b),
is performed by increasing the primary voltage until
rated current is going into the transformer while the
secondary side is short-circuited. The current into the
transformer, the applied voltage, and the power
dissipated are measured.

The equivalent circuit of a transformer is shown
in Figure P7.50(c), where r,, and L,, represent the
winding resistance and inductance, respectively, and r,
and L, represent the losses in the core of the
transformer and the inductance of the core. The ideal
transformer is also included in the model.

With the open-circuit test, we may assume that
Ip = Is = 0. Then all the current that is measured is
directed through the parallel combination of r, and L,.
We also assume that |r.||j@L,| is much greater than
ry +joL,,. Using these assumptions and the
open-circuit test data, we can find the resistance r, and
the inductance L,.

334

Chapter 7 AC Power

In the short-circuit test, we assume that Veecondary is
zero, so that the voltage on the primary side of the ideal

transformer is also zero, causing no current flow through the
r- — L, parallel combination. Using this assumption with
the short-circuit test data, we are able to find the resistance

ry, and inductance L,,.

Using the following test data, find the equivalent

tests are performed at 60 Hz.

7.52 A method of thermal treatment for a steel pipe is to

heat the pipe by the Joule effect, flowing a current
directly in the pipe. In most cases, a low-voltage
high-current transformer is used to deliver the current
through the pipe. In this problem, we consider a
single-phase transformer at 220 V rms, which delivers
1 V. Due to the pipe’s resistance variation with
temperature, a secondary voltage regulation is needed
in the range of 10 percent, as shown in Figure P7.52.
The voltage regulation is obtained with five different
slots in the primary winding (high-voltage regulation).
Assuming that the secondary coil has two turns, find
the number of turns for each slot.

OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIERS

n this chapter we analyze the properties of the ideal amplifier and explore the
features of a general-purpose amplifier circuit known as the operational amplifier
(op-amp). Understanding the gain and frequency response properties of the
operational amplifier is essential for the user of electronic instrumentation. For-
tunately, the availability of operational amplifiers in integrated-circuit form has made
the task of analyzing such circuits quite simple. The models presented in this chapter
are based on concepts that have already been explored at length in earlier chapters,
namely, Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits and frequency response ideas.
Mastery of operational amplifier fundamentals is essential in any practical
application of electronics. This chapter is aimed at developing your understanding
of the fundamental properties of practical operational amplifiers. A number of useful
applications are introduced in the examples and homework problems.

8.1 IDEAL AMPLIFIERS

One of the most important functions in electronic instrumentation is that of amplifi-
cation. The need to amplify low-level electric signals arises frequently in a number
of applications. Perhaps the most familiar use of amplifiers arises in converting the
low-voltage signal from a cassette tape player, a radio receiver, or a compact disk
player to a level suitable for driving a pair of speakers. Figure 8.1 depicts a typical
arrangement. Amplifiers have a number of applications of interest to the non-electrical
engineer, such as the amplification of low-power signals from transducers (e.g., bio-
electrodes, strain gauges, thermistors, and accelerometers) and other, less obvious
functions that will be reviewed in this chapter, for example, filtering and impedance
isolation. We turn first to the general features and characteristics of amplifiers, before
delving into the analysis of the operational amplifier.

Ideal Amplifier Characteristics

The simplest model for an amplifier is depicted in Figure 8.2, where a signal vs (ft) is
shown being amplified by a constant factor A, called the gain of the amplifier. Ideally,
the load voltage should be given by the expression

uL(t) = Avs(t) (8.1)

Note that the source has been modeled as a Thévenin equivalent, and the load as
an equivalent resistance. Thévenin’s theorem guarantees that this picture can be

Part II Electronics

representative of more complex circuits. Hence, the equivalent source circuit is the
circuit the amplifier “sees” from its input port; and R,, the load, is the equivalent
resistance seen from the output port of the amplifier.

What would happen if the roles were reversed? That is, what does the source see
when it “looks” into the input port of the amplifier, and what does the load see when it
“looks” into the output port of the amplifier? While it is not clear at this point how one
might characterize the internal circuitry of an amplifier (which is rather complex), it
can be presumed that the amplifier will act as an equivalent load with respect to the
source and as an equivalent source with respect to the load. After all, this is a direct
application of Thévenin’s theorem. Figure 8.3 provides a pictorial representation of
this simplified characterization of an amplifier. The “black box” of Figure 8.2 is now
represented as an equivalent circuit with the following behavior. The input circuit has
equivalent resistance R;,,, so that the input voltage v,, is given by

Rin

_ 2

Vin
The equivalent input voltage seen by the amplifier is then amplified by a constant
factor A. This is represented by the controlled voltage source Avj,. The controlled
source appears in series with an internal resistor R,,,, denoting the internal (output)
resistance of the amplifier. Thus, the voltage presented to the load is

Rr

———_. 8.3
Rout + Ry (

vy, = AVin

or, by substituting the equation for vin,

R, R
v, = (4 u £ ) a (8.4)
Rs + Rin Rout + Ri

In other words, the load voltage is an amplified version of the source voltage.

Unfortunately, the amplification factor is now dependent on both the source
and load impedances, and on the input and output resistance of the amplifier. Thus, a
given amplifier would perform differently with different loads or sources. What are
the desirable characteristics for a voltage amplifier that would make its performance
relatively independent of source and load impedances? Consider, once again, the
expression for v;,. If the input resistance of the amplifier R;,, were very large, the
source voltage vs and the input voltage v;, would be approximately equal:

Vin © Us (8.5)

Rin
lim —“"— =1 (8.6)
Rin oo Rin + Rs

By an analogous argument, it can also be seen that the desired output resistance for
the amplifier R,,, should be very small, since for an amplifier with R,.. = 0, the load
voltage would be

vp = Adin (8.7)

343

Figure 8.3 Simple voltage

Chapter 8 Operational Amplifiers

Combining these two results, we can see that as R;, approaches infinity and Rox
approaches zero, the ideal amplifier magnifies the source voltage by a factor A

vy = Avs (8.8)

just as was indicated in the “black box” amplifier of Figure 8.2.

Thus, two desirable characteristics for a general-purpose voltage amplifier are
avery large input impedance anda very small output impedance. In the next sections
we will show how operational amplifiers provide these desired characteristics.

8.2 THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER

An operational amplifier is an integrated circuit, that is, a large collection of
individual electric and electronic circuits integrated on a single silicon wafer. An
operational amplifier—or op-amp—can perform a great number of operations, such
as addition, filtering, and integration, which are all based on the properties of ideal
amplifiers and of ideal circuit elements. The introduction of the operational ampli-
fier in integrated-circuit (IC) form marked the beginning of a new era in modern
electronics. Since the introduction of the first IC op-amp, the trend in electronic
instrumentation has been to move away from the discrete (individual-component)
design of electronic circuits, toward the use of integrated circuits for a large number
of applications. This statement is particularly true for applications of the type the non—
electrical engineer is likely to encounter: op-amps are found in most measurement
and instrumentation applications, serving as extremely versatile building blocks for
any application that requires the processing of electric signals.

Next, we introduce simple circuit models of the op-amp. The simplicity of the
models will permit the use of the op-amp as a circuit element, or building block, with-
out the need to describe its internal workings in detail. Integrated-circuit technology
has today reached such an advanced stage of development that it can be safely stated
that for the purpose of many instrumentation applications, the op-amp can be treated
as an ideal device.

The Open-Loop Model

The ideal operational amplifier behaves very much as an ideal difference amplifier,
that is, a device that amplifies the difference between two input voltages. Operational
amplifiers are characterized by near-infinite input resistance and very small output
resistance. As shown in Figure 8.4, the output of the op-amp is an amplified version
of the difference between the voltages present at the two inputs:!

Vou = Avior) (vt — v) (8.9)

The input denoted by a plus sign is called the noninverting input (or terminal), while
that represented with a minus sign is termed the inverting input (or terminal). The
amplification factor, or gain, Ay or) is called the open-loop voltage gain and is quite
large by design, typically on the order of 10° to 10’; it will soon become apparent
why a large open-loop gain is a desirable characteristic. Together with the high input
resistance and low output resistance, the effect of a large amplifier open-loop voltage
gain Ayr) is such that op-amp circuits can be designed to perform very nearly as

'The amplifier of Figure 8.4 is a voltage amplifier; another type of operational amplifier, called a current
or transconductance amplifier, is described in the homework problems.

ideal voltage or current amplifiers. In effect, to analyze the performance of an op-amp
circuit, only one assumption will be needed: that the current flowing into the input
circuit of the amplifier is zero, or

iin = 0 (8.10)

This assumption is justified by the large input resistance and large open-loop gain of
the operational amplifier. The model just introduced will be used to analyze three
amplifier circuits in the next part of this section.

The Operational Amplifier in Closed-Loop Mode

The Inverting Amplifier

One of the more popular circuit configurations of the op-amp, because of its simpli-
city, is the so-called inverting amplifier, shown in Figure 8.5. The input signal to be
amplified is connected to the inverting terminal, while the noninverting terminal is
grounded. It will now be shown how it is possible to choose an (almost) arbitrary

gain for this amplifier by selecting the ratio of two resistors. The analysis is begun by
noting that at the inverting input node, KCL requires that

is tip = iin (8.11)

The current ir, which flows back to the inverting terminal from the output, is appro-
priately termed feedback current, because it represents an input to the amplifier that
is “fed back” from the output. Applying Ohm’s law, we may determine each of the
three currents shown in Figure 8.5:

. Us — U- . Vout — U— .

(the last by assumption, as stated earlier). The voltage at the noninverting input v* is
easily identified as zero, since it is directly connected to ground: vt = 0. Now, the
open-loop model for the op-amp requires that

Vou = Avior) (vt — v-) = —Aveonjv (8.13)
or

Having solved for the voltage present at the inverting input v~ in terms of Vou, we
may now compute an expression for the amplifier gain vo,./vs. This quantity is called
the closed-loop gain, because the presence of a feedback connection between the
output and the input constitutes a closed loop.* Combining equations 8.11 and 8.12,
we can write

1/(Rr/Rs). As stated earlier, typical values of Ayo) range from 10° to 107,
and thus it is reasonable to conclude that, to a close approximation, the following

?This terminology is borrowed from the field of automatic controls, for which the theory of closed-loop
feedback systems forms the foundation.

Part II Electronics

That is, the closed-loop gain of an inverting amplifier may be selected simply by the ap-
propriate choice of two externally connected resistors. The price for this
extremely simple result is an inversion of the output with respect to the input—that is, a
minus sign.

Next, we show that by making an additional assumption it is possible to simplify
the analysis considerably. Consider that, as was shown for the inverting amplifier, the
inverting terminal voltage is given by

= Vout

v Avon (8.20)
Clearly, as Ayor) approaches infinity, the inverting-terminal voltage is going to be
very small (practically, on the order of microvolts). It may then be assumed that in
the inverting amplifier, v~ is virtually zero:

v 0 (8.21)

This assumption prompts an interesting observation (which may not yet appear
obvious at this point):

The effect of the feedback connection from output to inverting input is to force
the voltage at the inverting input to be equal to that at the noninverting input.

This is equivalent to stating that for an op-amp with negative feedback,
vo xot (8.22)

The analysis of the operational amplifier can now be greatly simplified if the following
two assumptions are made:

1. i, =O Assumptions for analysis of ideal

2. v =v‘ op-amp with negative feedback (8.23)

This technique will be tested in the next subsection by analyzing a noninverting
amplifier configuration. Example 8.1 illustrates some simple design considerations.

Chapter 8

Why Feedback?

Why is such emphasis placed on the notion of an
amplifier with a very large open-loop gain and with
negative feedback? Why not just design an amplifier
with a reasonable gain, say, x10, or x 100, and just
use it as such, without using feedback connections?
In these paragraphs, we hope to answer these and
other questions, introducing the concept of negative
feedback in an intuitive fashion.

The fundamental reason for designing an
amplifier with a very large open-loop gain is the flex-
ibility it provides in the design of amplifiers with an
(almost) arbitrary gain; it has already been shown that
the gain of the inverting amplifier is determined by
the choice of two external resistors—undoubtedly a
convenient feature! Negative feedback is the mech-
anism that enables us to enjoy such flexibility in the
design of linear amplifiers.

To understand the role of feedback in the
operational amplifier, consider the internal structure
of the op-amp shownin Figure 8.4. The large open-loop
gain causes any difference in voltage at the input
terminals to appear greatly amplified at the output.
When a negative feedback connection is provided,
as shown, for example, in the inverting amplifier of
Figure 8.5, the output voltage v,,, causes a current
ir to flow through the feedback resistance so that
KCL is satisfied at the inverting node. Assume, for a
moment, that the differential voltage

Av =vt —v

is identically zero. Then the output voltage will
continue to be such that KCL is satisfied at the
inverting node, that is, such that the current ip is equal
to the current is.

EXAMPLE 8.1

Problem

Operational Amplifiers

Suppose, now, that a small imbalance in voltage
Avispresentat the inputto the op-amp. Then the output
voltage will be increased by an amount Ayo) Av.
Thus, an incremental current approximately equal
to Avior) Av/Re will flow from output to input via
the feedback resistor. The effect of this incremental
current is to reduce the voltage difference Av to zero,
so as to restore the original balance in the circuit.
One way of viewing negative feedback, then, is to
consider it a self-balancing mechanism, which allows
the amplifier to preserve zero potential difference
between its input terminals.

A practical example that illustrates a common
application of negative feedback is the thermostat.
This simple temperature control system operates
by comparing the desired ambient temperature and
the temperature measured by a thermometer and
turning a heat source on and off to maintain the
difference between actual and desired temperature
as close to zero as possible. An analogy may be
made with the inverting amplifier if we consider that,
in this case, negative feedback is used to keep the
inverting-terminal voltage as close as possible to the
noninverting-terminal voltage. The latter voltage is
analogous to the desired ambient temperature in your
home, while the former plays a role akin to that of
the actual ambient temperature. The open-loop gain
of the amplifier forces the two voltages to be close to
each other, in much the same way as the furnace raises
the heat in the house to match the desired ambient
temperature.

It is also possible to configure operational
amplifiers in a positive feedback configuration if the
output connection is tied to the noninverting input.

Inverting Amplifier Circuit

Determine the voltage gain and output voltage for the inverting amplifier circuit of Figure 8.5.
What will the uncertainty in the gain be if 5 and 10 percent tolerance resistors are used,
respectively?

and negative feedback forces vt = v7.

The Summing Amplifier

Auseful op-amp circuit that is based on the inverting amplifier is the op-amp summer,
or summing amplifier. This circuit, shown in Figure 8.7, is used to add signal sources.
The primary advantage of using the op-amp as a summer is that the summation occurs
independently of load and source impedances, so that sources with different internal
impedances will not interact with one another. The operation of the summing amplifier
is best understood by application of KCL at the inverting node: The sum of the NV
source currents and the feedback current must equal zero, so that

iy tint+---+iy = —ir (8.24)
But each of the source currents is given by

i, = — n=1,2,...,N (8.25)

while the feedback current is

Combining equations 8.25 and 8.26, and using equation 8.15, we obtain the following
result:

or

Summing amplifier (8.28)

That is, the output consists of the weighted sum of N input signal sources, with the
weighting factor for each source equal to the ratio of the feedback resistance to the
source resistance.

Part II Electronics

The Noninverting Amplifier

To avoid the negative gain (i.e., phase inversion) introduced by the inverting amplifier,
a noninverting amplifier configuration is often employed. A typical noninverting
amplifier is shown in Figure 8.8; note that the input signal is applied to the noninverting
terminal this time.

The noninverting amplifier can be analyzed in much the same way as the
inverting amplifier. Writing KCL at the inverting node yields

ip = Is + lin © is (8.29)
where
Vout — v-
ip = ————_ 8.30
IF Rp ( )

Now, since i;, = 0, the voltage drop across the source resistance R is equal to zero.
Thus,

vt = vs (8.32)
and, using equation 8.22, we get
v =v =vds (8.33)

Substituting this result in equations 8.29 and 8.30, we can easily show that

closed-loop gain

which is the closed-loop gain expression for a noninverting amplifier. Note that the
gain of this type of amplifier is always positive and greater than (or equal to) 1.

The same result could have been obtained without making the assumption that
vt =v_, at the expense of some additional work. The procedure one would follow
in this latter case is analogous to the derivation carried out earlier for the inverting
amplifier, and it is left as an exercise.

In summary, in the preceding pages it has been shown that by constructing a
nonideal amplifier with very large gain and near-infinite input resistance, it is possible
to design amplifiers that have near-ideal performance and provide a variable range
of gains, easily controlled by the selection of external resistors. The mechanism
that allows this is negative feedback. From here on, unless otherwise noted, it will

the input voltage. To compute the input resistance of this amplifier, we observe that since the

Comments: The input resistance of the voltage follower is the most important property of the
amplifier: The extremely high input resistance of this amplifier (on the order of megohms to
gigohms) permits virtually perfect isolation between source and load and eliminates loading
effects. Voltage followers, or impedance buffers, are commonly packaged in groups of four or
more in integrated-circuit form.

The Differential Amplifier

The third closed-loop model examined in this chapter is a combination of the inverting
and noninverting amplifiers; it finds frequent use in situations where the difference
between two signals needs to be amplified. The basic differential amplifier circuit is
shown in Figure 8.10, where the two sources v, and v2 may be independent of each
other or may originate from the same process.

The analysis of the differential amplifier may be approached by various methods;
the one we select to use at this stage consists of

1. Computing the noninverting- and inverting-terminal voltages vt and v~.
2. Equating the inverting and noninverting input voltages: v- = v*.
3. Applying KCL at the inverting node, where i2 = —i.

Since it has been assumed that no current flows into the amplifier, the noninverting-
terminal voltage is given by the following voltage divider:

Thus, the differential amplifier magnifies the difference between the two input signals
by the closed-loop gain R2/R.

In practice, it is often necessary to amplify the difference between two signals
that are both corrupted by noise or some other form of interference. In such cases,
the differential amplifier provides an invaluable tool in amplifying the desired signal
while rejecting the noise.

In summary, Table 8.1 provides a quick reference to the basic op-amp circuits

Unfortunately, the presence of electrical equipment powered by the 60-Hz, 110-V AC line

pick up some of the 60-Hz signal in addition to the desired EKG voltage. In effect, instead of
recording the desired EKG signals v; and v2, the two electrodes provide the following inputs
to the EKG amplifier, shown in Figure 8.13:

The interference signal V,, cos(377t + @,) is approximately the same at both leads, because
the electrodes are chosen to be identical (e.g., they have the same lead lengths) and are in
close proximity to each other. Further, the nature of the interference signal is such that it is
common to both leads, since it is a property of the environment in which the EKG instrument

Chapter 8 Operational Amplifiers

Thus, the differential amplifier nullifies the effect of the 60-Hz interference, while amplifying
the desired EKG waveform.

The differential amplifier provides the ability to reject common-mode signal
components (such as noise or undesired DC offsets) while amplifying the differential-
mode components. This is a very desirable feature in instrumentation systems. In
practice, rejection of the common-mode signal is not complete: some of the common-
mode signal component will always appear in the output. This fact gives rise to a figure
of merit called the common-mode rejection ratio, which is discussed in Section 8.6.

Often, to provide impedance isolation between bridge transducers and the
differential amplifier stage, the signals v; and v2 are amplified separately. This technique
gives rise to the instrumentation amplifier (IA), shown in Figure 8.14. Example 8.4
illustrates the calculation of the closed-loop gain for a typical instrumentation
amplifier.

is a noninverting amplifier (see Figure 8.8), and we can directly write the expression for the

Each of the two inputs v, and v2 is therefore an input to the second stage of the instrumentation

Because the instrumentation amplifier has widespread application—and in
order to ensure the best possible match between resistors—the entire circuit of
Figure 8.14 is often packaged as a single integrated circuit. The advantage of this
configuration is that resistors R; and Ry can be matched much more precisely in an
integrated circuit than would be possible by using discrete components. A typical,
commercially available integrated-circuit package is the AD625. Data sheets for this

tiometer R,. The resistors R are included in the circuit to prevent the potentiometer from being

One of the most common applications of op-amps is to serve as a building block in
analog control systems. The objective of this example is to illustrate the use of op-amps in
a temperature control circuit. Figure 8.18(a) depicts a system for which we wish to maintain
a constant temperature of 20°C in a variable temperature environment. The temperature of
the system is measured via a thermocouple. Heat can be added to the system by providing
a current to a heater coil, represented in the figure by the resistor R,o. The heat flux thus
generated is given by the quantity gj, = i7Rcoi1, Where i is the current provided by a power
amplifier and Roi is the resistance of the heater coil. The system is insulated on three sides,
and loses heat to the ambient through convective heat transfer on the fourth side [right-hand
side in Figure 18(a)]. The convective heat loss is represented by an equivalent thermal resis-
tance, R,. The system has mass m, specific heat c, and its thermal capacitance is C, = mc (see

thatis, ve = Vyef—Vtemp = O(Trep — T). With reference to the block diagram of Figure 8.18(b), we
see that to maintain the temperature of the system at the desired level, we can use the difference
voltage v, as an input to the power amplifier [the controlled current source of Figure 8.18(a)].
You should easily convince yourself that a positive v, corresponds to the need for heating
the system, since a positive v. corresponds to a system temperature lower than the reference
temperature. Next, the power amplifier can output a positive current for a positive v,. Thus,
the block diagram shown in Figure 8.18(b) corresponds to an automatic control system that
automatically increases or decreases the heater coil current to maintain the system temperature
at the desired (reference) value. The “Amplifier” block in Figure 8.18(b) gives us the freedom
to decide how much to increase the power amplifier output current to provide the necessary
heating. The proportional gain of the amplifier, Kp, is a design parameter of the circuit that
allows the user to optimize the response of the system for a specific design requirement. For
example, a system specification could require that the automatic temperature control system
be designed so as to maintain the temperature to within 1 degree of the reference temperature
for external temperature disturbances as large as 10 degrees. As you shall see, we can adjust
the response of the system by varying the proportional gain.

The objective of this example is to show how operational amplifiers can be used to pro-
vide two of the functions illustrated in the block diagram of Figure 8.18(b): (1) the summing
amplifier computes the difference between the reference temperature and the system tempera-
ture; and (2) an inverting amplifier implements the proportional gain function that allows the
designer to select the response of the amplifier by choosing an appropriate proportional gain.

Figure 8.18(c) depicts the two-stage op-amp circuit that performs these functions. The first
element is an inverting amplifier with unity gain, with the function of changing the sign of yer.
The second amplifier, and inverting summing amplifier, adds Vjemp tO —Uyer and inverts the sum
of these two signals, while at the same time amplifying it by the gain R2/R,. Thus, the output
of the circuit of Figure 8.18(c) consists of the quantity R2/Rj (Vref — Viemp) = Kp (Vref — Viemp)-
In other words, selection of the feedback resistor Ry is equivalent to choosing the gain Kp.

To analyze the response of the system for various values of Kp, we must first under-
stand how the system responds in the absence of automatic control. The differential equation

Thus, the thermal system is a first-order system, and its time constant is T = R,C, = 2°C/W
x 50 J/°C = 100 s. The inputs to the system are the ambient temperature, T,,, and the heat
flux, gin, which is proportional to the square of the heater coil current. Imagine now that
the thermal system is suddenly exposed to a 10-degree change in ambient temperature (for
example, a drop from 20°C to 10°C). Figure 8.18(d) depicts the response of the system for
various values of Kp. Kp = 0 corresponds to the case of no automatic control—that is, the open
loop response of the system. In this case, we can clearly see that the temperature of the system
drops exponentially from 20 to 10 degrees with a time constant of 100 s. This is so because no
heating is provided from the power amplifier. As the gain Kp is increased to 1, the difference
or “error” voltage, v,, increases as soon as the temperature drops below the reference value.
Since a = 1, the voltage is numerically equal to the temperature difference. Figure 8.18(d)
shows the temperature response for values of Kp ranging from 1 to 50. You can see that as the
gain increases, the error between the desired and actual temperatures decreases very quickly.
In particular, the error becomes less than 1 degree, which is the intended specification, for
Kp = 5 (in fact, we could probably achieve the specification with a gain slightly less than 5).
To better understand the inner workings of the automatic temperature control system, it is also
helpful to look at the error voltage, which is amplified to provide the power amplifier output
current. With reference to Figure 8.18(e), we can see that when Kp = 1, the current increases
somewhat slowly to a final value of about 2.7 A; as the gain is increased to 5 and 10, the current
response increases more rapidly, and eventually settles to values of 3 and 3.1 A, respectively.
The steady-state value of the current is reached in about 20 s for Kp = 5, and in about 10s
for Kp = 10.

Comments: Please note that even though the response of the system is satisfactory, the
temperature error is not zero. That is, the automatic control system has a steady-state error.
The design specifications recognized this fact by specifying that a 1°C tolerance was sufficient.

Practical Op-Amp Design Considerations ( LO2

The results presented in the preceding pages
suggest that operational amplifiers permit the
design of a rather sophisticated circuit in a few very
simple steps, simply by selecting appropriate resistor
values. This is certainly true, provided that the circuit
component selection satisfies certain criteria. Here we
summarize some important practical design criteria
that the designer should keep in mind when selecting
component values for op-amp circuits. Section 8.6
explores the practical limitations of op-amps in greater
detail.

1. Use standard resistor values. While any arbitrary
value of gain can, in principle, be achieved by
selecting the appropriate combination of resis-
tors, the designer is often constrained to the
use of standard 5 percent resistor values (see
Table 2.1). For example, if your design requires
a gain of 25, you might be tempted to select, say,
100- and 4-kQ resistors to achieve Rr /Rs = 25.
However, inspection of Table 2.1 reveals that
4 kQ is not a standard value; the closest 5 per-
cent tolerance resistor value is 3.9 kQ, leading to
a gain of 25.64. Can you find a combination of
standard 5 percent resistors whose ratio is closer
to 25?

Ensure that the load current is reasonable
(do not select very small resistor values).
Consider the same example given in step 1.
Suppose that the maximum output voltage is
10 V. The feedback current required by your
design with Rr = 100kQ and Rs =4kQ
would be Jr = 10/100,000 = 0.1 mA. This is a

very reasonable value for an op-amp, as
explained in section 8.6. If you tried to achieve
the same gain by using, say, a 10-Q2 feedback
resistor and a 0.39-Q source resistor, the feed-
back current would become as large as 1 A.
This is a value that is generally beyond the ca-
pabilities of a general-purpose op-amp, so the
selection of exceedingly low resistor values is
not acceptable. On the other hand, the selection
of 10-kQ and 390-Q resistors would still lead
to acceptable values of current, and would be
equally good. As a general rule of thumb, you
should avoid resistor values lower than 100 Q
in practical designs.
Avoidstraycapacitance(donotselectexcessively
large resistor values). The use of exceedingly
large resistor values can cause unwanted signals
to couple into the circuit through a mechanism
known as capacitive coupling. Large resistance
values can also cause other problems. As a
general rule of thumb, avoid resistor values
higher than 1 M2 in practical designs.
Precision designs may be warranted. If a
certain design requires that the amplifier gain
be set to a very accurate value, it may be
appropriate to use the (more expensive) option
of precision resistors: for example, 1 percent
tolerance resistors are commonly available, at a
premium cost. Some of the examples and home-
work problems explore the variability in gain
due to the use of higher- and lower-tolerance
resistors.

USING OP-AMP DATA SHEETS oe

Here we illustrate use of device data sheets for two commonly used operational amplifiers. The a
first, the LM741, is a general-purpose (low-cost) amplifier; the second, the LMC6061, is a pre-
cision CMOS high-input-impedance single-supply amplifier. Excerpts from the data sheets are
shown below, with some words of explanation. Later in this chapter we compare the electrical ONTIBEMES,
characteristics of these two op-amps in greater detail.

LM741 General Description and Connection Diagrams—tThis sheet summarizes the general characteristics
of the op-amp. The connection diagrams are shown. Note that the op-amp is available in various packages:
a metal can package, a dual-in-line package (DIP), and two ceramic dual-in-line options. The dual-in-line (or
S.O.) package is the one you are most likely to see in a laboratory. Note that in this configuration the integrated
circuit has eight connections, or pins: two for the voltage supplies (Vt and V~); two inputs (inverting and
noninverting); one output; two offset null connections (to be discussed later in the chapter); and a no-connection
(NC) pin.

LM741 Operational Amplifier

General Description

The LM741 series are general-purpose operational amplifiers which feature improved performance over
industry standards like the LM709. They are direct, plug-in replacements for the 709C, LM201, MC1439,
and 748 in most applications.

The amplifiers offer many features which make their application nearly foolproof: overload protection
on the input and output, no latch-up when the common-mode range is exceeded, as well as freedom from
oscillations.

The LM741C and LM741E are identical to the LM741 and LM741A except that the LM741C and
LM741E have their performance guaranteed over a 0 to +70°C temperature range, instead of
—55 to +125°C.

LMC6061 General Description and Connection Diagrams—tThe description and diagram below reveal
several similarities between the 741 and 6061 op-amps, but also some differences. The 6061 uses more
advanced technology and is characterized by some very desirable features (e.g., the very low power consump-
tion of CMOS circuits results in typical supply currents of only 20 A!). You can also see from the connection
diagram that pins | and 5 (used for offset null connections in the 741) are not used in this IC. We return to this
point later in the chapter.

LMC6061 Precision CMOS Single Micropower Operational Amplifier

General Description

The LMC6061 is a precision single low offset voltage, micropower operational amplifier, capable of precision
single-supply operation. Performance characteristics include ultralow input bias current, high voltage gain,
rail-to-rail output swing, and an input common-mode voltage range that includes ground. These features, plus
its low power consumption, make the LMC6061 ideally suited for battery-powered applications.

Other applications using the LMC6061 include precision full-wave rectifiers, integrators, references,
sample-and-hold circuits, and true instrumentation amplifiers.

This device is built with National’s advanced double-poly silicon-gate CMOS process. For designs that
require higher speed, see the LMC6081 precision single operational amplifier. For a dual or quad operational
amplifier with similar features, see the LMC6062 or LMC6064, respectively.

8.3 ACTIVE FILTERS

The range of useful applications of an operational amplifier is greatly expanded if
energy storage elements are introduced into the design; the frequency-dependent
properties of these elements, studied in Chapters 4 and 6, will prove useful in the
design of various types of op-amp circuits. In particular, it will be shown that it is
possible to shape the frequency response of an operational amplifier by appropriate
use of complex impedances in the input and feedback circuits. The class of filters one
can obtain by means of op-amp designs is called active filters, because op-amps can
provide amplification (gain) in addition to the filtering effects already studied in
Chapter 6 for passive circuits (i.e., circuits comprising exclusively resistors, capaci-
tors, and inductors).

The easiest way to see how the frequency response of an op-amp can be shaped
(almost) arbitrarily is to replace the resistors Rr and Rs in Figures 8.5 and 8.8 with
impedances Zr and Zs, as shown in Figure 8.19. It is a straightforward matter to show
that in the case of the inverting amplifier, the expression for the closed-loop gain is
given by

Vout : ZF
— 7 8.45
V; (jo) Z, (8.45)
whereas for the noninverting case, the gain is
Vout : Zr
=l+—> 8.46
Vs; (jo) Z, (8.46)

where Zp and Zs can be arbitrarily complex impedance functions and where Vs, Vou,
I-, and Is are all phasors. Thus, it is possible to shape the frequency response of
an ideal op-amp filter simply by selecting suitable ratios of feedback impedance to
source impedance. By connecting a circuit similar to the low-pass filters studied in
Chapter 6 in the feedback loop of an op-amp, the same filtering effect can be achieved
and, in addition, the signal can be amplified.

The simplest op-amp low-pass filter is shown in Figure 8.20. Its analysis is
quite simple if we take advantage of the fact that the closed-loop gain, as a function
of frequency, is given by

Zr

Ap(j@) = "Zs (8.47)

Part II Electronics

where
1 R
Zp = Rr || —- =——*
jJoCr 1+ joCrRr

(8.48)

and
Zs = Rs (8.49)

Note the similarity between Zp and the low-pass characteristic of the passive RC

circuit! The closed-loop gain A;p(j@) is then computed to be

Zr Rr/Rs

Ayp(jw) = Low-pass filter (8.50)
This expression can be factored into two parts. The first is an amplification factor
analogous to the amplification that would be obtained with a simple inverting amplifier
(i.e., the same circuit as that of Figure 8.20 with the capacitor removed); the second
is a low-pass filter, with a cutoff frequency dictated by the parallel combination of
Rr and Cf in the feedback loop. The filtering effect is completely analogous to what
would be attained by the passive circuit shown in Figure 8.21. However, the op-amp
filter also provides amplification by a factor of Rr/Rs.

It should be apparent that the response of this op-amp filter is just an Amplified
version of that of the passive filter. Figure 8.22 depicts the amplitude response of the
active low-pass filter (in the figure, Rr/Rs = 10 and 1/R-Cr = 1) in two different
graphs; the first plots the amplitude ratio Vou.(j@) versus radian frequency w on a
logarithmic scale, while the second plots the amplitude ratio 20 log Vs (ja) (in units
of decibels), also versus w on a logarithmic scale. You will recall from Chapter 6
that decibel frequency response plots are encountered very frequently. Note that in
the decibel plot, the slope of the filter response for frequencies is significantly higher
than the cutoff frequency,

Thus, w is also called the 3-dB frequency.

Among the advantages of such active low-pass filters is the ease with which the
gain and the bandwidth can be adjusted by controlling the ratios Rr /Rs and 1/RrCr,
respectively.

It is also possible to construct other types of filters by suitably connecting
resistors and energy storage elements to an op-amp. For example, a high-pass active
filter can easily be obtained by using the circuit shown in Figure 8.23. Observe that
the impedance of the input circuit is

and that of the feedback circuit is
Zr = Rr (8.55)

As @ approaches zero, so does the response of the filter, whereas as w approaches
infinity, according to the gain expression of equation 8.56, the gain of the amplifier
approaches a constant:
lim Ayp(jo) = _Rr (8.57)
o> oo Rs
That is, above a certain frequency range, the circuit acts as a linear amplifier. This is
exactly the behavior one would expect of a high-pass filter. The high-pass response
is depicted in Figure 8.24, in both linear and decibel plots (in the figure, Rr /Rs = 10
and 1/RsC = 1). Note that in the decibel plot, the slope of the filter response for
frequencies significantly lower than m = 1/RsCs = 1 is +20 dB/decade, while the
slope for frequencies significantly higher than this cutoff (or 3-dB) frequency is equal
to zero.

As a final example of active filters, let us look at a simple active bandpass
filter configuration. This type of response may be realized simply by combining the
high- and low-pass filters we examined earlier. The circuit is shown in Figure 8.25.

examples. First we evaluate the feedback and input impedances:

The form of the op-amp response we just obtained should not be a surprise. It is very
similar (although not identical) to the product of the low-pass and high-pass responses
of equations 8.50 and 8.56. In particular, the denominator of Agp(j@) is exactly the
product of the denominators of Ajp(j@) and Ayp( jw). It is particularly enlightening
to rewrite A; p( jm) ina slightly different form, after making the observation that each
RC product corresponds to some “critical” frequency:

It is easy to verify that for the case where

the response of the op-amp filter may be represented as shown in Figure 8.26
in both linear and decibel plots (in the figure, w; = 1, ap = 1,000, and
@yp = 10). The decibel plot is very revealing, for it shows that, in effect, the
bandpass response is the graphical superposition of the low-pass and high-pass
responses shown earlier. The two 3-dB (or cutoff) frequencies are the same as in
A,p(j@), 1/RrCr; and in Ayp(jm), 1/RsCs. The third frequency, m, = 1/RrCs,
represents the point where the response of the filter crosses the 0-dB axis (rising
slope). Since 0 dB corresponds to a gain of 1, this frequency is called the unity gain
frequency.

The ideas developed thus far can be employed to construct more complex
functions of frequency. In fact, most active filters one encounters in practical

370

Chapter 8 Operational Amplifiers

applications are based on circuits involving more than one or two energy storage
elements. By constructing suitable functions for Zr and Zs, it is possible to realize
filters with greater frequency selectivity (i.e., sharpness of cutoff), as well as flatter
bandpass or band-rejection functions (i.e., filters that either allow or reject signals
in a limited band of frequencies). A few simple applications are investigated in the
homework problems. One remark that should be made in passing, though, pertains to
the exclusive use of capacitors in the circuits analyzed thus far. One of the advantages
of op-amp filters is that it is not necessary to use both capacitors and inductors to
obtain a bandpass response. Suitable connections of capacitors can accomplish that
task in an op-amp. This seemingly minor fact is of great importance in practice,
because inductors are expensive to mass-produce to close tolerances and exact
specifications and are often bulkier than capacitors with equivalent energy storage
capabilities. On the other hand, capacitors are easy to manufacture in a wide variety
of tolerances and values, and in relatively compact packages, including in integrated-
circuit form.

Example 8.7 illustrates how it is possible to construct active filters with greater
frequency selectivity by adding energy storage elements to the design.

Comments: Note the similarity between the expression for the gain of the filter of Figure 8.27
and that given in equation 8.50 for the gain of a (first-order) low-pass filter. Clearly, the circuit
analyzed in this example is also a low-pass filter, of second order (as the quadratic denominator
term suggests). Figure 8.28 compares the two responses in both linear and decibel (Bode)
magnitude plots. The slope of the decibel plot for the second-order filter at higher frequencies
is twice that of the first-order filter (—40 versus —20 dB/decade). We should also remark that
the use of an inductor in the filter design is not recommended in practice, as explained in
the above section, and that we have used it in this example only because of the simplicity
of the resulting gain expressions.

8.4 INTEGRATOR AND DIFFERENTIATOR
CIRCUITS

In the preceding sections, we examined the frequency response of op-amp circuits
for sinusoidal inputs. However, certain op-amp circuits containing energy storage
elements reveal some of their more general properties if we analyze their response
to inputs that are time-varying but not necessarily sinusoidal. Among such circuits
are the commonly used integrator and differentiator; the analysis of these circuits is
presented in the following paragraphs.

The Ideal Integrator

Consider the circuit of Figure 8.29, where vs (f) is an arbitrary function of time (e.g., a
pulse train, a triangular wave, or a square wave). The op-amp circuit shown provides
an output that is proportional to the integral of vs(t). The analysis of the integrator
circuit is, as always, based on the observation that

is(t) = —ir(t) (8.63)
where
; Us (t)
=. .64
is(t) Rs (8.64)
It is also known that
= ——— .65
ip(t) = Cr Ht (8.65)

from the fundamental definition of the capacitor. The source voltage can then be
expressed as a function of the derivative of the output voltage:

Vout (t)
j=-- 8.66
RsC; Us (t) Tt (8.66)
By integrating both sides of equation 8.66, we obtain the following result:
t
Vou(t) = — / vs (t’) dt’ Op-amp integrator (8.67)
Rs Cr —0oo

This equation states that the output voltage is the integral of the input voltage.

There are numerous applications of the op-amp integrator, most notably the
analog computer, which is discussed in Section 8.5. Example 8.8 illustrates the
operation of the op-amp integrator.

Figure 8.30

EXAMPLE 8.8 Integrating a Square Wave

Problem

Determine the output voltage for the integrator circuit of Figure 8.30 if the input is a square
wave of amplitude +A and period T.

Solution

Known Quantities: Feedback and source impedances; input waveform characteristics.

Part II Electronics

Find: vou(t).

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: T = 10 ms; Cr = 1| uF;
Rs = 10kQ.

Assumptions: Assume an ideal op-amp. The square wave starts at tf = 0, and therefore

Analysis: Following equation 8.67, we write the expression for the output of the integrator:

1 ‘ / / 1 ° I / ‘ J J
Vour(t) = — C / us (t') dt ="RC '/ vs (t) dt +f ws(tydr |
FYS J—oo FYS —0o 0

Next, we note that we can integrate the square wave in a piecewise fashion by observing that
us(t) =A for 0 < t < T/2 and vs(t) = —A for T/2 < t < T. We consider the first half of the
waveform:

Since the waveform is periodic, the above result will repeat with period T, as shown in
Figure 8.31. Note also that the average value of the output voltage is not zero.

Comments: The integral of a square wave is thus a triangular wave. This is a useful fact to
remember. Note that the effect of the initial condition is very important, since it determines the
starting point of the triangular wave.

8.5 PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS OF OPERATIONAL
AMPLIFIERS

Thus far, the operational amplifier has been treated as an ideal device, characterized
by infinite input resistance, zero output resistance, and infinite open-loop voltage
gain. Although this model is adequate to represent the behavior of the op-amp in a
large number of applications, practical operational amplifiers are not ideal devices
but exhibit a number of limitations that should be considered in the design of
instrumentation. In particular, in dealing with relatively large voltages and currents,
and in the presence of high-frequency signals, it is important to be aware of the
nonideal properties of the op-amp. In this section, we examine the principal limitations
of the operational amplifier.

Voltage Supply Limits

As indicated in Figure 8.4, operational amplifiers (and all amplifiers, in general) are
powered by external DC voltage supplies vs and V;, which are usually symmetric
and on the order of £10 to £20 V. Some op-amps are especially designed to operate
from a single voltage supply; but for the sake of simplicity from here on we shall
consider only symmetric supplies. The effect of limiting supply voltages is that ampli-
fiers are capable of amplifying signals only within the range of their supply voltages;
it would be physically impossible for an amplifier to generate a voltage greater than
ve or less than V, . This limitation may be stated as follows:

Vs < Vow < vs Voltage supply limitation (8.71)


Part II Electronics 375

For most op-amps, the limit is actually approximately 1.5 V less than the supply
voltages. How does this practically affect the performance of an amplifier circuit? An
example will best illustrate the idea.

EXAMPLE 8.9 Voltage Supply Limits in an Inverting Amplifier

Problem ( LO4

Compute and sketch the output voltage of the inverting amplifier of Figure 8.33.

Solution
Known Quantities: Resistor and supply voltage values; input voltage.
Find: voy (ft).

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: Rs = 1 kQ; Rr = 10 kQ;
Rp, =1kQ; Vs =15V; V5 = —15 V; us(4) = 2 sin(1,000r).

Assumptions: Assume a supply voltage—limited op-amp. Figure 8.33

Analysis: For an ideal op-amp the output would be
R
Vour(t) = — Fost) = —10 x 2sin(1,000r) = —20 sin(1,000r)
Ss

However, the supply voltage is limited to +15 V, and the op-amp output voltage will therefore
saturate before reaching the theoretical peak output value of +20 V. Figure 8.34 depicts the
output voltage waveform.

Figure 8.34 Op-amp output with voltage supply limit

Comments: In a practical op-amp, saturation would be reached at 1.5 V below the supply
voltages, or at approximately +13.5 V.

Note how the voltage supply limit actually causes the peaks of the sine wave
to be clipped in an abrupt fashion. This type of hard nonlinearity changes the charac-
teristics of the signal quite radically, and could lead to significant errors if not taken
into account. Just to give an intuitive idea of how such clipping can affect a signal,

376

Chapter 8 Operational Amplifiers

have you ever wondered why rock guitar has a characteristic sound that is very dif-
ferent from the sound of classical or jazz guitar? The reason is that the “rock sound”
is obtained by overamplifying the signal, attempting to exceed the voltage supply
limits, and causing clipping similar in quality to the distortion introduced by voltage
supply limits in an op-amp. This clipping broadens the spectral content of each tone
and causes the sound to be distorted.

One of the circuits most directly affected by supply voltage limitations is the
op-amp integrator. Example 8.10 illustrates how saturation of an integrator circuit
can lead to severe signal distortion.

Known Quantities: Resistor, capacitor, and supply voltage values; input voltage.

Assumptions: Assume a supply voltage—limited op-amp. The initial condition is Uou:(0) = 0.

—cO

Rs Cr
= —2.5t + 1.5 sin(10f)

However, the supply voltage is limited to +15 V, and the integrator output voltage will therefore
saturate at the lower supply voltage value of —15 V as the term 2.5t increases with time.
Figure 8.36 depicts the output voltage waveform.

Comments: Note that the DC offset in the waveform causes the integrator output voltage to
increase linearly with time. The presence of even a very small DC offset will always cause
integrator saturation. One solution to this problem is to include a large feedback resistor in
parallel with the capacitor; this solution is explored in the homework problems.

Frequency Response Limits

Another property of all amplifiers that may pose severe limitations to the op-amp is
their finite bandwidth. We have so far assumed, in our ideal op-amp model, that the
open-loop gain is a very large constant. In reality, Ay(or) is a function of frequency

and is characterized by a low-pass response. For a typical op-amp, tio 4

The cutoff frequency of the op-amp open-loop gain wo represents approximately
the point where the amplifier response starts to drop off as a function of frequency,
and is analogous to the cutoff frequencies of the RC and RL circuits of Chapter 6.
Figure 8.37 depicts Ay(or)(j@) in both linear and decibel plots for the fairly typi-
cal values Ag = 10° and w) = 10z. It should be apparent from Figure 8.37 that
the assumption of a very large open-loop gain becomes less and less accurate for
increasing frequency. Recall the initial derivation of the closed-loop gain for the
inverting amplifier: In obtaining the final result Vou/Vs = —Rr/Rs, it was assumed
that Ay(oL) > oo. This assumption is clearly inadequate at the higher frequencies.

Figure 8.37 Open-loop gain of practical op-amp

The finite bandwidth of the practical op-amp results in a fixed gain-bandwidth
product for any given amplifier. The effect of a constant gain-bandwidth product
is that as the closed-loop gain of the amplifier is increased, its 3-dB bandwidth is lAvlap
proportionally reduced until, in the limit, if the amplifier were used in the open-loop
mode, its gain would be equal to Ag and its 3-dB bandwidth would be equal to @.The °° 1° 40
constant gain-bandwidth product is therefore equal to the product of the open-loop 20 Jog A, oN
gain and the open-loop bandwidth of the amplifier: Agwo = K. When the amplifier is
connected in a closed-loop configuration (e.g., as an inverting amplifier), its gain is
typically much less than the open-loop gain and the 3-dB bandwidth of the amplifier is
proportionally increased. To explain this further, Figure 8.38 depicts the case in which M O % @
two different linear amplifiers (achieved through any two different negative feedback Log scale
configurations) have been designed for the same op-amp. The first has closed-loop Figure 8.38
gain Aj, and the second has closed-loop gain Az. The bold line in the figure indicates
the open-loop frequency response, with gain Ag and cutoff frequency wo. As the gain
decreases from the open-loop gain Ag, to A;, we see that the cutoff frequency increases
from @ to @,. If we further reduce the gain to Az, we can expect the bandwidth to
increase to w2. Thus,

Chapter 8 Operational Amplifiers

The product of gain and bandwidth in any given op-amp is constant. That is,

Ao X @ = A, X @| = A2 X @2 = K (8.73)

EXAMPLE 8.11 Gain-Bandwidth Product Limit in an Op-Amp

Problem

Determine the maximum allowable closed-loop voltage gain of an op-amp if the amplifier is
required to have an audio-range bandwidth of 20 kHz.

Solution

Known Quantities: Gain-bandwidth product.

Find: Ay max.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: Ay = 10°; w) = 2m x 5 rad/s.
Assumptions: Assume a gain-bandwidth product limited op-amp.

Analysis: The gain-bandwidth product of the op-amp is

Ay X @) = K = 10° x 2x x 5=77 x 10’ rad/s

The desired bandwidth is @max = 27% x 20,000 rad/s, and the maximum allowable gain will
therefore be
K mz x 10’ V

= = 250
Omx mx4x 104 V

Amax =

For any closed-loop voltage gain greater than 250, the amplifier would have reduced bandwidth.

Comments: If we desired to achieve gains greater than 250 and maintain the same bandwidth,
two options would be available: (1) Use a different op-amp with greater gain-bandwidth prod-
uct, or (2) connect two amplifiers in cascade, each with lower gain and greater bandwidth, such
that the product of the gains would be greater than 250.

To further explore the first option, you may wish to look at the device data sheets for
different op-amps and verify that op-amps can be designed (at a cost!) to have substantially
greater gain-bandwidth product than the amplifier used in this example. The second option is
examined in Example 8.12.

In Example 8.12, we implicitly assumed that the gain of each amplifier was constant for
frequencies up to the cutoff frequency. This is, in practice, not true, since the individual

Input Offset Voltage

Another limitation of practical op-amps results because even in the absence of any
external inputs, it is possible that an offset voltage will be present at the input of an
op-amp. This voltage is usually denoted by +V,,, and it is caused by mismatches in
the internal circuitry of the op-amp. The offset voltage appears as a differential input
voltage between the inverting and noninverting input terminals. The presence of an
additional input voltage will cause a DC bias error in the amplifier output, as illustrated
in Example 8.13. Typical and maximum values of V,, are quoted in manufacturers’
data sheets. The worst-case effects due to the presence of offset voltages can therefore
be predicted for any given application.

Avnom = 100 = 1
Vn TR,

The DC offset voltage, represented by an ideal voltage source, is represented as being directly
applied to the noninverting input; thus

Thus, we should expect the output of the amplifier to be shifted upward by 150 mV.

Comments: The input offset voltage is not, of course, an external source, but it represents a
voltage offset between the inputs of the op-amp. Figure 8.43 depicts how such an offset can be
zeroed.

The worst-case offset voltage is usually listed in the device data sheets (see the data
sheets on the website for an illustration). Typical values are 2 mV for the 741c general-
purpose op-amp and 5 mV for the FET-input TLO81.

Input Bias Currents

Another nonideal characteristic of op-amps results from the presence of small
input bias currents at the inverting and noninverting terminals. Once again, these
are due to the internal construction of the input stage of an operational amplifier.
Figure 8.41 illustrates the presence of nonzero input bias currents Jg going into
an op-amp.

Typical values of Ig depend on the semiconductor technology employed in the
construction of the op-amp. Op-amps with bipolar transistor input stages may see
input bias currents as large as 1 wA, while for FET input devices, the input bias
currents are less than | nA. Since these currents depend on the internal design of the
op-amp, they are not necessarily equal. Figure 8.41

Comments: Usually, the worst-case input offset currents (or input bias currents) are listed
in the device data sheets. Values can range from 100 pA (for CMOS op-amps, for example,
LMC6061) to around 200 nA for a low-cost general-purpose amplifier (for example, ~A741c).

Output Offset Adjustment

Both the offset voltage and the input offset current contribute to an output offset
voltage Vou,.;- Some op-amps provide a means for minimizing V,,,,.,. For example,
the A741 op-amp provides a connection for this procedure. Figure 8.43 shows a
typical pin configuration for an op-amp in an eight-pin dual-in-line package (DIP)
and the circuit used for nulling the output offset voltage. The variable resistor is
adjusted until voy: reaches a minimum (ideally, 0 V). Nulling the output voltage in this
manner removes the effect of both input offset voltage and current on the output.

Slew Rate Limit

Another important restriction in the performance of a practical op-amp is associated
with rapid changes in voltage. The op-amp can produce only a finite rate of change at
its output. This limit rate is called the slew rate. Consider an ideal step input, where
at t = 0 the input voltage is switched from 0 to V volts. Then we would expect the
output to switch from 0 to AV volts, where A is the amplifier gain. However, vou(t)
can change at only a finite rate; thus,

Part II Electronics

at = So Slew rate limitation (8.75)

| d Vout (t)

Figure 8.44 shows the response of an op-amp to an ideal step change in input voltage.
Here, So, the slope of vou.(t), represents the slew rate.

The slew rate limitation can affect sinusoidal signals, as well as signals that
display abrupt changes, as does the step voltage of Figure 8.44. This may not be
obvious until we examine the sinusoidal response more closely. It should be apparent
that the maximum rate of change for a sinusoid occurs at the zero crossing, as shown
by Figure 8.45. To evaluate the slope of the waveform at the zero crossing, let

v(t) = Asinot (8.76)
so that
“ = wAcos ot (8.77)

The maximum slope of the sinusoidal signal will therefore occur at ot = 0,7,277,...,
so that

Thus, the maximum slope of a sinusoid is proportional to both the signal frequency
and the amplitude. The curve shown by a dashed line in Figure 8.45 should indicate
that as w increases, so does the slope of u(t) at the zero crossings. What is the direct
consequence of this result, then? Example 8.15 gives an illustration of the effects of
this slew rate limit.

Comments: Note that in this example the slew rate limit has been exceeded severely, and the

one needs to pay attention to the specifications of a given op-amp. The slew rate limit is listed
in the device data sheets. Typical values can range from 13 V/s, for the TLO81, to around
0.5 V/s for a low-cost general-purpose amplifier (for example, ~A741c).

Short-Circuit Output Current

Recall the model for the op-amp introduced in Section 8.2, which represented the
internal circuits of the op-amp in terms of an equivalent input resistance R;, and a

controlled voltage source Ay vj. In practice, the internal source is not ideal, because it
cannot provide an infinite amount of current (to the load, to the feedback connection,
or to both). The immediate consequence of this nonideal op-amp characteristic is that
the maximum output current of the amplifier is limited by the so-called short-circuit
output current Isc:

To further explain this point, consider that the op-amp needs to provide current to the
feedback path (in order to “zero” the voltage differential at the input) and to whatever
load resistance, Rx, may be connected to the output. Figure 8.47 illustrates this idea
for the case of an inverting amplifier, where Jsc is the load current that would be

Find: Compute the maximum allowable load resistance value Ry min, and sketch the theoretical
and actual output voltage waveforms for resistances smaller than R7 min-

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: Isc = 50 mA; vs(t) = 0.05 sin(wt);
Ay = 100.

Assumptions: Assume a short-circuit current—limited (otherwise ideal) op-amp.

Analysis: Given the closed-loop voltage gain of 100, we compute the theoretical output voltage
to be

Vou(t) = —Ayvs(t) = —5 sin(wt)

To assess the effect of the short-circuit current limit, we calculate the peak value of the output
voltage, since this is the condition that will require the maximum output current from the
op-amp:

Vout peak = 5V

R= Vout peak _ 5 Vv = 1002
fmin Isc 50 mA

Chapter 8 Operational Amplifiers

For any load resistance less than 100 , the required load current will be greater than Jsc. For
example, if we chose a 75-Q load resistor, we would find that

Vout peak = Isc x Rr = 3.75 V

That is, the output voltage cannot reach the theoretically correct 5-V peak, and would be
“compressed” to reach a peak voltage of only 3.75 V. This effect is depicted in Figure 8.48.

Comments: The short-circuit current limit is listed in the device data sheets. Typical values
for a low-cost general-purpose amplifier (say, the 741c) are in the tens of milliamperes.

Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)

If we define Ay,, as the differential-mode gain and A,,, as the common-mode gain
of the op-amp, the output of an op-amp can then be expressed as follows:

5) (8.80)

Vv Uv
Vout = Aam(v2 ~~ v1) + Am ( 2 ')

Under ideal conditions, A,,, should be exactly zero, since the differential ampli-
fier should completely reject common-mode signals. The departure from this ideal
condition is a figure of merit for a differential amplifier and is measured by defining a
quantity called the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The CMRR is defined
as the ratio of the differential-mode gain to the common-mode gain and should ideally
be infinite:

Aa

CMRR = A. Common-mode rejection ratio

cm

The CMRR is often expressed in units of decibels (dB). The common-mode rejection
ratio idea is explored further in the problems at the end of the chapter.

the 741.

Input offset voltage adjustments—The recommended circuit is shown for the 741, and a range of
+15 mV is given. The 6061 does not require offset voltage adjustment.

Input offset current—The 741 sheet reports a typical value of 3 nA (3 x 10~° A); the corresponding value for
the 6061 is 0.005 pA (5 x 107!° A)! This extremely low value is due to the MOS construction of the amplifier.

(Concluded)

Input resistance—The specifications related to input offset current are mirrored by the input resistance speci-
fications. The 741 has a respectable typical input resistance of 6 MQ; the 6061 has an input resistance greater
than 10 TQ (1 teraohm = 10!? Q). Once again, this is the result of MOS construction.
Large-signal voltage gain—The 741 lists a typical value of 50 V/mV (or 5 x 10*) for its open-loop voltage
gain; the 6061 lists values greater than or equal to 2,000 V/mV (or 2 x 10°).
CMRR-—The typical common-mode rejection ratio is 95 dB for the 741 and 85 dB for the 6061.
Slew rate—0.7 V/s for the 741 and 35 V/ms for the 6061.
Bandwidth—The bandwidth for the 741 is listed as 1.5 MHz (this would be the unity gain bandwidth), while
the 6061 lists a 100-kHz gain-bandwidth product.
Output short-circuit current—25 mA for both devices.
Note that while the LMC6061 is certainly superior to the LM741 op-amp in a number of categories, there are
certain features (e.g., bandwidth and slew rate) that might cause a designer to prefer the 741 for a specific
application.

Manufacturers generally supply values for the parameters discussed in this section in their device data
specifications. Typical data sheets for common op-amps may be found on the website.

Conclusion

Operational amplifiers constitute the single most important building block in analog electronics.
The contents of this chapter will be frequently referenced in later sections of this book. Upon
completing this chapter, you should have mastered the following learning objectives:

1.

Understand the properties of ideal amplifiers and the concepts of gain, input impedance,
and output impedance. Ideal amplifiers represent fundamental building blocks of
electronic instrumentation. With the concept of an ideal amplifier clearly established, one
can design practical amplifiers, filters, integrators, and many other signal processing
circuits. A practical op-amp closely approximates the characteristics of ideal

amplifiers.

Understand the difference between open-loop and closed-loop op-amp configuration;
and compute the gain (or complete the design of) simple inverting, noninverting,
summing, and differential amplifiers using ideal op-amp analysis. Analyze more
advanced op-amp circuits, using ideal op-amp analysis, and identify important
performance parameters in op-amp data sheets. Analysis of op-amp circuits is made
easy by a few simplifying assumptions, which are based on the op-amp having a very
large input resistance, a very small output resistance, and a large open-loop gain. The
simple inverting and noninverting amplifier configurations permit the design of very
useful circuits simply by appropriately selecting and placing a few

resistors.

Analyze and design simple active filters. The use of capacitors in op-amp circuits extends
the applications of this useful element to include filtering.

Understand the principal physical limitations of an op-amp. It is important to understand
that there are limitations in the performance of op-amp circuits that are not predicted by
the simple op-amp models presented in the early sections of the chapter. In practical
designs, issues related to voltage supply limits, bandwidth limits, offsets, slew rate
limits, and output current limits are very important if one is to achieve the design
performance of an op-amp circuit.

The temperature is monitored on a display (the load)
with a vertical line of light-emitting diodes. Normal

that a voltage be supplied to the display input terminals

SEMICONDUCTORS
AND DIODES

his chapter introduces a new topic: solid state electronics. You must be
familiar with the marvelous progress that has taken place in this field since the
invention of the transistor. Think of the progress that personal computing alone
has made in the last 50 years! Modern electronic systems are possible because
of individual discrete electronic devices that have been integrated into functioning
as complex systems. Although the use of discrete electronic devices has largely been
replaced by that of integrated circuits (e.g., the operational amplifier of Chapter 8), it
is still important to understand how the individual elements function. The aim of this
and of the next three chapters is to introduce the fundamental operation of semicon-
ductor electronic devices. These include two principal families of elements: diodes
and transistors. The focus of Chapters 9 through 11 is principally on discrete devices,
that is, on analyzing and using individual diodes and transistors in various circuits.
This chapter explains the workings of the semiconductor diode, a device that
finds use in many practical circuits used in electric power systems and in high- and
low-power electronic circuits. The emphasis in the chapter is on using simple models
of the semiconductor devices, and on reducing the resulting circuits to ones that we
can analyze based on the circuit analysis tools introduced in earlier chapters. This is
usually done in two steps: first, the i-v characteristic of the diode is analyzed, and it

is shown that one can use simple linear circuit elements (ideal resistors, ideal voltage
sources) to describe the operation of the diode by way of circuit models; second, the
circuit models are inserted in a practical circuit in place of the diode, and well-known
circuit analysis methods are employed to analyze the resulting linear circuit. Thus,
once you have understood how to select an appropriate diode model, you will once
again apply the basic circuit analysis principles that you mastered in the first part of
this book.

9.1 ELECTRICAL CONDUCTION IN
SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

This section briefly introduces the mechanism of conduction in a class of materials
called semiconductors. Elemental! or intrinsic semiconductors are materials consist-
ing of elements from group IV of the periodic table and having electrical properties
falling somewhere between those of conducting and of insulating materials. As an
example, consider the conductivity of three common materials. Copper, a good con-
ductor, has a conductivity of 0.59 x 10° S/cm; glass, a common insulator, may range
between 10~!° and 10~!3 S/cm; and silicon, a semiconductor, has a conductivity that
varies from 107° to 10~! S/cm. You see, then, that the name semiconductor is an
appropriate one.

A conducting material is characterized by a large number of conduction band
electrons, which have a very weak bond with the basic structure of the material.
Thus, an electric field easily imparts energy to the outer electrons in a conductor and
enables the flow of electric current. In a semiconductor, on the other hand, one needs
to consider the lattice structure of the material, which in this case is characterized
by covalent bonding. Figure 9.1 depicts the lattice arrangement for silicon (Si),
one of the more common semiconductors. At sufficiently high temperatures, thermal
energy causes the atoms in the lattice to vibrate; when sufficient kinetic energy is
present, some of the valence electrons break their bonds with the lattice structure and
become available as conduction electrons. These free electrons enable current flow
in the semiconductor. Note that in a conductor, valence electrons have a very loose

! Semiconductors can also be made of more than one element, in which case the elements are not
necessarily from group IV.

Part II Electronics

bond with the nucleus and are therefore available for conduction to a much greater
extent than valence electrons in a semiconductor. One important aspect of this type
of conduction is that the number of charge carriers depends on the amount of thermal
energy present in the structure. Thus, many semiconductor properties are a function
of temperature.

The free valence electrons are not the only mechanism of conduction in a
semiconductor, however. Whenever a free electron leaves the lattice structure, it
creates a corresponding positive charge within the lattice. Figure 9.2 depicts the
situation in which a covalent bond is missing because of the departure of a free elec-
tron from the structure. The vacancy caused by the departure of a free electron is
called a hole. Note that whenever a hole is present, we have, in effect, a positive
charge. The positive charges also contribute to the conduction process, in the sense
that if a valence band electron “jumps” to fill a neighboring hole, thereby neutraliz-
ing a positive charge, it correspondingly creates a new hole at a different location.
Thus, the effect is equivalent to that of a positive charge moving to the right, in the
sketch of Figure 9.2. This phenomenon becomes relevant when an external electric
field is applied to the material. It is important to point out here that the mobility—
that is, the ease with which charge carriers move across the lattice—differs greatly
for the two types of carriers. Free electrons can move far more easily around the
lattice than holes. To appreciate this, consider the fact that a free electron has al-
ready broken the covalent bond, whereas for a hole to travel through the structure,
an electron must overcome the covalent bond each time the hole jumps to a new
position.

According to this relatively simplified view of semiconductor materials, we
can envision a semiconductor as having two types of charge carriers—holes and free
electrons—which travel in opposite directions when the semiconductor is subjected
to an external electric field, giving rise to a net flow of current in the direction of the
electric field. Figure 9.3 illustrates the concept.

An additional phenomenon, called recombination, reduces the number of
charge carriers in a semiconductor. Occasionally, a free electron traveling in the
immediate neighborhood of a hole will recombine with the hole, to form a covalent
bond. Whenever this phenomenon takes place, two charge carriers are lost. However,
in spite of recombination, the net balance is such that a number of free electrons always
exist at a given temperature. These electrons are therefore available for conduction.
The number of free electrons available for a given material is called the intrinsic
concentration n;. For example, at room temperature, silicon has

nj = 1.5 x 10!° electrons/m° (9.1)

Note that there must be an equivalent number of holes present as well.
Semiconductor technology rarely employs pure, or intrinsic, semiconductors.
To control the number of charge carriers in a semiconductor, the process of doping is
usually employed. Doping consists of adding impurities to the crystalline structure of
the semiconductor. The amount of these impurities is controlled, and the impurities
can be of one of two types. If the dopant is an element from the fifth column of the
periodic table (e.g., arsenic), the end result is that wherever an impurity is present, an
additional free electron is available for conduction. Figure 9.4 illustrates the concept.
The elements providing the impurities are called donors in the case of group V
elements, since they “donate” an additional free electron to the lattice structure. An
equivalent situation arises when group III elements (e.g., indium) are used to dope
silicon. In this case, however, an additional hole is created by the doping element,

Chapter 9 Semiconductors and Diodes

which is called an acceptor, since it accepts a free electron from the structure and
generates a hole in doing so.

Semiconductors doped with donor elements conduct current predominantly by
means of free electrons and are therefore called n-type semiconductors. When an
acceptor element is used as the dopant, holes constitute the most common carrier, and
the resulting semiconductor is said to be a p-type semiconductor. Doping usually
takes place at such levels that the concentration of carriers due to the dopant is
significantly greater than the intrinsic concentration of the original semiconductor. If
n is the total number of free electrons and p that of holes, then in an n-type doped
semiconductor, we have

n> nj (9.2)
and
p< Di (9.3)

Thus, free electrons are the majority carriers in an n-type material, while holes are
the minority carriers. In a p-type material, the majority and minority carriers are
reversed.

Doping is a standard practice for a number of reasons. Among these are the abil-
ity to control the concentration of charge carriers and the increase in the conductivity
of the material that results from doping.

9.2. THE pn JUNCTION AND THE
SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE

A simple section of semiconductor material does not in and of itself possess properties
that make it useful for the construction of electronic circuits. However, when a section
of p-type material and a section of n-type material are brought in contact to form a
pn junction, a number of interesting properties arise. The pn junction forms the basis
of the semiconductor diode, a widely used circuit element.

Figure 9.5 depicts an idealized pn junction, where on the p side we see a dom-
inance of positive charge carriers, or holes, and on the n side, the free electrons
dominate. Now, in the neighborhood of the junction, in a small section called the
depletion region, the mobile charge carriers (holes and free electrons) come into
contact with each other and recombine, thus leaving virtually no charge carriers at the
junction. What is left in the depletion region, in the absence of the charge carriers, is
the lattice structure of the n-type material on the right and of the p-type material on the
left. But the n-type material, deprived of the free electrons, which have recombined
with holes in the neighborhood of the junction, is now positively charged. Similarly,

The p-side depletion region is negatively The n-side depletion region is positively
charged because its holes have recombined charged because its free electrons have
with free electrons from the n side recombined with holes from the p side

Figure 9.5 A pn junction

Part II Electronics

the p-type material at the junction is negatively charged, because holes have been
lost to recombination. The net effect is that while most of the material (p- or n-type)
is charge-neutral because the lattice structure and the charge carriers neutralize each
other (on average), the depletion region sees a separation of charge, giving rise to an
electric field pointing from the n side to the p side. The charge separation therefore
causes a contact potential to exist at the junction. This potential is typically on the
order of a few tenths of a volt and depends on the material (about 0.6 to 0.7 V for
silicon). The contact potential is also called the offset voltage V,,.

Now, in the n-type materials, holes are the minority carriers; the relatively few
p-type carriers (holes) are thermally generated, and recombine with free electrons.
Some of these holes drift into the depletion region (to the left, in Figure 9.5), and they
are pushed across the junction by the existing electric field. A similar situation exists
in the p-type material, where now electrons drift across the depletion region (to the
right). The net effect is that a small reverse saturation current /s; flows through the
junction in the reverse direction (to the left) when the diode is reverse biased [see
Figure 9.7(a)]. This current is largely independent of the junction voltage and is
mostly determined by thermal carrier generation; that is, it is dependent on tempera-
ture. As the temperature increases, more hole-electron pairs are thermally generated,
and the greater number of minority carriers produce a greater J; [at room temperature,
Ts is on the order of nanoamperes (10~? A) in silicon]. This current across the junc-
tion flows opposite to the drift current and is called diffusion current J;. Of course, if
a hole from the p side enters the n side, it is quite likely that it will quickly
recombine with one of the n-type carriers on the n side. One way to explain diffusion
current is to visualize the diffusion of a gas ina room: gas molecules naturally tend to
diffuse from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. Similarly,
the p-type material, for example, has a much greater concentration of holes than the
n-type material. Thus, some holes will tend to diffuse into the n-type material across
the junction, although only those that have sufficient (thermal) energy to do so will
succeed. Figure 9.6 illustrates this process for a diode in equilibrium, with no bias
applied.

The phenomena of drift and diffusion help explain how a pn junction behaves
when it is connected to an external energy source. Consider the diagrams of Figure 9.7,
where a battery has been connected to a pn junction in the reverse-biased direc-
tion [Figure 9.7(a)] and in the forward-biased direction [Figure 9.7(b)]. We assume
that some suitable form of contact between the battery wires and the semiconductor
material can be established (this is called an ohmic contact). The effect of a reverse
bias is to increase the contact potential at the junction. Now, the majority carriers
trying to diffuse across the junction need to overcome a greater barrier (a larger
potential) and a wider depletion region. Thus, the diffusion current becomes negligi-
ble. The only current that flows under reverse bias is the very small reverse saturation
current, so that the diode current ip (defined in the figure) is

p= —lh =1s (9.4)

while the reverse saturation current above is actually a minority-carrier drift current.
When the pn junction is forward-biased, the contact potential across the junction is
lowered (note that Vz acts in opposition to the contact potential). Now, the diffusion of
majority carriers is aided by the external voltage source; in fact, the diffusion current
increases as a function of the applied voltage, according to equation 9.5

where vp is the voltage across the pn junction, k = 1.381 x 107° J/K is Boltzmann’s

Figure 9.8 Semiconductor diode i-v characteristic

The ability of the pn junction to essentially conduct current in only one
direction—that is, to conduct only when the junction is forward-biased—makes it
valuable in circuit applications. A device having a single pn junction and ohmic
contacts at its terminals, as described in the preceding paragraphs, is called a semi-
conductor diode, or simply diode. As will be shown later in this chapter, it finds use
in many practical circuits. The circuit symbol for the diode is shown in Figure 9.9,
along with a sketch of the pn junction.

Figure 9.10 summarizes the behavior of the semiconductor diode by means of
its i-v characteristic; it will become apparent later that this i-v characteristic plays
an important role in constructing circuit models for the diode. Note that a third re-
gion appears in the diode i-v curve that has not been discussed yet. The reverse
breakdown region to the far left of the curve represents the behavior of the diode
when a sufficiently high reverse bias is applied. Under sucha large reverse bias (greater
in magnitude than the voltage Vz, a quantity that will be explained shortly), the diode
conducts current again, this time in the reverse direction. To explain the mechanism
of reverse conduction, one needs to visualize the phenomenon of avalanche break-
down. When a very large negative bias is applied to the pn junction, sufficient energy
is imparted to charge carriers that reverse current can flow, well beyond the normal
reverse saturation current. In addition, because of the large electric field, electrons are

energized to such levels that if they collide with other charge carriers at a lower energy
level, some of their energy is transferred to the carriers with lower energy, and these
can now contribute to the reverse conduction process as well. This process is called
impact ionization. Now, these new carriers may also have enough energy to ener-
gize other low-energy electrons by impact ionization, so that once a sufficiently high
reverse bias is provided, this process of conduction is very much like an avalanche:
a single electron can ionize several others.

The phenomenon of Zener breakdown is related to avalanche breakdown. It
is usually achieved by means of heavily doped regions in the neighborhood of the
metal-semiconductor junction (the ohmic contact). The high density of charge carriers
provides the means for a substantial reverse breakdown current to be sustained, at
a nearly constant reverse bias, the Zener voltage Vz. This phenomenon is very useful
in applications where one would like to hold some load voltage constant, for example,
in voltage regulators, which are discussed in a later section.

To summarize the behavior of the semiconductor diode, it is useful to refer to the
sketch of Figure 9.10, observing that when the voltage across the diode up is greater
than the offset voltage V,,, the diode is said to be forward-biased and acts nearly as
a short circuit, readily conducting current. When up is between V,, and the Zener
breakdown voltage —Vz, the diode acts very much as an open circuit, conducting
a small reverse current J of the order of only nanoamperes (nA). Finally, if the
voltage vp is more negative than the Zener voltage —Vz, the diode conducts again,
this time in the reverse direction.

9.3 CIRCUIT MODELS FOR THE
SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE

From the viewpoint of a user of electronic circuits (as opposed to a designer), it is
often sufficient to characterize a device in terms of its i-v characteristic, using either
load-line analysis or appropriate circuit models to determine the operating currents
and voltages. This section shows how it is possible to use the i-v characteristics of
the semiconductor diode to construct simple yet useful circuit models. Depending on
the desired level of detail, it is possible to construct large-signal models of the diode,
which describe the gross behavior of the device in the presence of relatively large
voltages and currents; or small-signal models, which are capable of describing the

behavior of the diode in finer detail and, in particular, the response of the diode to
small changes in the average diode voltage and current. From the user’s standpoint,
these circuit models greatly simplify the analysis of diode circuits and make it possible
to effectively analyze relatively “difficult” circuits simply by using the familiar circuit
analysis tools of Chapter 3. The first two major divisions of this section describe
different diode models and the assumptions under which they are obtained, to provide
the knowledge you will need to select and use the appropriate model for a given
application.

Large-Signal Diode Models

Ideal Diode Model

Our first large-signal model treats the diode as a simple on/off device (much like
acheck valve in hydraulic circuits; see the “Make The Connection” sidebar “Hydraulic
Check Valves’’).

Figure 9.11 illustrates how, on a large scale, the i-v characteristic of a typical
diode may be approximated by an open circuit when vp < 0 and by a short circuit
when up > 0 (recall the i-v curves of the ideal short and open circuits presented in
Chapter 2). The analysis of a circuit containing a diode may be greatly simplified
by using the short-circuit—open-circuit model. From here on, this diode model will
be known as the ideal diode model. In spite of its simplicity, the ideal diode model
(indicated by the symbol shown in Figure 9.11) can be very useful in analyzing diode
circuits.

In the remainder of the chapter, ideal diodes will always be represented by the
filled (black) triangle symbol shown in Figure 9.11.

Consider the circuit shown in Figure 9.12, which contains a 1.5-V battery, an
ideal diode, and a 1-kQ2 resistor. A technique will now be developed to determine
whether the diode is conducting or not, with the aid of the ideal diode model.

Assume first that the diode is conducting (or, equivalently, that up > 0). This
enables us to substitute a short circuit in place of the diode, as shown in Figure 9.13,
since the diode is now represented by a short circuit, up = 0. This is consistent with
the initial assumption (i.e., diode “on’’), since the diode is assumed to conduct for

Figure 9.12, assuming that

Up = 0 and since vp = 0 does not contradict the assumption. The series current in
the circuit (and through the diode) is ip = 1.5/1,000 = 1.5 mA. To summarize, the
assumption that the diode is on in the circuit of Figure 9.13 allows us to assume a
positive (clockwise) current in the circuit. Since the direction of the current and the
diode voltage are consistent with the assumption that the diode is on (up > 0, ip > 0),
it must be concluded that the diode is indeed conducting.

Suppose, now, that the diode had been assumed to be off. In this case, the diode
would be represented by an open circuit, as shown in Figure 9.14. Applying KVL to
the circuit of Figure 9.14 reveals that the voltage vp must equal the battery voltage,
or Up = 1.5 V, since the diode is assumed to be an open circuit and no current flows
through the circuit. Equation 9.8 must then apply.

But the result up = 1.5 Vis contrary to the initial assumption (that is, up < 0). Thus,
assuming that the diode is off leads to an inconsistent answer. Clearly, the assumption
must be incorrect, and therefore the diode must be conducting.

This method can be very useful in more involved circuits, where it is not quite
so obvious whether a diode is seeing a positive or a negative bias. The method is
particularly effective in these cases, since one can make an educated guess whether
the diode is on or off and can solve the resulting circuit to verify the correctness of the
initial assumption. Some solved examples are perhaps the best way to illustrate the
concept.

FOCUS ONMETHODOLOGY
DETERMINING THE CONDUCTION STATE OF AN IDEAL DIODE

1. Assume a diode conduction state (on or off).

2. Substitute ideal circuit model into circuit (short circuit if “on,” open
circuit if “off’’).

3. Solve for diode current and voltage, using linear circuit analysis
techniques.

4. If the solution is consistent with the assumption, then the initial
assumption was correct; if not, the diode conduction state is opposite to
that initially assumed. For example, if the diode has been assumed to be
“off” but the diode voltage computed after replacing the diode with an
open circuit is a forward bias, then it must be true that the actual state of
the diode is “on.”

EXAMPLE 9.1 Determining the Conduction State of an Ideal

Problem

Determine whether the ideal diode of Figure 9.15 is conducting.

Solution

Known Quantities: Vs; = 12 V; Vg = 11 V; R; = 5 Q; Ry = 10 Q; R3 = 10Q.
Find: The conduction state of the diode.

Assumptions: Use the ideal diode model.

Analysis: Assume initially that the ideal diode does not conduct, and replace it with an open
circuit, as shown in Figure 9.16. The voltage across Rp can then be computed by using the
voltage divider rule:

R, 10
= Vs =
Ri +R. 5+ 10

V1 12=8V
Applying KVL to the right-hand-side mesh (and observing that no current flows in the circuit
since the diode is assumed off), we obtain

vy = Up + Vz or vp =8-11=-3V
The result indicates that the diode is reverse-biased, and confirms the initial assumption. Thus,
the diode is not conducting.

As further illustration, let us make the opposite assumption and assume that the diode
conducts. In this case, we should replace the diode with a short circuit, as shown in Figure 9.17.
The resulting circuit is solved by node analysis, noting that v; = v2 since the diode is assumed
to act as a short circuit.

v, = 2.5(2.44 1.1) = 8.75 V

Since vj = v2 < Vg = 11 V, we must conclude that current is flowing in the reverse direction
(from Vz to node v2/v,) through the diode. This observation is inconsistent with the initial
assumption, since if the diode were conducting, we could see current flow only in the forward
direction. Thus, the initial assumption was incorrect, and we must conclude that the diode is
not conducting.

Comments: The formulation of diode problems illustrated in this example is based on making
an initial assumption. The assumption results in replacing the ideal diode with either a short or
an open circuit. Once this step is completed, the resulting circuit is a linear circuit and can be
solved by known methods to verify the consistency of the initial assumption.

One of the important applications of the semiconductor diode is in rectification
of AC signals, that is, the ability to convert an AC signal with zero average (DC) value
to a signal with a nonzero DC value. The application of the semiconductor diode as
a rectifier is very useful in obtaining DC voltage supplies from the readily available
AC line voltage. Here, we illustrate the basic principle of rectification, using an ideal
diode—for simplicity, and because the large-signal model is appropriate when the
diode is used in applications involving large AC voltage and current levels.

Consider the circuit of Figure 9.20, where an AC source v; = 155.56 sin wt is
connected to a load by means of a series ideal diode. From the analysis of Example
9.1, it should be apparent that the diode will conduct only during the positive half-
cycle of the sinusoidal voltage—that is, that the condition vp > 0 will be satisfied
only when the AC source voltage is positive—and that it will act as an open circuit
during the negative half-cycle of the sinusoid (vp < 0). Thus, the appearance of the
load voltage will be as shown in Figure 9.21, with the negative portion of the sinu-
soidal waveform cut off. The rectified waveform clearly has a nonzero DC (average)
voltage, whereas the average input waveform voltage was zero. When the diode is
conducting, or vp > 0, the unknowns v; and ip can be found by using the following
equations:

Ui

vy, = ipR, (9.10)

The load voltage vz, and the input voltage v; are sketched in Figure 9.21. From equation
9.10, it is obvious that the current waveform has the same shape as the load voltage.
The average value of the load voltage is obtained by integrating the load voltage over
one period and dividing by the period:

waveform by means of a full-wave rectifier.

Offset Diode Model

While the ideal diode model is useful in approximating the large-scale characteristics
of a physical diode, it does not account for the presence of an offset voltage, which
is an unavoidable component in semiconductor diodes (recall the discussion of the
contact potential in Section 9.2). The offset diode model consists of an ideal diode
in series with a battery of strength equal to the offset voltage (we shall use the value
V,, = 0.6 V for silicon diodes, unless otherwise indicated). The effect of the battery is
to shift the characteristic of the ideal diode to the right on the voltage axis, as shown
in Figure 9.22. This model is a better approximation of the large-signal behavior of a
semiconductor diode than the ideal diode model.

According to the offset diode model, the diode of Figure 9.22 acts as an open
circuit for up < 0.6 V, and it behaves as a 0.6-V battery for vp > 0.6 V. The equations
describing the offset diode model are as follows:

Up < 0.6 V

Diode — 0.6-V battery

Diode — open circuit

Offset diode model (9.12)

The offset diode model may be represented by an ideal diode in series with a 0.6-V
ideal battery, as shown in Figure 9.23. Use of the offset diode model is best described
by means of examples.

Solution

Known Quantities: vs(t) = 3 cosat; V, = 0.6 V.
Find: An analytical expression for the load voltage.
Assumptions: Use the offset diode model.

Analysis: We start by replacing the diode with the offset diode model, as shown in the lower
half of Figure 9.24. Now we can use the method developed earlier for ideal diode analysis;
that is, we can focus on determining whether the voltage up across the ideal diode is positive
(diode on) or negative (diode off).

Assume first that the diode is off. The resulting circuit is shown in Figure 9.25(a). Since
no current flows in the circuit, we obtain the following expression for vp:

Up = vs — 0.6
To be consistent with the assumption that the diode is off, we require that up be negative, which
in turn corresponds to

vs < 0.6 V Diode off condition

With the diode off, the current in the circuit is zero, and the load voltage is also zero. If the
source voltage is greater than 0.6 V, the diode conducts, and the current flowing in the circuit
and resulting load voltage are given by the expressions

j= oes Ur = R= vs — 0.6

We summarize these results as follows:
0 for vs < 0.6 V
vs — 0.6 for vs > 0.6 V

Comments: Note that use of the offset diode model leads to problems that are very similar to
ideal diode problems, with the addition of a voltage source in the circuit.

Also observe that the load voltage waveform is shifted downward by an amount equal
to the offset voltage V,,. The shift is visible in the case of this example because V,, is a
substantial fraction of the source voltage. If the source voltage had peak values of tens or
hundreds of volts, such a shift would be negligible, and an ideal diode model would serve
just as well.

Small-Signal Diode Models

As one examines the diode i-v characteristic more closely, it becomes apparent that
the short-circuit approximation is not adequate to represent the small-signal behavior
of the diode. The term small-signal behavior usually signifies the response of the
diode to small time-varying signals that may be superimposed on the average diode
current and voltage. Figure 9.8 depicts a close-up view of a silicon diode i-v curve.
From this figure, it should be apparent that the short-circuit approximation is not
very accurate when a diode’s behavior is viewed on an expanded scale. To a first-
order approximation, however, the i-v characteristic resembles that of a resistor (i.e.,
is linear) for voltages greater than the offset voltage. Thus, it may be reasonable
to model the diode as a resistor (instead of a short circuit) once it is conducting,
to account for the slope of its i-v curve. In the following discussion, the method
of load-line analysis (which was introduced in Chapter 3) is exploited to determine
the small-signal resistance of a diode.

Consider the circuit of Figure 9.29, which represents the Thévenin equivalent
circuit of an arbitrary linear resistive circuit connected to a diode. Equations 9.13 and
9.14 describe the operation of the circuit:

arises from application of KVL, and
ip = In(e%/" — 1) (9.14)

is the diode equation (9.6).

Although we have two equations in two unknowns, these cannot be solved
analytically, since one of the equations contains up in exponential form. As discussed
in Chapter 3, two methods exist for the solution of transcendental equations of this
type: graphical and numerical. In the present case, only the graphical solution shall

be considered. The graphical solution is best understood if we associate a curve in
the ip—vup plane with each of the two preceding equations. The diode equation gives
rise to the familiar curve of Figure 9.8. The load-line equation, obtained by KVL, is
the equation of a line with slope —1/R and ordinate intercept given by V7/Rr.

The superposition of these two curves gives rise to the plot of Figure 9.30, where the
solution to the two equations is graphically found to be the pair of values Ug, Vo). The
intersection of the two curves is called the quiescent (operating) point, or Q point.
The voltage up = Vg and the current ip = Jg are the actual diode voltage and current
when the diode is connected as in the circuit of Figure 9.29. Note that this method
is also useful for circuits containing a larger number of elements, provided that we
can represent these circuits by their Thévenin equivalents, with the diode appearing
as the load.

maximum allowable average current (1 A) and the maximum surge current, which is the maximum short-time
burst current the diode can sustain without being destroyed. Also mentioned are the power rating and operating
temperatures. Note that in the entry for the total device power dissipation, derating information is also given.
Derating implies that the device power dissipation will change as a function of temperature, in this case at the
rate of 20 mW/°C. For example, if we expect to operate the diode at a temperature of 100°C, we calculate a
derated power of

P =2.5 W — (75°C x 0.02 mW/°C) = 1.0 W

Thus, the diode operated at a higher temperature can dissipate only | W.

Piecewise Linear Diode Model

The graphical solution of diode circuits can be somewhat tedious, and its accuracy
is limited by the resolution of the graph; it does, however, provide insight into the
piecewise linear diode model. In the piecewise linear model, the diode is treated as
an open circuit in the off state and as a linear resistor in series with V,, in the on state.
Figure 9.35 illustrates the graphical appearance of this model. Note that the straight
line that approximates the on part of the diode characteristic is tangent to the Q point.
Thus, in the neighborhood of the Q point, the diode does act as a linear small-signal
resistance, with slope given by 1/rp, where
1 dip . . ‘

— = — Diode incremental resistance (9.16)

rp dUp (Io.Vo)
That is, it acts as a linear resistance whose i-v characteristic is the tangent to the
diode curve at the operating point. The tangent is extended to meet the voltage axis,
thus defining the intersection as the diode offset voltage. Thus, rather than represent
the diode by a short circuit in its forward-biased state, we treat it as a linear resistor,
with resistance rp. The piecewise linear model offers the convenience of a linear
representation once the state of the diode is established, and of a more accurate model
than either the ideal or the offset diode model. This model is very useful in illustrating
the performance of diodes in real-world applications.

From the preceding expression we can compute the incremental resistance, using equation 9.16:

Comments: It is important to understand that while one can calculate the linearized incre-
mental resistance of a diode at an operating point, this does not mean that the diode can be treated
simply as a resistor. The linearized small-signal resistance of the diode is used in the piecewise
linear diode model to account for the fact that there is a dependence between diode voltage
and current (i.e., the diode i-v curve is not exactly a vertical line for voltages above the offset
voltage—see Figure 9.35).

applying KVL to the circuit of Figure 9.37:
Us = V1 + v2 + up + 0.6 + vu
Up = Vs — Vt — V2 — 0.6 — v,

We use the above equation as was done in Example 9.4, that is, to determine the source voltage
value for which the diode first conducts. Observe first that the diode will be off for negative
values of vs. With the diode off, that is, an open circuit, the voltages v;, v2, and v, are zero and
Up = vs — 0.6
Thus, the condition for the ideal diode to conduct (vp > 0) corresponds to

9.4 RECTIFIER CIRCUITS

This section illustrates some of the applications of diodes to practical engineering
circuits. The nonlinear behavior of diodes, especially the rectification property, makes
these devices valuable in a number of applications. In this section, more advanced
rectifier circuits (the full-wave rectifier and the bridge rectifier) will be explored, as
well as limiter and peak detector circuits. These circuits will be analyzed by making
use of the circuit models developed in the preceding sections; as stated earlier, these
models are more than adequate to develop an understanding of the operation of diode
circuits.

The Full-Wave Rectifier

The half-wave rectifier discussed earlier is one simple method of converting AC
energy to DC energy. The need for converting one form of electric energy to the other
arises frequently in practice. The most readily available form of electric power is
AC (the standard 110- or 220-V rms AC line power), but one frequently needs a DC
power supply, for applications ranging from the control of certain types of electric
motors to the operation of electronic circuits such as those discussed in Chapters 8
through 12. You will have noticed that most consumer electronic circuits, from CD
players to personal computers, require AC-DC power adapters.

The half-wave rectifier, however, is not a very efficient AC-DC conversion
circuit, because it fails to utilize one-half of the energy available in the AC waveform,
by not conducting current during the negative half-cycle of the AC waveform. The
full-wave rectifier shown in Figure 9.39 offers a substantial improvement in efficiency
over the half-wave rectifier. The first section of the full-wave rectifier circuit includes
an AC source and a center-tapped transformer (see Chapter 7) with 1:2N turns ratio.
The purpose of the transformer is to obtain the desired voltage amplitude prior to
rectification. Thus, if the peak amplitude of the AC source voltage is us, the amplitude
of the voltage across each half of the output side of the transformer will be Nus; this
scheme permits scaling the source voltage up or down (depending on whether WN is
greater or less than 1), according to the specific requirements of the application. In
addition to scaling the source voltage, the transformer isolates the rectifier circuit

from the AC source voltage, since there is no direct electrical connection between the
input and output of a transformer (see Chapter 13).

In the analysis of the full-wave rectifier, the diodes will be treated as ideal,
since in most cases the source voltage is the AC line voltage (110 V rms, 60 Hz)
and therefore the offset voltage is negligible in comparison. The key to the operation
of the full-wave rectifier is to note that during the positive half-cycle of vs, the top
diode is forward-biased while the bottom diode is reverse-biased; therefore, the load
current during the positive half-cycle is

while during the negative half-cycle, the bottom diode conducts and the top diode is
off, and the load current is given by

—Ni Us
Ri
Note that the direction of iz is always positive, because of the manner of connect-
ing the diodes (when the top diode is off, i, is forced to flow from plus to minus

across R_;).

The source voltage, the load voltage, and the currents i; and iz are shown in
Figure 9.40 for a load resistance Rp = 1 Q and N = 1. The full-wave rectifier results
in a twofold improvement in efficiency over the half-wave rectifier introduced earlier.

The Bridge Rectifier

Another rectifier circuit commonly available “off the shelf” as a single integrated-
circuit package? is the bridge rectifier, which employs four diodes in a bridge config-
uration, similar to the Wheatstone bridge already explored in Chapter 2. Figure 9.41
depicts the bridge rectifier, along with the associated integrated-circuit (IC) package.

The analysis of the bridge rectifier is simple to understand by visualizing the
operation of the rectifier for the two half-cycles of the AC waveform separately.
The key is that, as illustrated in Figure 9.42, diodes D; and D3 conduct during the
positive half-cycle, while diodes D, and D, conduct during the negative half-cycle.
Because of the structure of the bridge, the flow of current through the load resistor
is in the same direction (from c to d) during both halves of the cycle, hence, the

Figure 9.43(b) depicts the rectified waveform if we assume diodes with a 0.6-V offset
voltage. Note that the waveform of Figure 9.43(b) is not a pure rectified sinusoid any
longer: The effect of the offset voltage is to shift the waveform downward by twice the
offset voltage. This is most easily understood by considering that the load seen by the
source during either half-cycle consists of two diodes in series with the load resistor.

Although the conventional and bridge full-wave rectifier circuits effectively
convert AC signals that have zero average, or DC, value to a signal with a nonzero
average voltage, either rectifier’s output is still an oscillating waveform. Rather than
provide a smooth, constant voltage, the full-wave rectifier generates a sequence of

433

434

Chapter 9 Semiconductors and Diodes

sinusoidal pulses at a frequency double that of the original AC signal. The ripple—
that is, the fluctuation about the mean voltage that is characteristic of these rectifier
circuits—is undesirable if one desires a true DC supply. A simple yet effective means
of eliminating most of the ripple (i.e., AC component) associated with the output of
a rectifier is to take advantage of the energy storage properties of capacitors to filter
out the ripple component of the load voltage. A low-pass filter that preserves the DC
component of the rectified voltage while filtering out components at frequencies at or
above twice the AC signal frequency would be an appropriate choice to remove the
ripple component from the rectified voltage. In most practical applications of rectifier
circuits, the signal waveform to be rectified is the 60-Hz, 110-V rms line voltage. The
ripple frequency is, therefore, frppie = 120 HZ, or @yippie = 27 - 120 rad/s. A low-pass
filter is required for which

9.5 DC POWER SUPPLIES, ZENER DIODES,
AND VOLTAGE REGULATION

The principal application of rectifier circuits is in the conversion of AC to DC power.
A circuit that accomplishes this conversion is usually called a DC power supply.
In power supply applications, transformers are employed to obtain an AC voltage
that is reasonably close to the desired DC supply voltage. DC power supplies are
very useful in practice: Many familiar electric and electronic appliances (e.g., radios,
personal computers, TVs) require DC power to operate. For most applications, it is
desirable that the DC supply be as steady and ripple-free as possible. To ensure that
the DC voltage generated by a DC supply is constant, DC supplies contain voltage
regulators, that is, devices that can hold a DC load voltage relatively constant in spite
of possible fluctuations in the DC supply. This section describes the fundamentals of
voltage regulators.

A typical DC power supply is made up of the components shown in Figure 9.45.
In the figure, a transformer is shown connecting the AC source to the rectifier circuit

to permit scaling of the AC voltage to the desired level. For example, one might
wish to step the 110-V rms line voltage down to a lower DC voltage by means
of a transformer prior to rectification and filtering, to eventually obtain a 12-VDC
regulated supply (regulated here means that the output voltage is a DC voltage that
is constant and independent of load and supply variations). Following the step-down
transformer are a bridge rectifier, a filter capacitor, a voltage regulator, and finally
the load.

The most common device employed in voltage regulation schemes is the Zener
diode. Zener diodes function on the basis of the reverse portion of the i-v characteristic
of the diode discussed in Section 9.2. Figure 9.10 in Section 9.2 illustrates the general
characteristic of a diode, with forward offset voltage V, and reverse Zener voltage
Vz. Note how steep the i-v characteristic is at the Zener breakdown voltage, indicating
that in the Zener breakdown region the diode can hold a very nearly constant voltage
for a large range of currents. This property makes it possible to use the Zener diode
as a voltage reference.

With reference to Figure 9.10, we see that once the Zener diode is reverse-biased
with a reverse voltage larger than the Zener voltage, the Zener diode behaves very
nearly as an ideal voltage source, providing a voltage reference that is nearly constant.
This reference is not exact because the slope of the Zener diode curve for voltages
lower than —Vz is not infinite; the finite slope will cause the Zener voltage to change
slightly. For the purpose of this analysis, we assume that the reverse-biased Zener
voltage is actually constant. The operation of the Zener diode as a voltage regulator
is simplified in the analysis shown in the rest of this section to illustrate some of
the limitations of voltage regulator circuits. The circuits analyzed in the remainder
of this section do not represent practical voltage regulator designs, but are useful to
understand the basic principles of voltage regulation.

The operation of the Zener diode may be analyzed by considering three modes
of operation:

1. For up = V,,, the device acts as a conventional forward-biased diode
(Figure 9.46).
For Vz < up < V,, the diode is reverse-biased but Zener breakdown has not
taken place yet. Thus, it acts as an open circuit.

3. For vp < Vz, Zener breakdown occurs and the device holds a nearly constant
voltage —Vz (Figure 9.47).

The combined effect of forward and reverse bias may be lumped into a single model
with the aid of ideal diodes, as shown in Figure 9.48.

To illustrate the operation of a Zener diode as a voltage regulator, consider the
circuit of Figure 9.49(a), where the unregulated DC source Vs is regulated to the value
of the Zener voltage Vz. Note how the diode must be connected “upside down” to
obtain a positive regulated voltage. Note also that if vs is greater than Vz, it follows
that the Zener diode is in its reverse breakdown mode. Thus, one need not worry
whether the diode is conducting or not in simple voltage regulator problems, provided
that the unregulated supply voltage is guaranteed to stay above Vz (a problem arises,
however, if the unregulated supply can drop below the Zener voltage). Assuming
that the resistance rz is negligible with respect to Rs and R,, we replace the Zener
diode with the simplified circuit model of Figure 9.49(b), consisting of a battery of
strength Vz (the effects of the nonzero Zener resistance are explored in the examples
and homework problems).

Three simple observations are sufficient to explain the operation of this voltage
regulator:

1. The load voltage must equal Vz, as long as the Zener diode is in the reverse
breakdown mode. Then

Vz

-2 (9.20)

in
2. The load current (which should be constant if the load voltage is to be regulated
to sustain Vz) is the difference between the unregulated supply current is and
the diode current iz:

i, =is —iz (9.21)

This second point explains intuitively how a Zener diode operates: Any current
in excess of that required to keep the load at the constant voltage Vz is
“dumped” to ground through the diode. Thus, the Zener diode acts as a sink to
the undesired source current.

3. The source current is given by

i, = Vz (9.22)
Rs
In the ideal case, the operation of a Zener voltage regulator can be explained very
simply on the basis of this model. The examples and exercises will illustrate the effects
of the practical limitations that arise in the design of a practical voltage regulator; the
general principles are discussed in the following paragraphs.

Part II Electronics

The Zener diode is usually rated in terms of its maximum allowable power
dissipation. The power dissipated by the diode Pz may be computed from

Pz = izVz (9.23)

Thus, one needs to worry about the possibility that iz will become too large. This may
occur either if the supply current is very large (perhaps because of an unexpected
upward fluctuation of the unregulated supply) or if the load is suddenly removed and
all the supply current sinks through the diode. The latter case, of an open-circuit load,
is an important design consideration.

Another significant limitation occurs when the load resistance is small, thus
requiring large amounts of current from the unregulated supply. In this case, the
Zener diode is hardly taxed at all in terms of power dissipation, but the unregulated
supply may not be able to provide the current required to sustain the load voltage. In
this case, regulation fails to take place. Thus, in practice, the range of load resistances
for which load voltage regulation may be attained is constrained to a finite interval:

Rimin < Rt S Rimax (9.24)

where Rz max is typically limited by the Zener diode power dissipation and Rz min by
the maximum supply current. Examples 9.10 through 9.12 illustrate these concepts.

EXAMPLE 9.10 Determining the Power Rating of a Zener Diode

Problem

We wish to design a regulator similar to the one depicted in Figure 9.49(a). Determine the
minimum acceptable power rating of the Zener diode.

Solution

Known Quantities: vs = 24 V; Vz = 12 V; Rs = 50 Q; R, = 250 Q.

Find: The maximum power dissipated by the Zener diode under worst-case conditions.
Assumptions: Use the piecewise linear Zener diode model (Figure 9.48) with rz = 0.

Analysis: When the regulator operates according to the intended design specifications, that
is, with a 250-Q load, the source and load currents may be computed as follows:

- 12
is = OM =P Loma
Rs 50
Vz 12
=~ = = =0.048A
R250

Thus, the Zener current would be
iz =is —ip =0.192 A

corresponding to a nominal power dissipation
Pz = iwWz = 0.192 x 12 = 2.304 W

However, if the load were accidentally (or intentionally) disconnected from the circuit, all the
load current would be diverted to flow through the Zener diode. Thus, the worst-case Zener
current is actually equal to the source current, since the Zener diode would sink all the source

( LO4

Chapter 9 Semiconductors and Diodes

current for an open-circuit load:

-v, 12
vs NZ _ = _o24a
Rs 50

izmax = is =
Therefore the maximum power dissipation that the Zener diode must sustain is

Pz max = iz max Vz = 2.88 W

Comments: A safe design would exceed the value of Pz max computed above. For example,
one might select a 3-W Zener diode.

EXAMPLE 9.11 Calculation of Allowed Load Resistances
for a Given Zener Regulator

Problem

Calculate the allowable range of load resistances for the Zener regulator of Figure 9.50 such
that the diode power rating is not exceeded.

Solution
Known Quantities: Vs; = 50 V; Vz = 14 V; Pz =5 W.

Find: The smallest and largest values of R; for which load voltage regulation to 14 V is
achieved, and which do not cause the diode power rating to be exceeded.

Assumptions: Use the piecewise linear Zener diode model (Figure 9.48) with rz = 0.
Analysis:

1. Determining the minimum acceptable load resistance. To determine the minimum
acceptable load, we observe that the regulator can at most supply the load with the amount
of current that can be provided by the source. Thus, the minimum theoretical resistance
can be computed by assuming that all the source current goes to the load, and that the
load voltage is regulated at the nominal value:

Vz Vz 14

= = = 11.72
is (Vs — Vz)/30 36/30

Rimin =

If the load required any more current, the source would not be able to supply it. Note
that for this value of the load, the Zener diode dissipates zero power, because the Zener
current is zero.

Part II Electronics 441

2. Determining the maximum acceptable load resistance. The second constraint we need to
invoke is the power rating of the diode. For the stated 5-W rating, the maximum Zener
current is

Pz 5

izmx = — = T= 0.357 A
Vz 14

Since the source can generate

i - Vso Ve _ 50-14 ay
Smax = 30 = 30 =i.

the load must not require any less than 1.2 — 0.357 = 0.843 A; if it required any less
current (i.e., if the resistance were too large), the Zener diode would be forced to sink
more current than its power rating permits. From this requirement we can compute the
maximum allowable load resistance

Vz «14
is max iz max 7 0.843

= 16.62

Rimin =

Finally, the range of allowable load resistance is 11.7 Q < R; < 16.6 Q.

Comments: Note that this regulator cannot operate with an open-circuit load! This is
obviously not a very useful circuit.

Find: Amplitude of ripple component in load voltage.
Assumptions: Use the piecewise linear Zener diode model (Figure 9.48).

Analysis: To analyze the circuit, we consider the DC and AC equivalent circuits of Figure 9.53
separately.

1. DC equivalent circuit. The DC equivalent circuit reveals that the load voltage consists of
two contributions: that due to the unregulated DC supply and that due to the Zener diode
Vz. Applying superposition and the voltage divider rule, we obtain

L>= Ys TS, UD Zz TS, OUD —_ . —O-

2. AC equivalent circuit. The AC equivalent circuit allows us to compute the AC component
of the load voltage as follows:

rz||Ri
= Uy ———— ] =0.016 V
YE = Weippe (;; Ri + z)

that is, 16 mV of ripple is present in the load voltage, or approximately one-sixth the
source ripple.

Comments: Note that the DC load voltage is affected by the unregulated source voltage; if
the unregulated supply were to fluctuate significantly, the regulated voltage would also change.
Thus, one of the effects of the Zener resistance is to cause imperfect regulation. If the Zener
resistance is significantly smaller than both Rs and R;, its effects will not be as pronounced.

Conclusion

This chapter introduces the topic of electronic devices by presenting the semiconductor diode.
Upon completing this chapter, you should have mastered the following learning objectives:

1. Understand the basic principles underlying the physics of semiconductor devices in
general and of the pn junction in particular. Become familiar with the diode equation
and i-v characteristic. Semiconductors have conductive properties that fall between

Part II Electronics

those of conductors and insulators. These properties make the materials useful in the
construction of many electronic devices that exhibit nonlinear i-v characteristics. Of
these devices, the diode is one of the most commonly employed.

Use various circuit models of the semiconductor diode in simple circuits. These are
divided into two classes: the large-signal models, useful to study rectifier circuits, and
the small-signal models, useful in signal processing applications. The semiconductor
diode acts as a one-way current valve, permitting the flow of current only when it is
biased in the forward direction. The behavior of the diode is described by an exponential
equation, but it is possible to approximate the operation of the diode by means of simple
circuit models. The simplest (ideal) model treats the diode either as a short circuit (when
it is forward-biased) or as an open circuit (when it is reverse-biased). The ideal model
can be extended to include an offset voltage, which represents the contact potential at the
diode pn junction. A further model, useful for small-signal circuits, includes a resistance

443

that models the forward resistance of the diode. With the aid of these models it is
possible to analyze diode circuits by using the DC and AC circuit analysis methods of

earlier chapters.

3. Study practical full-wave rectifier circuits and learn to analyze and determine the
practical specifications of a rectifier by using large-signal diode models. One of the most
important properties of the diode is its ability to rectify AC voltages and currents. Diode
rectifiers can be of the half-wave and full-wave types. Full-wave rectifiers can be
constructed in a two-diode configuration or in a four-diode bridge configuration. Diode
rectification is an essential element of DC power supplies. Another important part of a
DC power supply is the filtering, or smoothing, that is usually accomplished by using

capacitors.

4. Understand the basic operation of Zener diodes as voltage references, and use simple
circuit models to analyze elementary voltage regulators. In addition to rectification and
filtering, the power supply requires output voltage regulation. Zener diodes can be used
to provide a voltage reference that is useful in voltage regulators.

APPLICATIONS

hapter 10 continues the discussion of electronic devices that began in Chapter 9

with the semiconductor diode. This chapter describes the operating character-

istics of one of the two major families of electronic devices: bipolar transis-

tors. Chapter 10 is devoted to a brief, qualitative discussion of the physics
and operation of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), which naturally follows the
discussion of the pn junction in Chapter 9. The i-v characteristics of bipolar transis-
tors and their operating states are presented. Large-signal circuit models for the BJT
are then introduced, to illustrate how one can analyze transistor circuits by using basic
circuit analysis methods. A few practical examples are discussed to illustrate the use
of the circuit models.

This chapter introduces the operation of the bipolar junction transistor. Bipolar
transistors represent one of two major families of electronic devices that can serve
as amplifiers and switches. Chapter 10 reviews the operation of the bipolar junction
transistor and presents simple models that permit the analysis and design of simple
amplifier and switch circuits.

10.1 TRANSISTORS AS AMPLIFIERS
AND SWITCHES

A transistor is a three-terminal semiconductor device that can perform two functions
that are fundamental to the design of electronic circuits: amplification and switching.
Put simply, amplification consists of magnifying a signal by transferring energy to
it from an external source, whereas a transistor switch is a device for controlling a
relatively large current between or voltage across two terminals by means of a small
control current or voltage applied at a third terminal. In this chapter, we provide an
introduction to the two major families of transistors: bipolar junction transistors, or
BJTs; and field-effect transistors, or FETs.

The operation of the transistor as a linear amplifier can be explained qualitatively
by the sketch of Figure 10.1, in which the four possible modes of operation of a
transistor are illustrated by means of circuit models employing controlled sources (you
may wish to review the material on controlled sources in Section 2.1). In Figure 10.1,
controlled voltage and current sources are shown to generate an output proportional
to an input current or voltage; the proportionality constant jv is called the internal gain
of the transistor. As will be shown, the BJT acts essentially as a current-controlled
device, while the FET behaves as a voltage-controlled device.

Transistors can also act in a nonlinear mode, as voltage- or current-controlled
switches. When a transistor operates as a switch, a small voltage or current is used to
control the flow of current between two of the transistor terminals in an on/off fashion.
Figure 10.2 depicts the idealized operation of the transistor as a switch, suggesting
that the switch is closed (on) whenever a control voltage or current is greater than
zero and is open (off) otherwise. It will later become apparent that the conditions for
the switch to be on or off need not necessarily be those depicted in Figure 10.2.

Comments: Note that the voltage gain computed above is always less than the transistor
internal voltage gain, 4. One can easily show that if the conditions r; >> Rs andr, < Ry
hold, then the gain of the amplifier becomes approximately equal to the gain of the transistor.
One can therefore conclude that the actual gain of an amplifier always depends on the relative
values of source and input resistance, and of output and load resistance.

10.2 OPERATION OF THE BIPOLAR JUNCTION
TRANSISTOR

The pn junction studied in Chapter 9 forms the basis of a large number of semicon-
ductor devices. The semiconductor diode, a two-terminal device, is the most direct
application of the pn junction. In this section, we introduce the bipolar junction
transistor (BJT). As we did in analyzing the diode, we will introduce the physics
of transistor devices as intuitively as possible, resorting to an analysis of their i-v
characteristics to discover important properties and applications.

Part II Electronics

ABST is formed by joining three sections of semiconductor material, each with
a different doping concentration. The three sections can be either a thin n region
sandwiched between p* and p layers, or a p region between n and n™ layers, where
the superscript plus indicates more heavily doped material. The resulting BJTs are
called pnp and npn transistors, respectively; we discuss only the latter in this chapter.
Figure 10.4 illustrates the approximate construction, symbols, and nomenclature for
the two types of BJTs.

Figure 10.4 Bipolar junction transistors

The operation of the npn BJT may be explained by considering the transistor
as consisting of two back-to-back pn junctions. The base-emitter (BE) junction acts
very much as a diode when it is forward-biased; thus, one can picture the correspond-
ing flow of hole and electron currents from base to emitter when the collector is
open and the BE junction is forward-biased, as depicted in Figure 10.5. Note that the
electron current has been shown larger than the hole current, because of the heavier
doping of the n side of the junction. Some of the electron-hole pairs in the base will
recombine; the remaining charge carriers will give rise to a net flow of current from
base to emitter. It is also important to observe that the base is much narrower than the
emitter section of the transistor.

Imagine, now, reverse-biasing the base-collector (BC) junction. In this case,
an interesting phenomenon takes place: the electrons “emitted” by the emitter with the
BE junction forward-biased reach the very narrow base region, and after a few are lost
to recombination in the base, most of these electrons are “collected” by the collector.
Figure 10.6 illustrates how the reverse bias across the BC junction is in such a direction
as to sweep the electrons from the emitter into the collector. This phenomenon can take
place because the base region is kept particularly narrow. Since the base is narrow,
there is a high probability that the electrons will have gathered enough momentum
from the electric field to cross the reverse-biased collector-base junction and make
it into the collector. The result is that there is a net flow of current from collector to
emitter (opposite in direction to the flow of electrons), in addition to the hole current
from base to emitter. The electron current flowing into the collector through the base
is substantially larger than that which flows into the base from the external circuit.
One can see from Figure 10.6 that if KCL is to be satisfied, we must have

Ip =Ip + Ic

The most important property of the bipolar transistor is that the small base
current controls the amount of the much larger collector current

where £ is a current amplification factor dependent on the physical properties of the
transistor. Typical values of 6 range from 20 to 200. The operation of a pnp transistor
is completely analogous to that of the npn device, with the roles of the charge carriers
(and therefore the signs of the currents) reversed. The symbol for a pnp transistor is
shown in Figure 10.4.

The exact operation of bipolar transistors can be explained by resorting to a
detailed physical analysis of the npn or pnp structure of these devices. The reader
interested in such a discussion of transistors is referred to any one of a number of
excellent books on semiconductor electronics. The aim of this book, however, is to
provide an introduction to the basic principles of transistor operation by means of
simple linear circuit models based on the device i-v characteristic. Although it is
certainly useful for the non-electrical engineer to understand the basic principles of
operation of electronic devices, it is unlikely that most readers will engage in the
design of high-performance electronic circuits or will need a detailed understanding
of the operation of each device. This chapter will therefore serve as a compendium
of the basic ideas, enabling an engineer to read and understand electronic circuit
diagrams and to specify the requirements of electronic instrumentation systems. The
focus of this section will be on the analysis of the i-v characteristic of the npn BJT,
based on the circuit notation defined in Figure 10.7. The device i-v characteristics
will be presented qualitatively, without deriving the underlying equations, and will
be utilized in constructing circuit models for the device.

The number of independent variables required to uniquely define the operation
of the transistor may be determined by applying KVL and KCL to the circuit of
Figure 10.7. Two voltages and two currents are sufficient to specify the operation
of the device. Note that since the BJT is a three-terminal device, it will not be sufficient
to deal with a single i-v characteristic; two such characteristics are required to explain
the operation of this device. One of these characteristics relates the base current, ig to
the base-emitter voltage vgz; the other relates the collector current ic to the collector-
emitter voltage ucg. The latter characteristic actually consists of a family of curves.
To determine these i-v characteristics, consider the i-v curves of Figures 10.8 and
10.9, using the circuit notation of Figure 10.7. In Figure 10.8, the collector is open
and the BE junction is shown to be very similar to a diode. The ideal current source
Tgp injects a base current, which causes the junction to be forward-biased. By varying
Ipg, one can obtain the open-collector BE junction i-v curve shown in the figure.

If a voltage source were now to be connected to the collector circuit, the voltage
Uce and, therefore, the collector current ic could be varied, in addition to the base

current ig. The resulting circuit is depicted in Figure 10.9(a). By varying both the
base current and the collector-emitter voltage, one could then generate a plot of the
device collector characteristic. This is also shown in Figure 10.9(b). Note that this
figure depicts not just a single ic-vcg curve, but an entire family, since for each value
of the base current ig, an ic-Ucg curve can be generated. Four regions are identified
in the collector characteristic:

The cutoff region, where both junctions are reverse-biased, the base
current is very small, and essentially no collector current flows.

The active linear region, in which the transistor can act as a linear
amplifier, where the BE junction is forward-biased and the CB junction is

reverse-biased.

The saturation region, in which both junctions are forward-biased.
The breakdown region, which determines the physical limit of
operation of the device.

From the curves of Figure 10.9(b), we note that as uvcg is increased, the collector
current increases rapidly, until it reaches a nearly constant value; this condition holds
until the collector junction breakdown voltage BVcgo is reached (for the purposes of
this book, we shall not concern ourselves with the phenomenon of breakdown, except
in noting that there are maximum allowable voltages and currents in a transistor). If
we were to repeat the same measurement for a set of different values of ig, the
corresponding value of ic would change accordingly, hence, the family of collector
characteristic curves.

Determining the Operating Region of a BJT

Before we discuss common circuit models for the BJT, it will be useful to consider the
problem of determining the operating region of the transistor. A few simple voltage
measurements permit a quick determination of the state of a transistor placed in a

459

Figure 10.10 Determina-
tion of the operation region of a

Chapter 10 Bipolar Junction Transistors: Operation, Circuit Models, and Applications

circuit. Consider, for example, the BJT described by the curves of Figure 10.9 when
it is placed in the circuit of Figure 10.10. In this figure, voltmeters are used to measure
the value of the collector, emitter, and base voltages. Can these simple measurements
identify the operating region of the transistor? Assume that the measurements reveal
the following conditions:

Vga =Vi =2V Ve = V2 =1.3V Vo =V3=8V

What can be said about the operating region of the transistor?

The first observation is that knowing Vg and Vg permits determination of Vpr :
Vga — Ve = 0.7 V. Thus, we know that the BE junction is forward-biased. Another
quick calculation permits determination of the relationship between base and collector
current: the base current is equal to

_ Vep—Vp 4-2

Ip = = —— = 50 uA
5 Rs 40,000
while the collector current is
Vec — V 12-8
Io = “—_£ = ~_" = 4mA
Rc 1,000
Thus, the current amplification (or gain) factor for the transistor is
Ic
— = 6 = 80
Ip P

Such a value for the current gain suggests that the transistor is in the linear active
region, because substantial current amplification is taking place (typical values of
current gain range from 20 to 200). Finally, the collector-to-emitter voltage Vcg is
found to be Veg = Ve — Ve = 8 — 1.3 = 6.7 V.

At this point, you should be able to locate the operating point of the transistor
on the curves of Figures 10.8 and 10.9. The currents Jg and Jc and the voltage Vcg
uniquely determine the state of the transistor in the [c-Vcg and Ip-Vpr characteristic
curves. What would happen if the transistor were not in the linear active region?
Examples 10.2 and 10.3 answer this question and provide further insight into the
operation of the bipolar transistor.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: Vz, = 0; Vcc = 12 V; Rg = 40 kQ;
Ro = 1kQ; Re = 500 Q.

Part II Electronics 461

Analysis: Since Vgg = 0, the base will be at 0 V, and therefore the base-emitter junction is
reverse-biased and the base current is zero. Thus the emitter current will also be nearly zero.
From equation 10.1 we conclude that the collector current must also be zero. Checking these
observations against Figure 10.9(b) leads to the conclusion that the transistor is in the cutoff
state. In these cases the three voltmeters of Figure 10.10 will read zero for Vg and Vg and
+12 V for Vc, since there is no voltage drop across Rc.

Comments: In general, if the base supply voltage is not sufficient to forward bias the base-
emitter junction, the transistor will be in the cutoff region.

Analysis: To determine the region of the transistor, we shall compute Vgz and Vgc to determine
whether the BE and BC junctions are forward- or reverse-biased. Operation in the saturation Figure 10.11
region corresponds to forward bias at both junctions (and very small voltage drops); operation
in the active region is characterized by a forward-biased BE junction and a reverse-biased BC
junction.

From the available measurements, we compute:

Since both junctions are forward-biased, the transistor is operating in the saturation region.
The value of Vcg = Vc — Ve = 0.3 V is also very small. This is usually a good indication that
the BJT is operating in saturation.

10.3 BJT LARGE-SIGNAL MODEL

The i-v characteristics and the simple circuits of the previous sections indicate that the
BJT acts very much as a current-controlled current source: A small amount of current
injected into the base can cause a much larger current to flow into the collector.
This conceptual model, although somewhat idealized, is useful in describing a large-
signal model for the BJT, that is, a model that describes the behavior of the BJT in the
presence of relatively large base and collector currents, close to the limit of operation
of the device. This model is certainly not a complete description of the properties of
the BJT, nor does it accurately depict all the effects that characterize the operation of
such devices (e.g., temperature effects, saturation, and cutoff); however, it is adequate
for the intended objectives of this book, in that it provides a good qualitative feel for
the important features of transistor amplifiers.

Large-Signal Model of the npn BJT

The large-signal model for the BJT recognizes three basic operating modes of the
transistor. When the BE junction is reverse-biased, no base current (and therefore no
forward collector current) flows, and the transistor acts virtually as an open circuit; the
transistor is said to be in the cutoff region. In practice, there is always a leakage current
flowing through the collector, even when Vgg = 0 and Jz = 0. This leakage current
is denoted by Jcgo. When the BE junction becomes forward-biased, the transistor is
said to be in the active region, and the base current is amplified by a factor of 6 at the
collector:

Ic = Blz (10.3)

Since the collector current is controlled by the base current, the controlled-source
symbol is used to represent the collector current. Finally, when the base current
becomes sufficiently large, the collector-emitter voltage Vcg reaches its saturation
limit, and the collector current is no longer proportional to the base current; this
is called the saturation region. The three conditions are described in Figure 10.12

Figure 10.13.

The large-signal model of the BJT presented in this section treats the BE junction
as an offset diode and assumes that the BJT in the linear active region acts as an ideal

a very useful tool for many applications. Example 10.4 illustrates the application of
this large-signal model in a practical circuit and illustrates how to determine which
of the three states is applicable, using relatively simple analysis.

ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The section on electrical characteristics summarizes some of the important voltage and current specifications
of the transistor. For example, you will find breakdown voltages (not to be exceeded), and cutoff currents. In
this section you also find important modeling information, related to the large-signal model described in this
chapter. The large-signal current gain of the transistor rg or B, is given as a function of collector current. Note
that this parameter varies significantly (from 30 to 100) as the DC collector current varies. Also important are
the CE and BE junction saturation voltages (the batteries in the large-signal model of Figure 10.12).

we calculate a derated power of

The transistor’s ability to dissipate power is determined by its heat transfer properties; the package shown is
the TO-92 package; the SOT-223 and SOT-23 packages have different heat transfer characteristics, leading to
different power dissipation capabilities.

EXAMPLE 10.4 LED Driver Cos

Problem

Design a transistor amplifier to supply a LED. The LED is required to turn on and off follow-
ing the on/off signal from a digital output port of a microcomputer. The circuit is shown in
Figure 10.14.

466 Chapter 10 Bipolar Junction Transistors: Operation, Circuit Models, and Applications

Solution

Known Quantities: Microprocessor output resistance and output signal voltage and current
levels; LED offset voltage, required current, and power rating; BJT current gain and base-
emitter junction offset voltage.

Find: Collector resistance Rc such that the transistor is in the saturation region when the
computer outputs 5 V; power dissipated by LED.

Veomputer Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data:
Microprocessor: output resistance = Rg = 1 kQ; Von = 5 V; Vopzp- =O V3 7 =5 mA.
Transistor: Vcc = 5 V; V, = 0.7 V; B = 95; Vegsa = 0.2 V.

Figure 10.14 LED driver
circuit

Assumptions: Use the large-signal model of Figure 10.12.

Analysis: When the computer output voltage is zero, the BJT is clearly in the cutoff region,
since no base current can flow. When the computer output voltage is Von = 5 V, we wish to drive
the transistor into the saturation region. Recall that operation in saturation corresponds to small
values of collector-emitter voltages, with typical values of Vcg around 0.2 V. Figure 10.15(a)
depicts the equivalent base-emitter circuit when the computer output voltage is Von = 5 V.
Figure 10.15(b) depicts the collector circuit, and Figure 10.15(c), the same collector circuit
with the large-signal model for the transistor (the battery Vcgsa.) in place of the BJT. From this
saturation model we write

Veco = Rclc + Vytep + Veesat
or

R= Veco — Vytep — Versa _ 3.4
c~ Ic Ic

We know that the LED requires at least 15 mA to be on. Let us suppose that 30 mA is a
reasonable LED current to ensure good brightness. Then the value of collector resistance that
would complete our design is, approximately, Rc = 113 Q.

With the above design, the BJT LED driver will clearly operate as intended to turn the
LED on and off. But how do we know that the BJT is in fact in the saturation region? Recall
that the major difference between operation in the active and saturation regions is that in the
active region the transistor displays a nearly constant current gain § while in the saturation

region the current gain is much smaller. Since we know that the nominal 6 for the transistor is
95, we can calculate the base current, using the equivalent base circuit of Figure 10.15(a), and
determine the ratio of base to collector current:

_Vox-Vy _ 4.3

lp = = =43mA
B Rp 1,000 m

The actual large-signal current gain is therefore equal to 30/4.3 = 6.7 < B. Thus, it can be
reasonably assumed that the BJT is operating in saturation.
We finally compute the LED power dissipation:

Since the power rating of the LED has not been exceeded, the design is complete.

Comments: Using the large-signal model of the BJT is quite easy, since the model simply
substitutes voltage sources in place of the BE and CE junctions. To be sure that the correct model
(e.g., saturation versus active region) has been employed, it is necessary to verify either the
current gain or the value of the CE junction voltage. Current gains near the nominal f indicate
active region operation, while small CE junction voltages denote operation in saturation.

Comments: A practical note on NiCd batteries: the standard 9-V NiCd batteries are actually
made of eight 1.2-V cells. Thus the actual nominal battery voltage is 9.6 V. Further, as the
battery becomes fully charged, each cell rises to approximately 1.3 V, leading to a full charge
voltage of 10.4 V.

EXAMPLE 10.6 Simple BJT Motor Drive Circuit ( LO3
Problem

The aim of this example is to design a BJT driver for the Lego® 9V Technic motor, model
43362. Figure 10.17(a) and (b) shows the driver circuit and a picture of the motor. The motor
has a maximum (stall) current of 340 mA. Minimum current to start motor rotation is 20 mA.
The aim of the circuit is to control the current to the motor (and therefore the motor torque,
which is proportional to the current) through potentiometer R).

Assumptions: Assume that the transistors are in the active region. Use the large-signal model
with 6 = 40 for each transistor.

Analysis: The two-transistor configuration shown in Figure 10.17(a) is similar to a Darlington
pair. This configuration is used very often and can be purchased as a single package. The emitter
current from Q, iz: = (6 + 1) ig; becomes the base current for Q2, and therefore,

ic. = Big, = B(B + Via
The Q, base current is given by the expression

current of 340 mA will be obtained when R2 = 0. Thus, we can select a value of R, by choosing
Vcc = 12 V and setting

Since 56 kQ is a standard resistor value, we should select Rj= 56 kQ, which will result in
a slightly lower maximum current. The value of the potentiometer R, can be found from the
minimum current requirement of 20 mA:

Ry = es ) (Vcc — Vy) — Ri = 879,810 Q

Since 1-MQ potentiometers are standard components, we can choose this value for our design,
resulting in a slightly lower minimum current than the specified 20 mA.

Comments: While this design is quite simple, it only permits manual control of the motor cur-
rent (and torque). If we wished to, say, have the motor under computer control, we would need
a circuit that could respond to an external voltage. This design is illustrated in the homework
problems.

By appropriate choice of Ipg, Rc
and Vcc, the desired Q point may
be selected.

10.4 Selecting an Operating Point for a BUT

The family of curves shown for the collector i-v characteristic in Figure 10.9(b)
reflects the dependence of the collector current on the base current. For each value of
the base current ig, there exists a corresponding ic-vcg curve. Thus, by appropriately
selecting the base current and collector current (or collector-emitter voltage), we can
determine the operating point, or Q point, of the transistor. The Q point of a device
is defined in terms of the quiescent (or idle) currents and voltages that are present
at the terminals of the device when DC supplies are connected to it. The circuit
of Figure 10.18 illustrates an ideal DC bias circuit, used to set the Q point of the
BJT in the approximate center of the collector characteristic. The circuit shown in
Figure 10.18 is not a practical DC bias circuit for a BJT amplifier, but it is very
useful for the purpose of introducing the relevant concepts. A practical bias circuit is
discussed later in this section.

Applying KVL around the base-emitter and collector circuits, we obtain the
following equations:

which can be rewritten as

ex Voc — Vee (10.6)
Rc

Note the similarity of equation 10.6 to the load-line curves of Chapters 3 and 9.
Equation 10.6 represents a line that intersects the I¢ axis at Ic = Vcc/Rc and the Vcg
axis at Vcg = Vcc. The slope of the load line is —1/Rc. Since the base current Ig is
equal to the source current Jpg, the operating point may be determined by noting that
the load line intersects the entire collector family of curves. The intersection point
at the curve that corresponds to the base current Jz = Igg constitutes the operating,
or Q, point. The load line corresponding to the circuit of Figure 10.18 is shown in
Figure 10.19, superimposed on the collector curves for the 2N3904 transistor. In
Figure 10.19, Vec = 15 V, Vec/Rc = 40 mA, and Jpg = 150 A; thus, the Q point is
determined by the intersection of the load line with the /¢-Vcg curve corresponding
to a base current of 150 WA.

Once an operating point is established and direct currents [cg and [gg are flowing
into the collector and base, respectively, the BJT can serve as a linear amplifier, as was
explained in Section 10.2. Example 10.7 serves as an illustration of the DC biasing
procedures just described.

Assumptions: The transistor is in the active state.

Analysis: Write the load-line equation for the collector circuit:
Vee = Vec — Rclc = 15 — 375I¢

The load line is shown in Figure 10.19; to determine the Q point, we need to determine which of
the collector curves intersects the load line; that is, we need to know the base current. Applying
KVL around the base circuit, and assuming that the BE junction is forward-biased (this results
from the assumption that the transistor is in the active region), we get

he _ - = 150 pA

The intersection of the load line with the 150-yA base curve is the DC operating or quiescent
point of the transistor amplifier, defined below by the three values:

Vcro =7V Icg = 22 mA Ipg = 150 wA

Comments: The base circuit consists of a battery in series with a resistance; we shall soon see
that it is not necessary to employ two different voltage supplies for base and collector circuits,
but that a single collector supply is sufficient to bias the transistor. Note that even in the absence
of an external input to be amplified (AC source), the transistor dissipates power; most of the
power is dissipated by the collector circuit: Peg = Vceg x Icg = 154 mW.

CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

How would the Q point change if the base current increased to 200 “A?

Wu Te = OLA py & OY vJOMSUY

How can a transistor amplify a signal, then, given the Vgr-7z and Vcg-Ic curves
discussed in this section? The small-signal amplifier properties of the transistor are
best illustrated by analyzing the effect of a small sinusoidal current superimposed
on the DC flowing into the base. The circuit of Figure 10.21 illustrates the idea, by
including a small-signal AC source, of strength AVg, in series with the base circuit.
The effect of this AC source is to cause sinusoidal oscillations AJg about the Q point,
that is, around Jgg. A study of the collector characteristic indicates that for a sinusoidal
oscillation in Jp, a corresponding, but larger oscillation will take place in the collector
current. Figure 10.22 illustrates the concept. Note that the base current oscillates
between 110 and 190 A, causing the collector current to correspondingly fluctuate
between 15.3 and 28.6 mA. The notation that will be used to differentiate between DC
and AC (or fluctuating) components of transistor voltages and currents is as follows:
DC (or quiescent) currents and voltages will be denoted by uppercase symbols, for
example, Ip, Ic, Vaz, Vcr. AC components will be preceded by a A: Alp(t), Alc (t),
AVpr(t), AVce(t). The complete expression for one of these quantities will therefore

include both a DC term and a time-varying, or AC, term. For example, the collector
current may be expressed by ic(t) = Ic + Alc (ft).

The i-v characteristic of Figure 10.22 illustrates how an increase in collector
current follows the same sinusoidal pattern of the base current but is greatly amplified.
Thus, the BJT acts as a current amplifier, in the sense that any oscillations in the base
current appear amplified in the collector current. Since the voltage across the collector
resistance Rc is proportional to the collector current, one can see how the collector
voltage is also affected by the amplification process. Example 10.8 illustrates numer-
ically the effective amplification of the small AC signal that takes place in the circuit
of Figure 10.21.

With reference to the BJT amplifier of Figure 10.23 and to the collector characteristic curves
of Figure 10.19, determine (1) the DC operating point of the BJT, (2) the nominal current gain
f at the operating point, and (3) the AC voltage gain Ay = AV,/AVsz.

Solution

Known Quantities: Base, collector, and emitter resistances; base and collector supply volt-
ages; collector characteristic curves; BE junction offset voltage.

Find: (1) DC (quiescent) base and collector currents Igg and Icg and collector-emitter voltage

Analysis:

1. DC operating point. On the assumption the BE junction resistance is much smaller than

Rz, we can state that the junction voltage is constant, vge(t) = Vazo = V,, and plays a
role only in the DC circuit. The DC equivalent circuit for the base is shown in Figure 10.24

Vep = Relgo + Vero
from which we compute the quiescent base current:

To determine the DC operating point, we write the load-line equation for the collector
circuit:
The load line is shown in Figure 10.25. The intersection of the load line with the 150-A

base curve is the DC operating or quiescent point of the transistor amplifier, defined below
by the three values Vczg = 7.2 V, Icg = 22 mA, and Igg = 150 WA.

Figure 10.25 Operating point on the characteristic curve

2. AC gain. To determine the current gain, we resort, again, to the collector curves.

Figure 10.25 indicates that if we consider the values corresponding to base currents of
190 and 110 wA, the collector will see currents of 28.6 and 15.3 mA, respectively. We can
think of these collector current excursions AJ¢ from the Q point as corresponding to the
effects of an oscillation A/Jg in the base current, and we can calculate the current gain of
the BJT amplifier according to

Alc _ 28.6 x 107° — 15.3 x 107°

p Alp 190 x 10-6 — 110 x 10-6 66.25

Thus, the nominal current gain of the transistor is approximately 6 = 166.

3. AC voltage gain. To determine the AC voltage gain Ay = AV,/AVs3, we need to express

AV, as a function of AVz. Observe that v,(t) = Rcic(t) = Rclco + Rc Alc (t). Thus we
can write:

AV, (t) = —Rc Alc(t) = —RcB Alz(t)

Using the principle of superposition in considering the base circuit, we observe that AJz (ft)
can be computed from the KVL base equation

AVp(t) = Rg Alg(t) + AVae(t)

Part II Electronics

but we had stated in part 1 that since the BE junction resistance is negligible relative to
Rg, AVze(t) is also negligible. Thus,

Substituting this result into the expression for AV,(t), we can write

or

Comments: The circuit examined in this example is not quite a practical transistor amplifier
yet, but it demonstrates most of the essential features of BJT amplifiers. We summarize them
as follows.

* Transistor amplifier analysis is greatly simplified by considering the DC bias circuit
and the AC equivalent circuits separately. This is an application of the principle of
superposition.

* Once the bias point (or DC operating or quiescent point) has been determined, the
current gain of the transistor can be determined from the collector characteristic
curves. This gain is somewhat dependent on the location of the operating point.

* The AC voltage gain of the amplifier is strongly dependent on the base and collector
resistance values. Note that the AC voltage gain is negative! This corresponds to a
180° phase inversion if the signal to be amplified is a sinusoid.

Many issues remain to be considered before we can think of designing and analyzing a practical
transistor amplifier. It is extremely important that you master this example before studying the
remainder of the section.

In discussing the DC biasing procedure for the BJT, we pointed out that the
simple circuit of Figure 10.18 would not be a practical one to use in an application

(operating) point is not very stable. This latter point may be made clearer by pointing
out that the location of the operating point could vary significantly if, say, the current
gain of the transistor 6 were to vary from device to device. A circuit that provides
great improvement on both counts is shown in Figure 10.26. Observe, first, that the

Figure 10.27(b) by the equivalent circuit composed of Vgg and Rp.

Recalling that the BE junction acts much as a diode, we note that the following
equations describe the DC operating point of the self-bias circuit. Around the base-
emitter circuit,

Vee = [pRp + Veg + TeRe = [Re + (8 + L)ReVB + Vee (10.9)

where Vp, is the BE junction voltage (diode forward voltage) and Jz = (6 + I)Jp.
Around the collector circuit, on the other hand, the following equation applies:

+1
Veo = IcRc + Vee + IeRe = Ic (Re + p Rr) + Vcr (10.10)

since

These two equations may be solved to obtain (1) an expression for the base current

for the collector-emitter voltage

The material presented in this section has illustrated the basic principles that
underlie the operation of a BJT and the determination of its Q point.

10.5 BJT SWITCHES AND GATES

In describing the properties of transistors, it was suggested that, in addition to serving
as amplifiers, three-terminal devices can be used as electronic switches in which one
terminal controls the flow of current between the other two. It had also been hinted in
Chapter 9 that diodes can act as on/off devices as well. In this section, we discuss the
operation of diodes and transistors as electronic switches, illustrating the use of these
electronic devices as the switching circuits that are at the heart of analog and digital
gates. Transistor switching circuits form the basis of digital logic circuits, which are
discussed in greater detail in Chapter 12. The objective of this section is to discuss the
internal operation of these circuits and to provide the reader interested in the internal
workings of digital circuits with an adequate understanding of the basic principles.

An electronic gate is a device that, on the basis of one or more input signals,
produces one of two or more prescribed outputs; as will be seen shortly, one can con-
struct both digital and analog gates. A word of explanation is required, first, regarding
the meaning of the words analog and digital. An analog voltage or current—or, more
generally, an analog signal—is one that varies in a continuous fashion over time, in
analogy (hence the expression analog) with a physical quantity. An example of an
analog signal is a sensor voltage corresponding to ambient temperature on any given
day, which may fluctuate between, say, 30 and 50°F. A digital signal, on the other
hand, is a signal that can take only a finite number of values; in particular, a com-
monly encountered class of digital signals consists of binary signals, which can take
only one of two values (for example, 1 and 0). A typical example of a binary signal
would be the control signal for the furnace in a home heating system controlled by a
conventional thermostat, where one can think of this signal as being “on” (or 1) if the
temperature of the house has dropped below the thermostat setting (desired value),
or “off” (or 0) if the house temperature is greater than or equal to the set temperature
(say, 68°F). Figure 10.28 illustrates the appearance of the analog and digital signals
in this furnace example.

The discussion of digital signals will be continued and expanded in Chapter 12.
Digital circuits are an especially important topic, because a large part of today’s
industrial and consumer electronics is realized in digital form.

Part II Electronics

Diode Gates

You will recall that a diode conducts current when it is forward-biased and otherwise
acts very much as an open circuit. Thus, the diode can serve as a switch if properly
employed. The circuit of Figure 10.29 is called an OR gate; it operates as follows. Let
voltage levels greater than, say, 2 V correspond to a “logic 1” and voltages less than
2 V represent a “logic 0.” Suppose, then, that input voltages v4 and vg can be equal
to either 0 V or 5 V. If v4 = 5 V, diode Dy will conduct; if v4 = 0 V, Dy will act as an
open circuit. The same argument holds for Dg. It should be apparent, then, that the
voltage across the resistor R will be 0 V, or logic 0, if both v4 and vgx are 0. If either v4
or ug is equal to 5 V, though, the corresponding diode will conduct, and—assuming
an offset model for the diode with V, = 0.6 V—we find that v,,, = 4.4 V, or logic I.
Similar analysis yields an equivalent result if both v4 and ug are equal to 5 V.

This type of gate is called an OR gate because v,,, is equal to logic | (or “high’”)
if either v4 or vg is on, while it is logic 0 (or “low’”) if neither vg nor vg is on. Other
functions can also be implemented; however, the discussion of diode gates will be
limited to this simple introduction, because diode gate circuits, such as the one of
Figure 10.29, are rarely, if ever, employed in practice. Most modern digital circuits
employ transistors to implement switching and gate functions.

BJT Gates

In discussing large-signal models for the BJT, we observed that the i-v characteristic
of this family of devices includes a cutoff region, where virtually no current flows
through the transistor. On the other hand, when a sufficient amount of current is
injected into the base of the transistor, a bipolar transistor will reach saturation, and a
substantial amount of collector current will flow. This behavior is quite well suited to
the design of electronic gates and switches and can be visualized by superimposing
a load line on the collector characteristic, as shown in Figure 10.30.

The operation of the simple BJT switch is illustrated in Figure 10.30, by means
of load-line analysis. Writing the load-line equation at the collector circuit, we have

Uce = Vec — icRc (10.13)

and

Vout = VCE (10.14)

Thus, when the input voltage v;, is low (say, 0 V), the transistor is in the cutoff region
and little or no current flows, and

Vout = Vcr = Voc (10.15)

so that the output is “logic high.”

When 1;, is large enough to drive the transistor into the saturation region, a sub-
stantial amount of collector current will flow and the collector-emitter voltage will
be reduced to the small saturation value Vega, which is typically a fraction of a volt.
This corresponds to the point labeled B on the load line. For the input voltage v;, to
drive the BJT of Figure 10.30 into saturation, a base current of approximately 50 wA
will be required. Suppose, then, that the voltage v;, could take the values 0 or 5 V.
Then if v;, = 0 V, vu, will be nearly equal to Vcc, or, again, 5 V. If, on the other
hand, v;, = 5 V and Rz is, say, equal to 89 kQ [so that the base current required for
saturation flows into the base: ig = (vin — V,)/Rg = (5 — 0.6)/89,000 © 50 WA],
we have the BJT in saturation, and vox = Versa © 0.2 V.

Thus, you see that whenever v;, corresponds to a logic high (or logic 1), vou
takes a value close to 0 V, or logic low (or 0); conversely, vi, = “O” (logic “low’’)
leads to v,,, = “1.” The values of 5 and 0 V for the two logic levels | and 0 are quite
common in practice and are the standard values used in a family of logic circuits
denoted by the acronym TTL, which stands for transistor-transistor logic.! One
of the more common TTL blocks is the inverter shown in Figure 10.30, so called
because it “inverts” the input by providing a low output for a high input, and vice
versa. This type of inverting, or “negative,” logic behavior is quite typical of BJT
gates (and of transistor gates in general).

In the following paragraphs, we introduce some elementary BJT logic gates,
similar to the diode gates described previously; the theory and application of digital
logic circuits are discussed in Chapter 12. Example 10.10 illustrates the operation of
a NAND gate, that is, a logic gate that acts as an inverted AND gate (thus the prefix
N in NAND, which stands for NOT).

Known Quantities: Resistor values; Vg¢o, and Vegsat for each transistor.
Find: v., for each of the four combinations of v; and v>.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: R, = 5.7 kQ; Ry = 2.2 kQ;
R3 = 2.2 kQ; Ry = 1.8 kQ; Veo = 5 V3 Veen = Vy = 0.7 V3 Veesat = 0.2 V.

Assumptions: Treat the BE and BC junctions of Q, as offset diodes. Assume that the transistors
are in saturation when conducting.

Analysis: The inputs to the TTL gate, v; and v2, are applied to the emitter of transistor Q;. The
transistor is designed so as to have two emitter circuits in parallel. Transistor Q; is modeled by
the offset diode model, as shown in Figure 10.32. We now consider each of the four cases.

1. v; = vo = 0 V. With the emitters of Q; connected to ground and the base of Q at 5 V, the
BE junction will clearly be forward-biased and Q, is on. This result means that the base
current of Q> (equal to the collector current of Q,) is negative, and therefore Q must be
off. If Q> is off, its emitter current must be zero, and therefore no base current can flow

ITTL logic values are actually quite flexible, with vyicu as low as 2.4 V and viow as high as 0.4 V.

into Q3, which is in turn also off. With Q3 off, no current flows through R3, and therefore
Vout = 5 — UR3 = 5 V.

2. v; = 5 V; vy = 0 V. Now, with reference to Figure 10.32, we see that diode D, is still
forward-biased, but D2 is now reverse-biased because of the 5-V potential at v2. Since
one of the two emitter branches is capable of conducting, base current will flow and Q;
will be on. The remainder of the analysis is the same as in case 1, and Q, and Q; will both
be off, leading to voy, = 5 V.

3. vy =0V; v2 = 5 V. By symmetry with case 2, we conclude that, again, one emitter branch
is conducting, and therefore Q, will be on, Q2 and Q3 will both be off, and vou = 5 V.

4. v; =5 V; vo =5 V. When both v; and v2 are at 5 V, diodes D, and D) are both strongly
reverse-biased, and therefore no emitter current can flow. Thus, Q; must be off. Note,
however, that while D,; and D, are reverse-biased, D3 is forward-biased, and therefore a
current will flow into the base of Q,; thus, Q> is on and since the emitter of Q, is connected
to the base of Q3, Q3 will also see a positive base current and will be on. To determine the
output voltage, we assume that Q; is operating in saturation. Then, applying KVL to the
collector circuit, we have

Voc = Ic3R3 + Ves

and

Vout = Veo —IcR3 = 5 —2.2 x 107 x 2.2 x 103 =5—4.84=0.16V

These results are summarized in the next table. The output values are consistent with TTL
logic; the output voltage for case 4 is sufficiently close to zero to be considered zero for logic
purposes.

Comments: While exact analysis of TTL logic gate circuits could be tedious and involved, the
method demonstrated in this example—to determine whether transistors are on or off—leads
to very simple analysis. Since in logic devices one is interested primarily in logic levels and
not in exact values, this approximate analysis method is very appropriate.

Conclusion

This chapter introduces the bipolar junction transistor, and by way of simple circuit model
demonstrates its operation as an amplifier and a switch. Upon completing this chapter, you
should have mastered the following learning objectives:

1.

Understand the basic principles of amplification and switching. Transistors are
three-terminal electronic semiconductor devices that can serve as amplifiers and
switches.

Understand the physical operation of bipolar transistors; determine the operating point
of a bipolar transistor circuit. The bipolar junction transistor has four regions of
operation. These can be readily identified by simple voltage measurements.

Understand the large-signal model of the bipolar transistor, and apply it to simple
amplifier circuits. The large-signal model of the BJT is very easy to use, requiring only a
basic understanding of DC circuit analysis, and can be readily applied to many practical
situations.

Select the operating point of a bipolar transistor circuit. Biasing a bipolar transistor
consists of selecting the appropriate values for the DC supply voltage(s) and for the
resistors that comprise a transistor amplifier circuit. When biased in the forward active
region, the bipolar transistor acts as a current-controlled current source, and can amplify
small currents injected into the base by as much as a factor of 200.

Understand the operation of a bipolar transistor as a switch and analyze basic analog
and digital gate circuits. The operation of a BJT as a switch is very straightforward, and
consists of designing a transistor circuit that will go from cutoff to saturation when an
input voltage changes from a high to a low value, or vice versa. Transistor switches are
commonly used to design digital logic gates.

FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS:
OPERATION, CIRCUIT MODELS,
AND APPLICATIONS

hapter 11 introduces the family of field-effect transistors, or FETs. The concept

that forms the basis of the operation of the field-effect transistor is that an exter-

nal electric field may be used to vary the conductivity of a channel, causing the

FET to behave either as a voltage-controlled resistor or as a voltage-controlled
current source.

FETs are the dominant transistor family in today’s integrated electronics, and
although these transistors come in several different configurations, it is possible to
understand the operation of the different devices by focusing principally on one type.

In this chapter we focus on the basic operation of the enhancement-mode, metal-
oxide-semiconductor FET, leading to the technologies that are commonly known as
NMOS, PMOS, and CMOS. The chapter reviews the operation of these devices as
large-signal amplifiers and as switches.

CLASSIFICATION OF FIELD-EFFECT
TRANSISTORS

11.1

Figure 11.1 depicts the classification of field-effect transistors, as well as the more
commonly used symbols for these devices. These devices can be grouped into three
major categories. The first two categories are both types of metal-oxide semicon-
ductor field-effect transistors, or MOSFETs: enhancement-mode MOSFETs and
depletion-mode MOSFETs. The third category consists of junction field-effect
transistors, or JFETs. In addition, each of these devices can be fabricated either as
an n-channel device or as a p-channel device, where the n or p designation indicates
the nature of the doping in the semiconductor channel. All these transistors behave in
a very similar fashion, and we shall predominantly discuss enhancement MOSFETs
in this chapter, although a brief discussion of depletion devices and JFETs is also
included.

11.2 OVERVIEW OF ENHANCEMENT-MODE
MOSFETS

Figure 11.2 depicts the circuit symbol and the approximate construction of a typical
n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET. The device has three terminals: the gate
(analogous to the base in a BJT), the drain (analogous to the collector), and the
source (analogous to the emitter). The bulk or substrate of the device is shown
to be electrically connected to the source, and therefore it does not appear in the
electric circuit diagram as a separate terminal. The gate consists of a metal film layer,
separated from the p-type bulk by a thin oxide layer (hence the terminology metal-
oxide semiconductor). The drain and source are both constructed of n* material.
Imagine now that the drain is connected to a positive voltage supply Vpp, and
the source is connected to ground. Since the p-type bulk is connected to the source, and
hence to ground, the drain-bulk n*p junction is strongly reverse-biased. The junction
voltage for the pn* junction formed by the bulk and the source is zero, since both
are connected to ground. Thus, the path between drain and source consists of two
reverse-biased pn junctions, and no current can flow. This situation is depicted in
Figure 11.3(a): in the absence of a gate voltage, the n-channel enhancement-mode
MOSFET acts as an open circuit. Thus, enhancement-mode devices are normally off.
Suppose now that a positive voltage is applied to the gate; this voltage will create
an electric field in the direction shown in Figure 11.3(b). The effect of the electric

field is to repel positive charge carriers away from the surface of the p-type bulk,
and to form a narrow channel near the surface of the bulk in which negative charge
carriers dominate and are available for conduction. For a fixed drain bias, the greater
the strength of the externally applied electric field (i.e., the higher the gate voltage),
the higher the concentration of carriers in the channel, and the higher its conductivity.
This behavior explains the terminology enhancement mode, because the application
of an external electric field enhances the conduction in the channel by creating n-type
charge carriers. It should also be clear why these devices are called field-effect, since it
is an external electric field that determines the conduction properties of the transistor.

It is also possible to create depletion-mode devices in which an externally
applied field depletes the channel of charge carriers by reducing the effective channel
width. Depletion-mode MOSFETs are normally on, and they can be turned off by
application of an external electric field.

To complete this brief summary of the operation of MOS transistors, we note
that, in analogy with pnp bipolar transistors, it is also possible to construct p-channel
MOSFETs. In these transistors, conduction occurs in a channel formed in n-type bulk
material via positive charge carriers.

We first define a few key parameters that generally apply to enhancement-mode
and depletion-mode and to n-channel as well as p-channel devices.

Chapter 11 Field-effect Transistors: Operation, Circuit Models, and Applications

Threshold Voltage, Vr

When the gate-to-substrate voltage is greater than the threshold voltage, a conducting
channel is formed through the creation of a layer of free electrons. In enhancement-
mode devices, the threshold voltage is positive. If at any location between the source
and drain regions of the transistor the gate-to-substrate voltage is greater than the
threshold voltage, then the channel is said to be on at that point. Otherwise the channel
is off, and no current can flow.

In depletion-mode devices, a conducting n-type channel is built into the device
by design, and a negative gate-to-substrate voltage is used to turn the channel off
(depleting the n-type channel of electrons—hence the name depletion mode). We
shall not discuss depletion-mode devices any further in this book.

Conductance Parameter K

The ability of the channel to conduct is dependent on different mechanisms, which
are captured in a conductance parameter K, defined as
WHC
L 2
In equation 11.1, W represents the width of the channel, L represents the length, ju is
the mobility of the charge carrier (electrons in n-channel devices, holes in p-channel
devices), and C,, is the capacitance of the oxide layer.

(11.1)

Early Voltage Vz

This parameter describes the dependence on ups of the MOSFET drain current in the
saturation region. It is common to assume that V4 approaches infinity, indicating that
the drain current is independent of ups. The role of this parameter will become more
obvious in the next section.

Operation of the n-Channel Enhancement-Mode
MOSFET

We first focus on n-channel enhancement-mode transistors, which are generally
referred to as NMOS devices. The operation of these devices is most effectively
explained by making reference to the four-quadrant plot of Figure 11.4. In this figure,
the behavior of the NMOS device is tied to whether the channel is on or off at the
source or drain end of the transistor. Recall that whenever the gate-to-substrate voltage
is higher than the threshold voltage, the channel is on.

Cutoff Region

When both vgs < Vr and vgp < Vr, the channel is off at both the source and the drain.
Thus, there is no conduction region between drain and source, and no current can be
conducted. We call this the cutoff region, indicated in Figure 11.4 by region 1. In this
region,

ip =0 Cutoff region (11.2)

Saturation Region

When ugs > Vz, and vgp < Vr, the channel is on at the source end and off at the
drain. In this mode, the drain current is (very nearly) independent of the

Part II Electronics

drain-to-source voltage ups and depends on only the gate voltage. We call this the
saturation region, indicated in Figure 11.4 by region 2. In this region, the MOSFET
acts as a voltage-controlled current source. The equation for the drain current is
given in equation 11.3. Note that in the more complete form of the equation, both the
parameter V4 and the drain-to-source voltage vps appear. If, as is commonly done,
we assume that V4 is very large, then we can use the approximate form, also shown
below, which is independent of ups.

Ups

ip = K(ugs — Vr)* (1 + ee

Va Saturation region (11.3)

~ K(vgs — Vr)?

Triode or Ohmic Region

When vgs > Vr and vgp > Vr, the channel is on at both ends of the device. In this
mode, the drain current is strongly dependent on both the drain-to-source voltage ups
and the gate-to-source voltage vgs. We call this the triode or ohmic region, indicated
in Figure 11.4 by region 3. The equation for the drain current is

ip = K[2(vgs — Vr)ups — Ups] Triode or ohmic region (11.4)

If vps is much smaller than vgs, then vgp = vgs — Ups © vcs. Thus, for small values
of ups (see the drain characteristic curves in Figure 11.5), the channel is approximately
equally on at both the drain and the source end. Thus, changes in the gate voltage will
directly affect the conductivity of the channel. In this mode, the MOSFET behaves
very much as a voltage-controlled resistor that is controlled by the gate voltage. This
property finds much use in integrated circuits, in that it is easier to implement an
integrated-circuit version of a resistor through a MOSFET than to actually build a
passive resistor. There also exist other applications of the voltage-controlled resistor
property of MOSFETs in tunable (variable-gain) amplifiers and in analog gates.
The three regions of operation can also be identified in the drain characteristic
curves shown in Figure 11.5. In this figure, the circuit of Figure 11.3(b) is used to
vary the gate and drain voltages with respect to the source and substrate (which are
assumed to be electrically connected). You can see that for vgs < Vr and uvgp < Vr, the
transistor is in the cutoff region (1) and no drain current flows. To better understand
the difference between the saturation and triode (or ohmic) regions of operation, the
boundary between these two regions is shown in Figure 11.5 by the curve ip = K Uns.
You can see that in the saturation region (2), the transistor supplies nearly constant
drain current, the value of which is dependent on the square of the gate-to-source
voltage. Thus, in this region the MOSFET operates as a voltage-controlled current
source, and it can be used in a variety of amplifier applications. On the other hand,
in the triode region (3), the drain current is very strongly dependent on both the
gate-to-source and the drain-to-source voltages (see equation 11.4). If, however, ups
is much smaller than vgs, then vgn = vgs + Ups © ves, and the channel is on
equally, or very nearly so, at both the source and drain ends. This corresponds to the
region near the origin in the curves of Figure 11.5, in which the drain current curves
are nearly straight lines. In this portion of the triode region, the MOSFET acts as a
variable resistor, with resistance (i.e., the reciprocal of the slope in the ip — vps curves)
controlled by the gate-to-source voltage. As mentioned earlier, this variable resistor
characteristic of MOSFETs is widely exploited in integrated circuits. Finally, if the
drain-to-source voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage Voss, the drain current will

a. Since the drain current is zero, the MOSFET is in the cutoff region. You should verify that
both the conditions vgs < Vr and vgp < Vr are satisfied.

In this case, vgs = Veg = 4 V > Vr. On the other hand, vgp = vg — vp = 4— 2.8 =
1.2 V < Vr. Thus, the transistor is in the saturation region. We can calculate the drain
current to be: ip = K(vgs — Vr)? = 18 x (4— 2)? = 72 mA. Alternatively, we can also

11.3. BIASING MOSFET CIRCUITS

Now that we have analyzed the basic characteristics of MOSFETs of the n-channel
enhancement MOSFET and can identify its operating state, we are ready to develop
systematic procedures for biasing a MOSFET circuit. This section presents two bias
circuits. The first, illustrated in Examples 11.2 and 11.3, uses two distinct voltage
supplies. This bias circuit is easier to understand, but not very practical—as we have
already seen with BJTs, it is preferable to have a single DC voltage supply. This desire
is addressed by the second bias circuit, described in Examples 11.4 and 11.5.

Find: MOSFET quiescent drain current ipg and quiescent drain-source voltage vpso.
Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: Vgc = 2.4 V; Vpp = 10 V; Rp = 100 Q.
Assumptions: Use the drain curves of Figure 11.7.

Analysis: To determine the Q point, we write the drain circuit equation, applying KVL:

Vpp = Roip + Ups

10 = 100ip + Ups
The resulting curve is plotted as a dashed line on the drain curves of Figure 11.7 by noting that
the drain current axis intercept is equal to Vpp/Rp = 100 mA and that the drain-source voltage

axis intercept is equal to Vpp = 10 V. The Q point is then given by the intersection of the load
line with the Vgg = 2.4 V curve. Thus, ipg = 52 mA and upsg = 4.75 V.

Comments: Note that the Q-point determination for a MOSFET is easier than for a BJT, since
there is no need to consider the gate circuit, because gate current flow is essentially zero. In
the case of the BJT, we also needed to consider the base circuit.

Assumptions: Use the MOSFET equations 11.2 through 11.4 as needed.

Analysis: The gate supply Vgc ensures that vgsg = Voc = 2.4 V. Thus, vgso > Vr. We
assume that the MOSFET is in the saturation region, and we proceed to use equation 11.3 to
calculate the drain current:

ing = K (ves — Vr) = 48.5(2.4 — 1.4) = 48.5 mA
Applying KVL to the drain loop, we can calculate the quiescent drain-to-source voltage as:
vpso = Vop — Rpipg = 10 — 100 x 48.5 x 10°77 = 5.15 V

Now we can verify the assumption that the MOSFET was operating in the saturation region.
Recall that the conditions required for operation in region 2 (saturation) were vgs > Vr and
Uap < Vr. The first condition is clearly satisfied. The second can be verified by recognizing that
Ugp = Ves + Usp = UGs — Ups = —2.75 V. Clearly, the condition vgp < Vr is also satisfied,
and the MOSFET is indeed operating in the saturation region.

Assumptions: Assume operation in the saturation region.

Analysis: First we reduce the circuit of Figure 11.8(a) to the circuit of Figure 11.8(b), in which
the voltage divider rule has been used to compute the value of the fictitious supply Veg:

Veo = —2—Vpp = 15 V
C6 Ri +Rs DD =

Let all currents be expressed in milliamperes and all resistances in kilohms. Applying KVL
around the equivalent gate circuit of Figure 11.8(b) yields

veso + icaRg + inoRs = Veg = 15 V

where Rg = Rj||Ro. Since igg = 0, due to the infinite input resistance of the MOSFET, the
gate equation simplifies to

veso + ipopRs = 15 V (a)
The drain circuit equation is

Upso + ipeRp + ipoRs = Vpp = 30 V (b)
Using equation 11.3, we get

ing = K(ves — Vr)” (©)

We can obtain the third equation needed to solve for the three unknowns vgsg, ing, and upso-
From equation (a) we write

Substituting the previous equation for ipg into equation (c), we finally obtain a quadratic
equation that can be solved for vgsg since we know the desired value of upso:

Véso — (2¥, + mm) vgso + Vz — me (@ - vs) =0
Vgéso — 8.457veso + 12.8 = 0
The two solutions for the above quadratic equation are
Ugso = 6.48 V and Vgso = 1.97 V

Only the first of these two values is acceptable for operation in the saturation region, since the
second root corresponds to a value of vgs lower than the threshold voltage (recall that Vr =
4 V). Substituting the first value into equation (c), we can compute the quiescent drain current

ing = 1.35 mA

Using this value in the gate circuit equation (a), we compute the solution for the source
resistance:

Rs = 6.32kQ

Comments: Why are there two solutions to the problem posed in this example? Mathemati-
cally, we know that this should be the case because the drain universal equation is a quadratic
equation. As you can see, we used the physical constraints of the problem to select the appro-
priate solution.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: R, = Ry = 1 MQ; Rp = 6 kQ;
Rs =6kQ: Vpp = 10 V; Vr = 1 V; K = 0.5 mA/V?.

Assumptions: The MOSFET is operating in the saturation region. All currents are expressed
in milliamperes and all resistors in kilohms.

Analysis: The gate voltage is computed by applying the voltage divider rule between resistors
R, and R, (remember that no current flows into the transistor):

Ry

Ug = ——_
oR +R)

Vop = 7 Vo =5V

Assuming saturation region operation, we write
Ucgs = Ug — Vs = UG — Rsip = 5 — Oip
The drain current can be computed from equation 11.3:
ip = K (vgs — Vr)” = 0.5 (5 — Gin — 1)?
leading to
3617, — S0ip + 16 = 0
with solutions

ip = 0.89 mA and ip = 0.5 mA

To determine which of the two solutions should be chosen, we compute the gate-source voltage
for each. For ip = 0.89 mA, vgs = 5 — 6ip = —0.34 V. For ip = 0.5 mA, vgs = 5 — 6ip =
2 V. Since vgs must be greater than V; for the MOSFET to be in the saturation region, we
select the solution

ip = 0.5 mA Ugs =2V

The corresponding drain voltage is therefore found to be
Up = Upp — Rpip = 10 — bip = 7 V

And therefore
Ups = Up — Vs = Vp — ipRs = 7-3 =4V

Comments: Now that we have computed the desired voltages and current, we can verify that
the conditions for operation in the saturation region are indeed satisfied: ugg = 2 > Vr and
Ugp = VGs — Ups = 2 — 4 = —2 < Vr. Since the inequalities are satisfied, the MOSFET is
indeed operating in the saturation region.

Operation of the P-Channel Enhancement-Mode
MOSFET

The operation of a p-channel enhancement-mode MOS transistor is very similar in
concept to that of an n-channel device. Figure 11.10 depicts a test circuit and a sketch
of the device construction. Note that the roles of n-type and p-type materials are
reversed and that the charge carriers in the channel are no longer electrons, but holes.
Further, the threshold voltage is now negative: Vr < 0. However, if we replace vgs
with vsg, Ugp With upg, and vps with usp, and we use |V7| in place of V7, then the

In particular, Figure 11.11 depicts the behavior of a PMOS transistor in terms of the

equations for the three modes of operation of the PMOS transistor are summarized

11.4 MOSFET LARGE-SIGNAL AMPLIFIERS

The objective of this section is to illustrate how a MOSFET can be used as a large-
signal amplifier, in applications similar to those illustrated in Chapter 10 for bipolar
transistors. Equation 11.3, repeated below for convenience, describes the approxi-
mate relationship between the drain current and gate-source voltage for the MOSFET
in a large-signal amplifier application. Appropriate biasing, as explained in the pre-
ceding section, is used to ensure that the MOSFET is operating in the saturation
mode.

ip X K(vos — Vr)? (11.8)

MOSFET amplifiers are commonly found in one of two configurations: common-
source and source-follower amplifiers. Figure 11.12 depicts a basic common-source
configuration. Note that when the MOSFET is in saturation, this amplifier is essentially
a voltage-controlled current source (VCCS), in which the drain current is controlled

by the gate voltage. Thus, the load voltage, across the load resistance, is given by the
expression

Vioan = Rioapip = RroapK (ves — Vr) = RioanK (Vg — Vr)? (11.9)

A source-follower amplifier is shown in Figure 11.13(a). Note that the load is now
connected between the source and ground. The behavior of this circuit depends on the
load current and can be analyzed for the resistive load of Figure 11.13 by observing
that the load voltage is given by the expression vyoap = Rioapip, where

ip = K(ves — Vr)’ = K(Av — vs) = K(Av — v10ap)* = K (Av — Rioavip)”
(11.10)

and where Av = Vg — Vr. We can then solve for the load current from the quadratic
equation:

ip = K(Av — Rioavip)” = KAv* — 2KAvRioavip + Reoavip

amplifier when the gate voltage varies between the threshold voltage and 5 volts fora

is linear in the gate voltage. This behavior is due to the fact that the source voltage
increases as the drain current increases, since the source voltage is proportional to ip.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data. Figure 11.14(a), (b). Vr = 1.2 V; K =
0.018 mA/V?.

Assumptions: Assume that the MOSFETs are operating in the saturation region.

Analysis:

a.

The conditions for the MOSFET to be in the saturation region are: ugs > Vr and vgp <
Vr. The first condition is satisfied whenever the gate voltage is above 1.2 V. Thus the
transistor will first begin to conduct when Vg = 1.2. Assuming for the moment that
both conditions are satisfied, and that Vpp is sufficiently large, we can calculate the drain
current to be: ip = K(vgs — Vr)? = 0.018 x (vg — 1.2)? A. The plot of Figure 11.14(c)
depicts the battery charging (drain) current as a function of the gate voltage. You can
see that the maximum charging current of 100 mA can be generated with a gate voltage
of approximately 3.5 V. The nonlinear nature of the MOSFET is also clear from the i-v
plot. Let us now determine whether the condition vgp < Vr is also met. The requirement
for the active region is that ups > vgs — Vr, which is the better way to think about it;
however this does indeed translate into ugp < V;. But be careful in interpreting this
last equation. When Vps > Ves — Vr, then Vgp will usually be negative, since the drain
voltage should be larger than the source voltage. This can be easily done if we realize that
UcGp = UG — Up, and that vp = Vpp — Vz, where Vz is the battery voltage. To satisfy the
condition vgp < Vr, solve the following inequality:

Vep < Vr
UG — Up < Vr, which is negative
Up > vg — Vr
Vpp — Vg < vg — Vr, so actually Vpp — Vg > vg — Vr
To ensure that the NMOS remains in the saturation region throughout the range of bat-

tery voltage, we need to make Vpp sufficiently large. In this case Vpp should be larger
than 12 V.

Part II Electronics

b. The analysis of the second circuit is based on the observation that the voltage at the source
terminal of the MOSFET is equal to the gate voltage minus the threshold voltage. If we
wish to charge the battery up to 10.5 V, we need to have a gate voltage of at least 11.7 V,
to satisfy ugs > Vr. If we assume that the battery is initially discharged (9 V), we can
calculate the initial charging current to be

ip = K(vgs — Vr)? = K(Vg — Vg — Vr)? = 0.018 x (11.7 — 9 — 1.2)?
= 0.0405 A

If we further assume that during the charging the battery voltage increases linearly from 9
to 10.5 V over a period of 20 minutes, we can calculate the charging current as the battery
voltage increases. Note that when the battery is fully charged, vgs is no longer larger than
the threshold voltage and the transistor is cut off. A plot of the drain (charging) current as
a function of time is shown in Figure 11.14(d). Note that the charging current naturally
tapers to zero as the battery voltage increases.

Comments: In the circuit of part (b), please note that the battery voltage is not likely to actually
increase linearly. The voltage rise will begin to taper off as the battery begins to approach full
charge. In practice, this means that the charging process will take longer than projected in
Figure 11.14(d).

EXAMPLE 11.7 MOSFET DC Motor Drive Circuit

Problem

The aim of this example is to design a MOSFET driver for the Lego® 9V Technic motor, model
43362. Figures 11.15(a) and (b) show the driver circuit and a picture of the motor, respectively.
The motor has a maximum (stall) current of 340 mA. Minimum current to start motor rotation
is 20 mA. The aim of the circuit is to control the current to the motor (and therefore the motor
torque, which is proportional to the current) via the gate voltage.

Solution
Known Quantities: Transistor large-signal parameters; component values.
Find: Values of R; and Ro.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: Figure 11.15. Vr = 1.2 V; K =
0.08 A/V?.

Assumptions: Assume that the MOSFET is in the saturation region.

Analysis: The conditions for the MOSFET to be in the saturation region are: vgs > Vr and
Ucgp < Vr. The first condition is satisfied whenever the gate voltage is above 1.2 V. Thus the
transistor will first begin to conduct when Vg = 1.2. Assuming for the moment that both con-
ditions are satisfied, and that Vpp is sufficiently large, we can calculate the drain current to be:

ip = K(vgs — Vr)? = 0.08 x (vg — 1.2)°A

The plot of Figure 11.15(c) depicts the DC motor (drain) current as a function of the gate
voltage. You can see that the maximum current of 340 mA can be generated with a gate voltage
of approximately 3.3 V. It would take approximately 1.5 V at the gate to generate the minimum
required current of 20 mA.

Comments: This circuit could be quite easily implemented in practice to drive the motor
with a signal from a microcontroller. In practice, instead of trying to output an analog voltage,

11.5 MOSFET SWITCHES

The objective of this section is to illustrate how a MOSFET can be used as an analog
or a digital switch (or gate). Most MOSFET switches make use of a particular tech-
nology known as complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or CMOS. CMOS
technology makes use of the complementary characteristics of PMOS and NMOS
devices and leads to the design of integrated circuits with extremely low power con-
sumption. Further, CMOS circuits are easily fabricated and require a single supply
voltage, which is a significant advantage.

Digital Switches and Gates

To explain CMOS technology, we make reference to the CMOS inverter of
Figure 11.16, in which two p-channel and n-channel enhancement-mode devices
are connected so as to have a single supply voltage (Vpp, relative to ground) and so
that their gates are tied together. The p-channel transistor is shown on the top and
the n-channel device on the bottom in Figure 11.16. Functionally, this device is an
inverter in the sense that whenever the input voltage v;, is logic high, or | (1.e., near
Vpp), then the output voltage is logic low (or 0). If the input is logic 0, on the other
hand, then the output will be logic 1.

The operation of the inverter is as follows. When the input voltage is high
(near Vpp), then the gate-to-source voltage for the p-channel transistor is near zero
and the PMOS transistor operates in the cutoff region. Thus, no drain current flows
through the top transistor, and it is off, acting as an open circuit. On the other hand,
with v;, near Vpp, the bottom transistor sees a large gate-to-source voltage and will
turn on, resulting in a small resistance between the v,,, terminal and ground. Thus,
if vi, is “high,” vou will by necessity be “low.” This is illustrated in the simplified
sketch of Figure 11.17(a), in which the PMOS transistor is approximated by an open
switch (to signify the off condition) and the NMOS transistor is shown as a closed
switch to denote its on condition. When the input voltage is low (near 0 V), then
the PMOS transistor will see a large negative gate-to-source voltage and will turn
on; on the other hand, the gate-to-source voltage for the NMOS will be near zero,
and the lower transistor will be off. This is illustrated in Figure 11.17(b), using ideal

switches to approximate the individual transistors. Note that this simple logic inverter
does not require the use of any resistors to bias the transistors: it is completely self-
contained and very easy to fabricate. Further, itis also characterized by very low power
consumption, making it ideal for many portable consumer electronic applications.
Examples 11.8 and 11.9 illustrate a number of digital switch and gate appli-
cations of MOS technology. Example 11.8 explores a NMOS switch using the drain

is in the saturation region. The Q point is

UGso = OV ipa = 60mA Upso = 2.5 V
This result satisfies the drain equation, since Rpip = 0.06 x 125 = 7.5 V.

conducting 60 mA when the gate voltage is switched to 2.5 V.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: V; = 1.7 V; Vpp =5 V.

Assumptions: Treat the MOSFETs as open circuits when off and as linear resistors when on.
Analysis:

1. vy = vo = 0 V. With both input voltages equal to zero, neither M3 nor M, can conduct,
since the gate voltage is less than the threshold voltage for both transistors. Both M, and
M), will similarly be off, and no current will flow through the drain-source circuits of M,
and M>. Thus, vou = Vop = 5 V. This condition is depicted in Figure 11.21.

2. v; = 5 V; v2 = 0 V. Now M, and My, are off because of the zero gate voltage, while M,
and M; are on. Figure 11.22(a) depicts this condition. Thus, vou = 0.

3. vi =5 V; v2 = 0 V. By symmetry with case 2, we conclude that vou = 0.

4. v; =5 V; v2 = 5 V. Now both M, and M) are open circuits, and therefore vou = 0.

These results are summarized in the table below. The output voltage for case 4 is sufficiently
close to zero to be considered zero for logic purposes.

Thus, the gate is a NOR gate.

Comments: While exact analysis of CMOS gate circuits could be tedious and involved, the
method demonstrated in this example—to determine whether transistors are on or off—leads
to very simple analysis. Since in logic devices one is interested primarily in logic levels and
not in exact values, this approximate analysis method is very appropriate.

Analog Switches

A common form of analog gate employs a FET and takes advantage of the fact that
current can flow in either direction in a FET biased in the ohmic region. Recall that
the drain characteristic of the MOSFET discussed in Section 11.2 consists of three
regions: ohmic, active, and breakdown. AMOSFET amplifier is operated in the active
region, where the drain current is nearly constant for any given value of vgs. On the
other hand, a MOSFET biased in the ohmic state acts very much as a linear resistor. For
example, for an n-channel enhancement MOSFET, the conditions for the transistor
to be in the ohmic region are

1
ves > Vr and lups| < 4 (vas —Vr) (11.13)

As long as the FET is biased within these conditions, it acts simply as a linear resistor,
and it can conduct current in either direction (provided that vps does not exceed the
limits stated in equation 11.13). In particular, the resistance of the channel in the
ohmic region is found to be

The most important feature of the MOSFET operating in the ohmic region, then, is that
it acts as a voltage-controlled resistor, with the gate-source voltage vgs controlling
the channel resistance Rps. The use of the MOSFET as a switch in the ohmic region,
then, consists of providing a gate-source voltage that can either hold the MOSFET
in the cutoff region (vgs < V7) or bring it into the ohmic region. In this fashion, vgs
acts as a control voltage for the transistor.

Consider the circuit shown in Figure 11.24, where we presume that vc can
be varied externally and that v;, is some analog signal source that we may wish to
connect to the load R; at some appropriate time. The operation of the switch is as
follows. When vc < Vr, the FET is in the cutoff region and acts as an open circuit.

Part II Electronics

When vc > Vr (with a value of vgs such that the MOSFET is in the ohmic region),
the transistor acts as a linear resistance Rps. If Rps « Rez, then vou © vin. By using
a pair of MOSFETs, it is possible to improve the dynamic range of signals one can
transmit through this analog gate.

MOSFET analog switches are usually produced in integrated-circuit (IC) form
and denoted by the symbol shown in Figure 11.25.

Conclusion

This chapter has introduced field-effect transistors, focusing primarily on metal-oxide semicon-
ductor enhancement-mode n-channel devices to explain the operation of FETs as amplifiers.
A brief introduction to p-channel devices is used as the basis to introduce CMOS technology,
and to present analog and digital switches and logic gate applications of MOSFETs. Upon
completing this chapter, you should have mastered the following learning objectives:

1. Understand the classification of field-effect transistors. FETs include three major
families; the enhancement-mode family is the most commonly used and is the one
explored in this chapter. Depletion-mode and junction FETs are only mentioned briefly.

2. Learn the basic operation of enhancement-mode MOSFETs by understanding their i-v
curves and defining equations. MOSFETs can be described by the i—v drain
characteristic curves, and by a set of nonlinear equations linking the drain current to the
gate-to-source and drain-to-source voltages. MOSFETs can operate in one of four
regions: cutoff, in which the transistor does not conduct current; triode, in which the
transistor can act as a voltage-controlled resistor under certain conditions; saturation, in
which the transistor acts as a voltage-controlled current source and can be used as an
amplifier; and breakdown when the limits of operation are exceeded.

3. Learn how enhancement-mode MOSFET circuits are biased. MOSFET circuits can be
biased to operate around a certain operating point, known as the Q point, by
appropriately selecting supply voltages and resistors.

4. Understand the concept and operation of FET large-signal amplifiers. Once a MOSFET
circuit is properly biased in the saturation region, it can serve as an amplifier by virtue of
its voltage-controlled current source property: small changes in the gate-to-source
voltages are translated to proportional changes in drain current.

5. Understand the concept and operation of FET switches. MOSFETs can serve as analog
and digital switches: by controlling the gate voltage, a MOSFET can be turned on and off
(digital switch), or its resistance can be modulated (analog switch).

6. Analyze FET switches and digital gates. These devices find application in CMOS circuits
as digital logic gates and analog transmission gates.

DIGITAL LOGIC CIRCUITS

igital computers have taken a prominent place in engineering and science over

the last three decades, performing a number of essential functions such as

numerical computations and data acquisition. It is not necessary to further

stress the importance of these electronic systems in this book, since you are
already familiar with personal computers and programming languages. The objective
of the chapter is to discuss the essential features of digital logic circuits, which are at
the heart of digital computers, by presenting an introduction to combinational logic
circuits.

The chapter starts with a discussion of the binary number system and contin-
ues with an introduction to boolean algebra. The self-contained treatment of boolean
algebra will enable you to design simple logic functions using the techniques of com-
binational logic, and several practical examples are provided to demonstrate that even
simple combinations of logic gates can serve to implement useful circuits in engineer-
ing practice. In a later section, we introduce a number of logic modules which can be
described by using simple logic gates but which provide more advanced functions.
Among these, we discuss read-only memories, multiplexers, and decoders. Finally,

we describe the operation of sequential logic modules, including flip-flops, counters,
and registers. Throughout the chapter, simple examples are given to demonstrate the
usefulness of digital logic circuits in various engineering applications.

This chapter provides the background needed to address the study of digital
systems. Upon completion of the chapter, you should be able to:

12.1 ANALOG AND DIGITAL SIGNALS

One of the fundamental distinctions in the study of electronic circuits (and in the
analysis of any signals derived from physical measurements) is that between analog
and digital signals. An analog signal is an electric signal whose value varies in analogy
with a physical quantity (e.g., temperature, force, or acceleration). For example, a
voltage proportional to a measured variable pressure or to a vibration naturally varies
in an analog fashion. Figure 12.1 depicts an analog function of time f(t). We note
immediately that for each value of time f¢, f (t) can take one value among any of the
values in a given range. For example, in the case of the output voltage of an op-amp,
we expect the signal to take any value between +V,,, and —V,, where V,,, is the
supply-imposed saturation voltage.

A digital signal, on the other hand, can take only a finite number of values.
This is an extremely important distinction, as will be shown shortly. An example of
a digital signal is a signal that allows display of a temperature measurement on a
digital readout. Let us hypothesize that the digital readout is three digits long and
can display numbers from 0 to 100, and let us assume that the temperature sensor is
correctly calibrated to measure temperatures from 0 to 100°C. Further, the output of
the sensor ranges from 0 to 5 V, where 0 V corresponds to 0°C and 5 V to 100°C.
Therefore, the calibration constant of the sensor is

100°C — 0°C 5

kr = 5Va0V = 20°C/V
Clearly, the output of the sensor is an analog signal; however, the display can show
only a finite number of readouts (101, to be precise). Because the display itself can
only take a value out of a discrete set of states—the integers from 0 to 100—we call
it a digital display, indicating that the variable displayed is expressed in digital form.

Now, each temperature on the display corresponds to a range of voltages: each
digit on the display represents one-hundredth of the 5-V range of the sensor, or 0.05
V=50 mV. Thus, the display will read 0 if the sensor voltage is between 0 and 49 mV,
1 if it is between 50 and 99 mV, and so on. Figure 12.2 depicts the staircase function
relationship between the analog voltage and the digital readout. This quantization
of the sensor output voltage is in effect an approximation. If one wished to know
the temperature with greater precision, a greater number of display digits could be
employed.

arithmetic (which we discuss in Section 12.2), the two discrete values f; and fo are
represented, respectively, by the numbers | and 0. In binary voltage waveforms, these
values are represented by two voltage levels. For example, in the TTL convention
(see Chapter 10), these values are (nominally) 5 and 0 V, respectively; in CMOS cir-
cuits, these values can vary substantially. Other conventions are also used, including
reversing the assignment, for example, by letting a 0-V level represent a logic 1 and
a 5-V level represent a logic 0. Note that in a binary waveform, knowledge of the
transition between one state and another (e.g., from fp to f; at tf = t)) is equivalent to
knowledge of the state. Thus, digital logic circuits can operate by detecting transitions
between voltage levels. The transitions are often called edges and can be positive (fo
to f,) or negative (f; to fo). Virtually all the signals handled by a computer are binary.
From here on, whenever we speak of digital signals, you may assume that the text is
referring to signals of the binary type, unless otherwise indicated.

12.2 THE BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM

The binary number system is a natural choice for representing the behavior of circuits
that operate in one of two states (on or off, 1 or 0, or the like). The diode and transistor
gates and switches studied in Chapters 10 and 11 fall in this category. Table 12.1 shows
the correspondence between decimal and binary number systems for base 10 integers
up to 16.

Binary numbers are based on powers of 2, whereas the decimal system is
based on powers of 10. For example, the number 372 in the decimal system can be
expressed as

372 = (3 x 10°) + (7 x 10!) + (2 x 10°)

while the binary number 10110 corresponds to the following combination of powers
of 2:

10110 = (1 x 24) + (0 x 2) + (1 x 27) + (1 x 2!) + 0 x 2°)

It is relatively simple to see the correspondence between the two number systems if
we add the terms on the right-hand side of the previous expression. Let nz represent
the number n base 2 (i.e., in the binary system), and let jo be the same number
base 10. Then our notation will be as follows:

101102 = 16+0+4+4+2+4+0 = 2219

Note that a fractional number can also be similarly represented. For example, the
number 3.25 in the decimal system may be represented as

3.2519 =3 x 10°+2x 1071 +5 x 10°
while in the binary system the number 10.011 corresponds to
10.011, =1 x 2'+0x 2°+0x27141x27+41x2>
=2+04+0+ 454+ § =2.37510

Table 12.1 shows that it takes four binary digits, also called bits, to represent the base
10 integers up to 15. Usually, the rightmost bit is called the least significant bit, or
LSB, and the leftmost bit is called the most significant bit, or MSB. Since binary
numbers clearly require a larger number of digits than base 10 integers do, the digits
are usually grouped in sets of 4, 8, or 16. Four bits are usually termed a nibble, 8 bits
is called a byte, and 16 bits (or 2 bytes) is a word.

Addition and Subtraction

The operations of addition and subtraction are based on the simple rules shown in
Table 12.2. Note that, just as is done in the decimal system, a carry is generated
whenever the sum of two digits exceeds the largest single-digit number in the given
number system, which is | in the binary system. The carry is treated exactly as in the
decimal system. A few examples of binary addition are shown in Figure 12.4, with
their decimal counterparts.

Multiplication and Division

Whereas in the decimal system the multiplication table consists of 107 = 100 entries,
in the binary system we only have 2? = 4 entries. Table 12.4 represents the complete
multiplication table for the binary number system.

Division in the binary system is also based on rules analogous to those of the
decimal system, with the two basic laws given in Table 12.5. Once again, we need be
concerned with only two cases, and just as in the decimal system, division by zero is
not contemplated.

Conversion from Decimal to Binary

The conversion of a decimal number to its binary equivalent is performed by suc-
cessive division of the decimal number by 2, checking for the remainder each time.
Figure 12.6 illustrates this idea with an example. The result obtained in Figure 12.6
may be easily verified by performing the opposite conversion, from binary to decimal:

110001 = 2° + 24 + 2° = 324+ 16+1=49

The same technique can be used for converting decimal fractional numbers to their
binary form, provided that the whole number is separated from the fractional part
and each is converted to binary form (separately), with the results added at the end.
Figure 12.7 outlines this procedure by converting the number 37.53 to binary form.
The procedure is outlined in two steps. First, the integer part is converted; then, to
convert the fractional part, one simple technique consists of multiplying the decimal
fraction by 2 in successive stages. If the result exceeds 1, a | is needed to the right
of the binary fraction being formed (100101..., in our example). Otherwise, a 0
is added. This procedure is continued until no fractional terms are left. In this case,
the decimal part is 0.53;9, and Figure 12.7 illustrates the succession of calculations.
Stopping the procedure outlined in Figure 12.7 after 11 digits results in the following
approximation:

37.5319 = 100101.10000111101

Part II Electronics

Greater precision could be attained by continuing to add binary digits, at the expense
of added complexity. Note that an infinite number of binary digits may be required
to represent a decimal number exactly.

Complements and Negative Numbers

To simplify the operation of subtraction in digital computers, complements are used
almost exclusively. In practice, this corresponds to replacing the operation X — Y with
the operation X + (—Y). This procedure results in considerable simplification, since
the computer hardware need include only adding circuitry. Two types of complements
are used with binary numbers: the ones complement and the twos complement.

The ones complement of an n-bit binary number is obtained by subtracting the
number itself from 2” — 1. Two examples are as follows:

a=0101
Ones complement of a = (24 — 1) —a
= (1111) — (0101)
= 1010
b= 101101
Ones complement of b = (2° — 1) —b
= (111111) — (101101)
= 010010

The twos complement of an n-bit binary number is obtained by subtracting the
number itself from 2”. Twos complements of the same numbers a and b used in the
preceding illustration are computed as follows:

a=0101
Twos complement of a = 2+ — a
= (10000) — (0101)
= 1011
b= 101101
Twos complement of b = 2° — b
= (1000000) — (101101)
= 010011

A simple rule that may be used to obtain the twos complement directly from a binary
number is the following: Starting at the least significant (rightmost) bit, copy each bit
until the first 1 has been copied, and then replace each successive | by a 0 and each
0 by a 1. You may wish to try this rule on the two previous examples to verify that it
is much easier to use than subtraction from 2”.

Different conventions exist in the binary system to represent whether a num-
ber is negative or positive. One convention, called the sign-magnitude convention,
makes use of a sign bit, usually positioned at the beginning of the number, for which
a value of | represents a minus sign and a value of 0 represents a plus sign. Thus,
an 8-bit binary number would consist of 1 sign bit followed by 7 magnitude bits, as
shown in Figure 12.8(a). In a digital system that uses 8-bit signed integer words, we

or

A second convention uses the ones complement notation. In this convention, a
sign bit is also used to indicate whether the number is positive (sign bit = 0) or negative
(sign bit = 1). However, the magnitude of the binary number is represented by the true
magnitude if the number is positive and by its ones complement if the number is neg-
ative. Figure 12.8(b) illustrates the convention. For example, the number 919 would
be represented by the 7-bit binary number 1011011, with a leading 0 (the sign bit):
010110115. On the other hand, the number —91,9 would be represented by the 7-bit
ones complement binary number 0100100) with a leading 1 (the sign bit): 10100100).

Most digital computers use the twos complement convention in performing
integer arithmetic operations. The twos complement convention represents positive
numbers by a sign bit of 0, followed by the true binary magnitude; negative numbers
are represented by a sign bit of 1, followed by the twos complement of the binary
number, as shown in Figure 12.8(c). The advantage of the twos complement conven-
tion is that the algebraic sum of twos complement binary numbers is carried out very
simply by adding the two numbers including the sign bit. Example 12.1 illustrates
twos complement addition.

EXAMPLE 12.1 Twos Complement Operations Co2
Problem
Perform the following subtractions, using twos complement arithmetic.

1. X — Y = 1011100 — 1110010
2. X —Y = 10101111 — 01110011

Solution

Analysis: The twos complement subtractions are performed by replacing the operation X — Y
with the operation X + (—Y). Thus, we first find the twos complement of Y and add the result
to X in each of the two cases:

X — Y = 1011100 — 1110010 = 1011100 + (27 — 1110010)
= 1011100 + 0001110 = 1101010

Next, we add the sign bit (in boldface type) in front of each number (1 in first case since the
difference X — Y is a negative number):

xX —Y =11101010
Repeating for the second subtraction gives

X —Y = 10101111 — 01110011 = 10101111 + (28 — 01110011)
= 10101111 + 10001101 = 00111100
= 000111100

where the first digit is a0 because X — Y is a positive number.

The Hexadecimal System

It should be apparent by now that representing numbers in base-2 and base-10 systems
is purely a matter of convenience, given a specific application. Another base frequently
used is the hexadecimal system, a direct derivation of the binary number system. In
the hexadecimal (or hex) code, the bits in a binary number are subdivided into groups
of 4. Since there are 16 possible combinations for a 4-bit number, the natural digits in
the decimal system (0 through 9) are insufficient to represent a hex digit. To solve this

problem, the first six letters of the alphabet are used, as shown in Table 12.6. Thus,
in hex code, an 8-bit word corresponds to just two digits; for example,

1010 01112 = A7i6
0010 10012 = 2916

Binary Codes

In this subsection, we describe two common binary codes that are often used for prac-
tical reasons. The first is a method of representing decimal numbers in digital logic cir-
cuits that is referred to as binary-coded decimal, or BCD, representation. In effect,
the simplest BCD representation is just a sequence of 4-bit binary numbers that stops
after the first 10 entries, as shown in Table 12.7. There are also other BCD codes, all re-
flecting the same principle: Each decimal digit is represented by a fixed-length binary
word. One should realize that although this method is attractive because of its direct
correspondence with the decimal system, it is not efficient. Consider, for example, the
decimal number 68. Its binary representation by direct conversion is the 7-bit number
1000100. However, the corresponding BCD representation would require 8 bits:

6819 = 01101000gcp

9 1001 111 100

Another code that finds many applications is the Gray code. This is simply a
reshuffling of the binary code with the property that any two consecutive numbers
differ only by 1 bit. Table 12.8 illustrates the 3-bit Gray code. The Gray code can be
very useful in practical applications, because in counting up or down according to
this code, the binary representation of a number changes only | bit at a time.

12.3 BOOLEAN ALGEBRA

The mathematics associated with the binary number system (and with the more general

field of logic) is called boolean, in honor of the English mathematician George Boole,

who published a treatise in 1854 entitled An Investigation of the Laws of Thought,

on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities. The

development of a logical algebra, as Boole called it, is one of the results of his

investigations. The variables in a boolean, or logic, expression can take only one of

two values, usually represented by the numbers 0 and 1. These variables are sometimes ; ~

. . eye logical addition (OR)

referred to as true (1) and false (0). This convention is normally referred to as positive

logic. There is also a negative logic convention in which the roles of logic 1 and logic 0+0=0

0 are reversed. In this book we employ only positive logic. O+1=1 ( LO3

values that each of the boolean variables can take, and of the corresponding value of
the desired function. In the following paragraphs we define the basic logic functions
upon which boolean algebra is founded, and we describe each in terms of a set of
tules and a truth table; in addition, we introduce logic gates. Logic gates are physical
devices (see Chapters 10 and 11) that can be used to implement logic functions.

AND and OR Gates

The basis of boolean algebra lies in the operations of logical addition, or the OR
operation; and logical multiplication, or the AND operation. Both of these find a
correspondence in simple logic gates, as we shall presently illustrate. Logical addition,
although represented by the symbol +, differs from conventional algebraic addition,
as shown in the last rule listed in Table 12.9. Note that this rule also differs from the last
tule of binary addition studied in Section 12.2. Logical addition can be represented
by the logic gate called an OR gate, whose symbol and whose inputs and outputs are
shown in Figure 12.9. The OR gate represents the following logical statement:

If either X or Y is true (1), then Z is true (1). Logical OR (12.1)

This rule is embodied in the electronic gates discussed in Chapters 10 and 11, in which
a logic | corresponds, say, to a 5-V signal and a logic 0 to a 0-V signal.

Logical multiplication is denoted by the center dot - and is defined by the rules of
Table 12.10. Figure 12.10 depicts the AND gate, which corresponds to this operation.
The AND gate corresponds to the following logical statement:

If both X and Y are true (1), then Z is true (1). Logical AND (12.2)

One can easily envision logic gates (AND and OR) with an arbitrary number of inputs;
three- and four-input gates are not uncommon.

The rules that define a logic function are often represented in tabular form
by means of a truth table. Truth tables for the AND and OR gates are shown in
Figures 12.9 and 12.10. A truth table is nothing more than a tabular summary of all
possible outputs of a logic gate, given all possible input values. If the number of
inputs is 3, the number of possible combinations grows from 4 to 8, but the basic idea
is unchanged. Truth tables are very useful in defining logic functions. A typical logic
design problem might specify requirements such as “the output Z shall be logic 1 only
when the condition (X = 1 AND Y = 1) OR (W = 1) occurs, and shall be logic 0
otherwise.” The truth table for this particular logic function is shown in Figure 12.11
as an illustration. The design consists, then, of determining the combination of logic
gates that exactly implements the required logic function. Truth tables can greatly
simplify this procedure.

The AND and OR gates form the basis of all logic design in conjunction with the
NOT gate. The NOT gate is essentially an inverter (which can be constructed by using
bipolar or field-effect transistors, as discussed in Chapters 10 and 11, respectively),
and it provides the complement of the logic variable connected to its input. The
complement of a logic variable X is denoted by X. The NOT gate has only one input,
as shown in Figure 12.12.

To illustrate the use of the NOT gate, or inverter, we return to the design example
of Figure 12.11, where we required that the output of a logic circuit be Z = | only
ifX =OAND Y = 1 ORif W = 1. We recognize that except for the requirement
X = 0, this problem would be identical if we stated it as follows: “The output Z shall
be logic | only when the condition (X = 1AND Y = 1) OR(W = 1) occurs, and

Part II Electronics

shall be logic 0 otherwise.” If we use an inverter to convert X to X, we see that the
required condition becomes (X =1AND Y = 1) OR(W = 1). The formal solution
to this elementary design exercise is illustrated in Figure 12.13.

In the course of the discussion of logic gates, we make frequent use of truth tables
to evaluate logic expressions. A set of basic rules will facilitate this task. Table 12.11
lists some of the rules of boolean algebra; each of these can be proved by using a
truth table, as will be shown in examples and exercises. An example proof for rule 16
is given in Figure 12.14 in the form of a truth table. This technique can be employed
to prove any of the laws of Table 12.11. From the simple truth table in Figure 12.14,
which was obtained step by step, we can clearly see that indeed X -(X + Y) = X. This
methodology for proving the validity of logical equations is called proof by perfect
induction. The 19 rules of Table 12.11 can be used to simplify logic expressions.

To complete the introductory material on boolean algebra, a few paragraphs
need to be devoted to two very important theorems, called De Morgan’s theorems.
These are stated here in the form of logic functions:

(X+Y)=X-Y (12.3)
De Morgan’s Theorems
(X-Y)=X+Y (12.4)

These two laws state a very important property of logic functions:

Any logic function can be implemented by using only OR and NOT gates, or
only AND and NOT gates.

De Morgan’s laws can easily be visualized in terms of logic gates, as shown in
Figure 12.15. The associated truth tables are proofs of these theorems.

The importance of De Morgan’s laws lies in the statement of the duality
that exists between AND and OR operations: Any function can be realized by just
one of the two basic operations, plus the complement operation. This gives rise
to two families of logic functions, sums of products and product of sums, as
shown in Figure 12.16. Any logical expression can be reduced to one of these
two forms. Although the two forms are equivalent, it may well be true that one
of the two has a simpler implementation (fewer gates). Example 12.3 illustrates this

Find: Logical expression realizing the function y.

Analysis: To determine a logical expression for the function y, first we need to convert the
truth table to a logical expression. We do so by expressing y as the sum of the products of
the three variables for each combination that yields y = 1. If the value of a variable is 1, we
use the uncomplemented variable. If it’s 0, we use the complemented variable. For example,
the second row (first instance of y = 1) would yield the term A - B - C. Thus,

-B-C+A-B-C+A-B-C+A-B-C+A-B-C+A-B-C
-C(B+B)+A-B-(C+C)+A-B-(C+C)
-C+A-B+A-B=A-C+A-(B+B)=A-C+A=A+C

A+Cz=y or A y Thus, the function is a two-input OR gate, as shown in Figure 12.17.

Problem

Realize the logic function y = A + B- C in product-of-sums form. Implement the solution,
using AND, OR, and NOT gates.

Solution
Known Quantities: Logical expression for the function y(A, B, C).

Find: Physical realization using AND, OR, and NOT gates.

Chapter 12 Digital Logic Circuits

Analysis: We use the fact that y = y and apply De Morgan’s theorem as follows:
y=A+(B-C)=A-(B-C)=A-(B+C)
y=y=A-(B+O0)

The preceding sum-of-products function is realized using complements of each variable
(obtained using NOT gates) and is finally complemented as shown in Figure 12.18.

Figure 12.18

Comments: It should be evident that the original sum-of-products expression, which could
be implemented with just one AND and one OR gate, has a much more efficient realization. In
the next section we show a systematic approach to function minimization.

NAND and NOR Gates

In addition to the AND and OR gates we have just analyzed, the complementary forms
of these gates, called NAND and NOR, are very commonly used in practice. In fact,
NAND and NOR gates form the basis of most practical logic circuits. Figure 12.19
depicts these two gates and illustrates how they can be easily interpreted in terms
of AND, OR, and NOT gates by virtue of De Morgan’s laws. You can readily ver-
ify that the logic function implemented by the NAND and NOR gates corresponds,
respectively, to AND and OR gates followed by an inverter. It is very important to

note that, by De Morgan’s laws, the NAND gate performs a logical addition on the
complements of the inputs, while the NOR gate performs a logical multiplication
on the complements of the inputs. Functionally, then, any logic function could be
implemented with either NOR or NAND gates only.

The next section shows how to systematically approach the design of logic
functions. First, we provide a few examples to illustrate logic design with NAND and
NOR gates.

EXAMPLE 12.6 Realizing the AND Function with NAND Gates

Problem

Use a truth table to show that the AND function can be realized using only NAND gates, and
show the physical realization.

Solution

Known Quantities: AND and NAND truth tables.
Find: AND realization using NAND gates.
Assumptions: Consider two-input functions and gates.

Analysis: The truth table below summarizes the two functions:

Clearly, to realize the AND function, we need to simply invert the output of a NAND gate.
This is easily accomplished if we observe that a NAND gate with its inputs tied together acts
as an inverter; you can verify this in the above truth table by looking at the NAND output for
the input combinations 0-0 and 1-1, or by referring to Figure 12.20. The final realization is
shown in Figure 12.21.

Comments: NAND gates naturally implement functions that contain complemented products.
Gates that employ negative logic are a natural consequence of the inverting characteristics of
transistor switches (refer to Section 10.5). Thus, one should expect that NAND (and NOR)
gates are very commonly employed in practice.

Chapter 12 Digital Logic Circuits

We review many of these common logic modules in Section 12.5. An example of this
idea is provided by the exclusive OR (XOR) gate, which provides a logic function
similar, but not identical, to the OR gate we have already studied. The XOR gate acts
as an OR gate, except when its inputs are all logic 1s; in this case, the output is a
logic 0 (thus the term exclusive). Figure 12.25 shows the logic circuit symbol adopted
for this gate and the corresponding truth table. The logic function implemented by
the XOR gate is the following: either X or Y, but not both. This description can be
extended to an arbitrary number of inputs.
The symbol adopted for the exclusive OR operation is ®, and so we write

Z=X@Y

to denote this logic operation. The XOR gate can be obtained by a combination of the
basic gates we are already familiar with. For example, if we observe that the XOR
function corresponds to Z = X ®@ Y = (X + Y)- (X - Y), we can realize the XOR
gate by means of the circuit shown in Figure 12.26.

Show that the XOR function can also be expressed as Z = X -Y + Y - X. Realize the
corresponding function, using NOT, AND, and OR gates. (Hint: Use truth tables for the logic

Assumptions: Two-, three-, and four-input gates are available.

Analysis: The addition of two binary digits was illustrated in Section 12.2 (see Table 12.2,
repeated here). It is important to observe that when both A and B are equal to 1, the sum requires
two digits: the lower digit is a 0, and there also is a carry of 1. Thus, the circuit representing
this operation must give an output consisting of two digits. Figure 12.27 shows a circuit called
half adder, that performs binary addition providing two output bits: the sum, S, and the carry,

We can write the rule for addition in the form of a logic statement, as follows: S is 1 ifA
is Oand B is 1, or if A is 1 and B is 0; C is 1 if A and B are 1. In terms of a logic function, we
can express this statement with the following logical expressions:

and an OR gate to process the addition of two bits, A and B, plus the possible carry from a

this operation.

Comments: To perform the addition of two four-bit “words,” we would need a half adder for
the first column (LSB), and a full adder for each additional column, that is, three full adders.

12.4 KARNAUGH MAPS AND LOGIC DESIGN

In examining the design of logic functions by means of logic gates, we have discovered
that more than one solution is usually available for the implementation of a given
logic expression. It should also be clear by now that some combinations of gates can
implement a given function more efficiently than others. How can we be assured of
having chosen the most efficient realization? Fortunately, there is a procedure that
utilizes a map describing all possible combinations of the variables present in the
logic function of interest. This map is called a Karnaugh map, after its inventor.
Figure 12.29 depicts the appearance of Karnaugh maps for two-, three-, and four-
variable expressions in two different forms. As can be seen, the row and column
assignments for two or more variables are arranged so that all adjacent terms change
by only 1 bit. For example, in the two-variable map, the columns next to column 01
are columns 00 and 11. Also note that each map consists of 2” cells, where N is the
number of logic variables.

Each cell in a Karnaugh map contains a minterm, that is, a product of the V
variables that appear in our logic expression (in either uncomplemented or comple-
mented form). For example, for the case of three variables (V = 3), there are 3=8

such combinations, or minterms: X -Y-Z, X -Y-Z,X-Y-Z,X -Y-Z,X-Y-Z,
X-Y-Z,X-Y-Z, and X - Y -Z. The content of each cell—that is, the minterm—is
the product of the variables appearing at the corresponding vertical and horizontal
coordinates. For example, in the three-variable map, X - Y - Z appears at the intersec-
tion of X - Y and Z. The map is filled by placing a value of 1 for any combination of
variables for which the desired output is a 1. For example, consider the function of
three variables for which we desire to have an output of 1 whenever variables X, Y,

and Z have the following values:

xX =0 Y Z=0
xX=0 Y= Z=1
x=1 Y= Z=0
x=1 Y= Z=1

Figure 12.29 Two-, three-, and four-variable Karnaugh maps

The same truth table is shown in Figure 12.30 together with the corresponding
Karnaugh map.

The Karnaugh map provides an immediate view of the values of the function
in graphical form. Further, the arrangement of the cells in the Karnaugh map is such
that any two adjacent cells contain minterms that vary in only one variable. This
property, as will be verified shortly, is quite useful in the design of logic functions by
means of logic gates, especially if we consider the map to be continuously wrapping
around itself, as if the top and bottom, and right and left, edges were touching. For the
three-variable map given in Figure 12.29, for example, the cell X - Y - Z is adjacent
to X - Y -Z if we “roll” the map so that the right edge touches the left. Note that these
two cells differ only in the variable X, a property that we earlier claimed adjacent
cells have.!

Shown in Figure 12.31 is a more complex, four-variable logic function, which
will serve as an example in explaining how Karnaugh maps can be used directly
to implement a logic function. First, we define a subcube as a set of 2” adjacent

'A useful rule to remember is that in a two-variable map, there are two minterms adjacent to any given
minterm; in a three-variable map, three minterms are adjacent to any given minterm; in a four-variable
map, the number is four, and so on.

cells with logical value 1, for m = 1,2,3,...,N. Thus, a subcube can consist
of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,... cells. All possible subcubes for the four-variable map of
Figure 12.29 are shown in Figure 12.32. Note that there are no four-cell subcubes in
this particular case. Note also that there is some overlap between subcubes. Exam-
ples of four-cell and eight-cell subcubes are shown in Figure 12.33 for an arbitrary
expression.

In general, one tries to find the largest possible subcubes to cover all the | entries
in the map. How do maps and subcubes help in the realization of logic functions, then?
The use of maps and subcubes in minimizing logic expressions is best explained by
considering the following rule of boolean algebra:

Y-X+Y-X=Y

where the variable Y could represent a product of logic variables [e.g., we could
similarly write (Z-W)-X +(Z-W)-X =Z-W with Y = Z- W). This rule is easily
proved by factoring Y

Y-(X +X)

and observing that X + X = 1 always. Then it should be clear that variable X need
not appear in the expression at all.

Let us apply this rule to a more complex logic expression, to verify that it can
also apply to this case. Consider the logic expression

W-X-Y-Z4+W-X-Y-Z4+W-X-Y-Z4+W-X-Y-Z

and factor it as follows:

W-Z-Y-(X+X)4+W-Y-Z-(K4+X)=W-Z-Y4+W-Y-Z
=Y-Z-(W4+W)=Y-Z

That is quite a simplification! If we consider, now, a map in which we place a | in
the cells corresponding to the mintermsW-X -Y-Z,W-X-Y-Z,W-X-Y-Z,


Part II Electronics

and W -X -Y - Z, forming the previous expression, we obtain the Karnaugh map of
Figure 12.34. It can easily be verified that the map of Figure 12.34 shows a single
four-cell subcube corresponding to the term Y - Z.

We have not established formal rules yet, but it definitely appears that the map
method for simplifying boolean expressions is a convenient tool. In effect, the map has
performed the algebraic simplification automatically! We can see that in any subcube,
one or more of the variables present will appear in both complemented and uncom-
plemented forms in all their combinations with the other variables. These variables
can be eliminated. As an illustration, in the eight-cell subcube case of Figure 12.35,
the full-blown expression would be

W-X-Y-Z+W-X-Y-Z4+W-X-Y-Z4+W-X-Y-Z

4+W-X-Y-Z4+W-X-Y-Z4+W-X-Y-Z4+W-X-Y-Z

However, if we consider the eight-cell subcube, we note that the three variables
X, W, and Z appear in both complemented and uncomplemented form in all their
combinations with the other variables and thus can be removed from the expression.
This reduces the seemingly unwieldy expression simply to Y! In logic design terms,
a simple inverter is sufficient to implement the expression.

The example just shown is a particularly simple one, but it illustrates how
simple it can be to determine the minimal expression for a logic function. Clearly,
the larger a subcube, the greater the simplification that will result. For subcubes that
do not intersect, as in the previous example, the solution can be found easily and is
unique.

Sum-of-Products Realizations

Although not explicitly stated, the logic functions of the preceding section were all
in sum-of-products form. As you know, it is also possible to realize logic functions in
product-of-sums form. This section discusses the implementation of logic functions
in sum-of-products form and gives a set of design rules. The next section will do the
same for product-of-sums form logical expressions. The following rules are a useful
aid in determining the minimal sum-of-products expression:

Product-of-Sums Realizations

Thus far, we have exclusively worked with sum-of-products expressions, that is,
logic functions of the form A - B + C - D. We know, however, that De Morgan’s laws
state that there is an equivalent form that appears as a product of sums, for example,
(W+Y)-(Y +Z). The two forms are completely equivalent logically, but one of the
two forms may lead to a realization involving a smaller number of gates. When using

these rules.

Don’t Care Conditions

Another simplification technique may be employed whenever the value of the logic
function to be implemented can be either a | or a 0. This condition may result from
the specification of the problem and is not uncommon. Whenever it does not matter
whether a position in the map is filled by a 1 or a 0, we use a don’t care entry,
denoted by an x. Then the don’t care can be used as either a | or a 0, depending
on which results in a greater simplification (i.e., helps in forming the smallest num-
ber of maximal subcubes). The following examples illustrate the use of don’t care
conditions.

12.5 COMBINATIONAL LOGIC MODULES

The basic logic gates described in the previous section are used to implement more
advanced functions and are often combined to form logic modules, which, thanks
to modern technology, are available in compact integrated-circuit packages. In this
section and the next, we discuss a few of the more common combinational logic
modules, illustrating how these can be used to implement advanced logic functions.

Multiplexers

Multiplexers, or data selectors, are combinational logic circuits that permit the
selection of one of many inputs. A typical multiplexer (MUX) has 2” data lines,
n address (or data select) lines, and one output. In addition, other control inputs
(e.g., enables) may exist. Standard, commercially available MUXs allow for n up
to 4; however, two or more MUXs can be combined if a greater range is needed. The
MUX allows for one of 2” inputs to be selected as the data output; the selection of
which input is to appear at the output is made by way of the address lines. Figure 12.52
depicts the block diagram of a four-input MUX. The input data lines are labeled Do,
D,, D2, and D3; the data select, or address, lines are labeled Jp and J,; and the output
is available in both complemented and uncomplemented form and is thus labeled F,
or F. Finally, an enable input, labeled E, is also provided, as a means of enabling
or disabling the MUX: if E = 1, the MUX is disabled; if E = 0, it is enabled. The
negative logic (MUX off when EF = | and on when E = QO) is represented by the
small “bubble” at the enable input, which represents a complement operation (just
as at the output of NAND and NOR gates). The enable input is useful whenever one
is interested in a cascade of MUXs; this would be of interest if we needed to select a
line from a large number, say, 2° = 256. Then two four-input MUXs could be used
to provide the data selection of 1 of 8.

Chapter 12 Digital Logic Circuits

The material described in previous sections is quite adequate to describe the
internal workings of a multiplexer. Figure 12.53 shows the internal construction of a
4-to-1 MUX using exclusively NAND gates (inverters are also used, but the reader
will recall that a NAND gate can act as an inverter if properly connected).

In the design of digital systems (e.g., microprocessors), a single line is often
required to carry two or more different digital signals. However, only one signal at a
time can be placed on the line. A MUX will allow us to select, at different instants, the
signal we wish to place on this single line. This property is shown here for a 4-to-1
MUX. Figure 12.54 depicts the functional diagram of a 4-to-1 MUX, showing four
data lines, Do through D3, and two select lines, Jj and J;.

The data selector function of a MUX is best understood in terms of Table 12.12.
In this truth table, the xs represent don’t care entries. As can be seen from the truth
table, the output selects one of the data lines depending on the values of J; and Jo,
assuming that Jp is the least significant bit. As an example, [)J) = 10 selects Do,
which means that the output F will select the value of the data line D2. Therefore
F=1ifD,=landF =0if D, =0.

Read-Only Memory (ROM)

Another common technique for implementing logic functions uses a read-only
memory, or ROM. As the name implies, a ROM is a logic circuit that holds in-
formation in storage (“memory”) —in the form of binary numbers—that cannot be
altered but can be “read” by a logic circuit. A ROM is an array of memory cells, each
of which can store either a | or a 0. The array consists of 2” x n cells, where n is
the number of bits in each word stored in ROM. To access the information stored in

Part II Electronics

ROM, m address lines are required. When an address is selected, in a fashion similar
to the operation of the MUX, the binary word corresponding to the address selected
appears at the output, which consists of n bits, that is, the same number of bits as the
stored words. In some sense, a ROM can be thought of as a MUX that has an output
consisting of a word instead of a single bit.

Figure 12.55 depicts the conceptual arrangement of a ROM with n = 4 and
m = 2. The ROM table has been filled with arbitrary 4-bit words, just for the purpose
of illustration. In Figure 12.55, if one were to select an enable input of 0 (i.e., on)
and values for the address lines of J = 0 and J; = 1, the output word would be
W, = 0110, so that bp = 0, bj = 1, b2 = 1, b3 = 0. Depending on the content of the
ROM and the number of address and output lines, one could implement an arbitrary
logic function.

Unfortunately, the data stored in read-only memories must be entered during
fabrication and cannot be altered later. A much more convenient type of read-only
memory is the erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), the con-
tent of which can be easily programmed and stored and may be changed if needed.
EPROMSs find use in many practical applications, because of their flexibility in content
and ease of programming.

Decoders and Read and Write Memory

Decoders, which are commonly used for applications such as address decoding or
memory expansion, are combinational logic circuits as well. Our reason for introduc-
ing decoders is to show some of the internal organization of semiconductor memory
devices. An important application of decoders is the organization of amemory system.

Figure 12.56 shows the truth table for a 2-to-4 decoder. The decoder has an
enable input G and select inputs B and A. It also has four outputs, Yo through Y3.
When the enable input is logic 1, all decoder outputs are forced to logic 1 regardless
of the select inputs.

This simple description of decoders permits a brief discussion of the internal
organization of an SRAM (static random-access, or read and write, memory).
SRAM is internally organized to provide memory with high speed (i.e., short access
time), a large bit capacity, and low cost. The memory array in this memory device
has a column length equal to the number of words W and a row length equal to the
number of bits per word NV. To select a word, an n-to-W decoder is needed. Since the
address inputs to the decoder select only one of the decoder’s outputs, the decoder
selects one word in the memory array. Figure 12.57 shows the internal organization
of a typical SRAM.

Thus, to choose the desired word from the memory array, the proper address
inputs are required. As an example, if the number of words in the memory array is 8,
a 3-to-8 decoder is needed.

Gate Arrays and Programmable Logic Devices

Digital logic design is performed today primarily using programmable logic devices
(PLDs). These are arrays of gates having interconnections that can be programmed
to perform a specific logical function. PLDs are large combinational logic modules
consisting of arrays of AND and OR gates that can be programmed using special pro-
gramming languages called Hardware description languages (HDLs). Figure 12.58
shows the block diagram of one type of high-density PLD. We define three types of
PLDs:

PROM (programmable read-only memory) offers high speed and low cost
for relatively small designs.

PLA (programmable logic array) offers flexible features for more complex
designs.

PAL/GAL (programmable array logic/generic array logic) offers good
flexibility and is faster and less expensive than a PLA.

Part II Electronics 561

To illustrate the concept of a logic design using a PLD, we employ a generic
array logic (ispGAL16V8) to realize an output signal from three ANDed input signals.
The functional block diagram of the GAL is shown in Figure 12.59(a). Notice that
the device has eight input lines and eight output lines. The output lines also provide
a clock input for timing purposes. The sample code is shown in Figure 12.59(b). The
code first defines the inputs and outputs; and it states the equation describing the
function to be implemented, O14=111 &112&113, defining which output and inputs
are to be used, and the functional relationship. Note that the symbol & represents the
logical function AND.

Asecond example of the use of a PLD introduces the concept of timing diagrams.

in which multiple injections are to be performed. Three pilot injections and one
primary injection are to be performed. The master control line enables the entire
sequence. The resulting output sequence, shown at the bottom of the plot and labeled

“injector fuel pulse,” is the combination of the three pilot pulses and the primary
pulse. Based on the timing plot of the signals shown in Figure 12.60(a), we use
the following inputs: I11=master control, 112=pilot inject #1, 113=pilot inject #2,
114=pilot inject #3, 114=primary inject, and the output O14=injector fuel pulse. You
should convince yourself that the required function is

I11 AND [112 OR 113 OR 114 OR 114]

This function is realized by the code in Figure 12.60(b). Note that the symbol |
represents the logical function OR.

12.6 SEQUENTIAL LOGIC MODULES

The feature that distinguishes combinational logic devices from the other major
family—sequential logic devices—is that combinational logic circuits provide out-
puts that are based on a combination of present inputs only. On the other hand,
sequential logic circuits depend on present and past input values. Because of this
“memory” property, sequential circuits can store information; this capability opens a
whole new area of application for digital logic circuits.

Latches and Flip-Flops

The basic information storage device in a digital circuit is called a flip-flop. There
are many different varieties of flip-flops; however, all flip-flops share the following
characteristics:

1. A flip-flop is a bistable device; that is, it can remain in one of two stable states
(0 and 1) until appropriate conditions cause it to change state. Thus, a flip-flop
can serve as a memory element.

2. A flip-flop has two outputs, one of which is the complement of the other.

RS Flip-Flop

It is customary to depict flip-flops by their block diagram and a name, such as Q or X,
representing the output variable. Figure 12.61 represents the RS flip-flop, which has
two inputs, denoted by S and R, and two outputs Q and Q. The value at Q is called
the state of the flip-flop. If Q = 1, we refer to the device as being in the | state. Thus,
we need define only one of the two outputs of the flip-flop. The two inputs R and $
are used to change the state of the flip-flop, according to the following rules:

1. When R = S = 0, the flip-flop remains in its present state (whether | or 0).

2. When S = | and R = 0, the flip-flop is set to the 1 state (thus, S, for set).

3. When S = 0 and R = 1, the flip-flop is reset to the 0 state (thus, R, for reset).
A

It is not permitted for both S and R to be equal to 1. (This would correspond to
requiring the flip-flop to set and reset at the same time.)

The rules just described are easily remembered by noting that 1s on the S and R inputs
correspond to the set and reset commands, respectively.

A convenient means of describing the series of transitions that occur as the
signals sent to the flip-flop inputs change is the timing diagram. A timing diagram
is a graph of the inputs and outputs of the RS flip-flop (or any other logic device)
depicting the transitions that occur over time. In effect, one could also represent these
transitions in tabular form; however, the timing diagram provides a convenient visual

representation of the evolution of the state of the flip-flop. Figure 12.62 depicts a table
of transitions for an RS flip-flop Q as well as the corresponding timing diagram.

It is important to note that the RS flip-flop is level-sensitive. This means that
the set and reset operations are completed only after the R and S inputs have reached
the appropriate levels. Thus, in Figure 12.62 we show the transitions in the Q output
as occurring with a small delay relative to the transitions in the R and S inputs.

It is instructive to illustrate how an RS flip-flop can be constructed using simple
logic gates. For example, Figure 12.63 depicts a realization of such a circuit consisting
of four gates: two inverters and two NAND gates (actually, the same result could be
achieved with four NAND gates). Consider the case in which the circuit is in the
initial state Q = 0 (and therefore Q = 1). If the input .S = 1 is applied, the top NOT
gate will see inputs O = 1 and S = 0, so that Q= (S- QO) = (0-1) = I—that is,
the flip-flop is set. Note that when Q is set to 1, fa) becomes 0. This, however, does
not affect the state of the Q output, since replacing Q with 0 in the expression

Q=(S-Q)
does not change the result:
Q=(0-0)=1

Thus, the cross-coupled feedback from outputs Q and Q to the input of the NAND
gates is such that the set condition sustains itself. It is straightforward to show (by
symmetry) that a | input on the R line causes the device to reset (i.e., causes Q = 0)
and that this condition is also self-sustaining.

The circuit shown in the figure also serves as an RS flip-flop and requires only two NOR gates.
Analyze the circuit to prove that it operates as an RS flip-flop. (Hint: Use a truth table with two
variables, S and R.)

An extension of the RS flip-flop includes an additional enable input that is gated
into each of the other two inputs. Figure 12.64 depicts an RS flip-flop consisting of
two NOR gates. In addition, an enable input is connected through two AND gates to
the RS' flip-flop, so that an input to the R or S line will be effective only when the
enable input is 1. Thus, any transitions will be controlled by the enable input, which
acts as a synchronizing signal. The enable signal may consist of a clock, in which
case the flip-flop is said to be clocked and its operation is said to be synchronous.

The same circuit of Figure 12.64 can be used to illustrate two additional features
of flip-flops: the preset and clear functions, denoted by the inputs P and C, respec-
tively. When P and C are 0, they do not affect the operation of the flip-flop. Setting
P = | corresponds to setting § = | and therefore causes the flip-flop to go into the |
state. Thus, the term preset: this function allows the user to preset the flip-flop to 1 at
any time. When C is 1, the flip-flop is reset, or cleared (that is, Q is made equal to 0).
Note that these direct inputs are, in general, asynchronous; therefore, they allow the
user to preset or clear the flip-flop at any time. A set of timing waveforms illustrating
the function of the enable, preset, and clear inputs is also shown in Figure 12.64. Note
how transitions occur only when the enable input goes high (unless the preset or clear
inputs are used to override the RS inputs).

Another extension of the RS flip-flop, called the data latch, or delay element,
is shown in Figure 12.65. In this circuit, the R input is always equal to the inverted S$
input, so that whenever the enable input is high, the flip-flop is set. This device has the

dual advantage of avoiding the potential conflict that might arise if both R and S were
high and reducing the number of input connections by eliminating the reset input. This
circuit is called a data latch or delay because once the enable input goes low, the flip-
flop is latched to the previous value of the input. Thus, this device can serve as a basic
memory element, delaying the output by one clock count with respect to the input.

D Flip-Flop

The D flip-flop is an extension of the data latch that utilizes two RS flip-flops, as
shown in Figure 12.66. In this circuit, a clock is connected to the enable input of each
flip-flop. Since Q; sees an inverted clock signal, the latch is enabled when the clock
waveform goes low. However, since Q> is disabled when the clock is low, the output
of the D flip-flop will not switch to the 1 state until the clock goes high, enabling the
second latch and transferring the state of Q; to Q>. It is important to note that the D
flip-flop changes state only on the positive edge of the clock waveform: Q, is set on
the negative edge of the clock, and Q» (and therefore Q) is set on the positive edge
of the clock, as shown in the timing diagram of Figure 12.66. This type of device is
said to be edge-triggered. This feature is indicated by the “knife-edge” drawn next
to the CLK input in the device symbol. The particular device described here is said to
be positive edge—triggered, or leading edge-triggered, since the final output of the
flip-flop is set on a positive-going clock transition.

Chapter 12 Digital Logic Circuits

* When J = 1 and K = 0, the flip-flop is set to 1.

* When both J and K are high, the flip-flop will toggle between states at every
negative transition of the clock input, denoted from here on by the symbol |.

Note that, functionally, the operation of the JK flip-flop can also be explained
in terms of two RS flip-flops. When the clock waveform goes high, the master flip-
flop is enabled; the slave receives the state of the master upon a negative clock
transition. The bubble at the clock input signifies that the device is negative or trailing
edge-triggered. This behavior is similar to that of an RS flip-flop, except for the
J = 1, K = 1 condition, which corresponds to a toggle mode rather than to a
disallowed combination of inputs.

Figure 12.68 depicts the truth table for the JK flip-flop. It is important to note
that when both inputs are 0, the flip-flop remains in its previous state at the occurrence
of a clock transition; when either input is high and the other is low, the JK flip-flop
behaves as the RS flip-flop, whereas if both inputs are high, the output “toggles”
between states every time the clock waveform undergoes a negative transition.

CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Derive the detailed truth table and draw a timing diagram for the JK flip-flop, using the model
of Figure 12.67 with two flip-flops.

EXAMPLE 12.22 The T Flip-Flop

Problem

Determine the truth table and timing diagram of the T flip-flop of Figure 12.69. Note that the
T flip-flop is a JK flip-flop with its inputs tied together.

Solution
Known Quantities: JK flip-flop rules of operation (Figure 12.68).
Find: Truth table and timing diagram for T flip-flop.

Analysis: We recognize that the T flip-flop is a JK flip-flop with its inputs tied together. Thus,
the flip-flop will need only a two-element truth table to describe its operation, corresponding

Comments: The T flip-flop takes its name from the fact that it toggles between the high and
low states. Note that the toggling frequency is one-half that of the clock. Thus the T flip-flop
also acts as a divide-by-2 counter. Counters are explored in greater detail in the next section.

Chapter 12 Digital Logic Circuits

Digital Counters

One of the more immediate applications of flip-flops is in the design of counters.
A counter is a sequential logic device that can take one of N possible states, stepping
through these states in a sequential fashion. When the counter has reached its last
State, it resets to 0 and is ready to start counting again. For example, a 3-bit binary
up counter would have 2? = 8 possible states, and might appear as shown in the
functional block of Figure 12.70. The input clock waveform causes the counter to
step through the eight states, making one transition for each clock pulse. We shall
shortly see that a string of JK flip-flops can accomplish this task exactly. The device
shown in Figure 12.70 also displays a reset input, which forces the counter output to
equal 0: bob; bo = 000.

Although binary counters are very useful in many applications, one is often
interested in a decade counter, that is, a counter that counts from 0 to 9 and then
resets. A 4-bit binary counter can easily be configured in principle to provide this
function by means of simple logic that resets the counter when it has reached the
count 10012 = 9;9. As shown in Figure 12.71, if we connect bits b3 and b, to a four-
input AND gate, along with b2 and bo, the output of the AND gate can be used to reset
the counter after a count of 10. Additional logic can provide a carry bit whenever a
reset condition is reached, which could be passed along to another decade counter,
enabling counts up to 99. Decade counters can be cascaded so as to represent decimal
digits in succession.

Although the decade counter of Figure 12.71 is attractive because of its sim-
plicity, this configuration would never be used in practice, because of the presence
of propagation delays. These delays are caused by the finite response time of the
individual transistors in each logic device and cannot be guaranteed to be identical
for each gate and flip-flop. Thus, if the reset signal—which is presumed to be applied
at exactly the same time to each of the four JK flip-flops in the 4-bit binary counter—
does not cause the JK flip-flops to reset at exactly the same time on account of different
propagation delays, then the binary word appearing at the output of the counter will
change from 1001 to some other number, and the output of the four-input NAND gate
will no longer be high. In such a condition, the flip-flops that have not already reset will
then not be able to reset, and the counting sequence will be irreparably compromised.

What can be done to obviate this problem? The answer is to use a system-
atic approach to the design of sequential circuits, making use of state transition
diagrams.

A simple implementation of the binary counter we have described in terms of its
functional behavior is shown in Figure 12.72. The figure depicts a 3-bit binary ripple
counter, which is obtained from a cascade of three JK flip-flops. The transition table
shown in the figure illustrates how the Q output of each stage becomes the clock
input to the next stage, while each flip-flop is held in the toggle mode. The output
transitions assume that the clock (CLK) is a simple square wave (all J/Ks are negative
edge-triggered).

This 3-bit ripple counter can easily be configured as a divide-by-8 mechanism,
simply by adding an AND gate. To divide the input clock rate by 8, one output pulse
should be generated for every eight clock pulses. If one were to output a pulse every
time a binary 111 combination occurred, a simple AND gate would suffice to generate
the required condition. This solution is shown in Figure 12.73. Note that the square
wave is also included as an input to the AND gate; this ensures that the output is only
as wide as the input signal. This application of ripple counters is further illustrated in
Example 12.24

Problem

A binary ripple counter provides a means of dividing the fixed output rate of a clock by powers
of 2. For example, the circuit of Figure 12.74 is a divide-by-2 or divide-by-4 counter. Draw
the timing diagrams for the clock input, Qo, and Q; to demonstrate these functions.

Assumptions: Assume positive edge—triggered devices. The DC supply voltage is Vcc.

Analysis: Following the timing diagram of Figure 12.75, we see that Qo switches at one-half
the frequency of the clock input, and that Q; switches at one-half the frequency of Qo, hence
the timing diagram shown.

A slightly more complex version of the binary counter is the synchronous
counter, in which the input clock drives all the flip-flops simultaneously. Figure 12.76
depicts a 3-bit synchronous counter. In this figure, we have chosen to represent each
flip-flop as a T flip-flop. The clocks to all the flip-flops are incremented simultaneously.
The reader should verify that Qo toggles to 1 first, and then Q; toggles to 1, and that
the AND gate ensures that Q> will toggle only after Qy) and Q; have both reached the
1 state (Qo - Q; = 1).

the counter counts up or down.

Problem

Draw the timing diagram for the ring counter of Figure 12.77.

Clock
input

Figure 12.77 Ring counter

Solution
Known Quantities: JK flip-flop truth table (Figure 12.68).
Find: Output of each flip-flop Q as a function of the input clock transitions.

Assumptions: Prior to application of the clock input, the Init line sees a positive transition
[this initializes the counter by setting the state of the first flip-flop to 1 through a PR (preset)
input, and all other states to zero through a CLR (clear) input].

Analysis: With the initial state of Q; = 0, a clock transition will set Q3; = 1. The clock also
causes the other three flip-flops to see a reset input of 1, since Q; = Q) = Q; = Qp = Oat the
time of the first clock pulse. Thus, Q2, Q;, and Qo remain in the 0 state. At the second clock
pulse, since Q; is now 1, the second flip-flop will see a set input of 1, and its output will become
Q> = 1. Both Q; and Qo remain in the 0 state, and Q; is reset to 0. The pattern continues,
causing the | state to ripple from left to right and back again. This rightward rotation gives the
counter its name. The transition table is shown below.

Comments: The shifting function implemented by the ring counter is used in the shift registers
discussed in the following section.


Part II Electronics

Registers

A register consists of a cascade of flip-flops that can store binary data, | bit in each
flip-flop. The simplest type of register is the parallel input—parallel output register
shown in Figure 12.78. In this register, the Joad input pulse, which acts on all clocks
simultaneously, causes the parallel inputs bob; b2b3 to be transferred to the respective
flip-flops. The D flip-flop employed in this register allows the transfer from b, to
Q,, to occur very directly. Thus, D flip-flops are very commonly used in this type of
application. The binary word b3b 2b, bo is now “stored,” each bit being represented by
the state of a flip-flop. Until the load input is applied again and a new word appears
at the parallel inputs, the register will preserve the stored word.

“Load”

The construction of the parallel register presumes that the N-bit word to be
stored is available in parallel form. However, often a binary word will arrive in serial
form, that is, 1 bit at a time. A register that can accommodate this type of logic signal
is called a shift register. Figure 12.79 illustrates how the same basic structure of the
parallel register applies to the shift register, except that the input is now applied to
the first flip-flop and shifted along at each clock pulse. Note that this type of register
provides both a serial and a parallel output.

applications. Upon completing this chapter, you should have mastered the following learning

objectives:

Understand the concepts of analog and digital signals and of quantization.

Convert between decimal and binary number systems and use the hexadecimal system
and BCD and Gray codes. The binary and hexadecimal systems form the basis of
numerical computing.

Write truth tables, and realize logic functions from truth tables using logic gates.
Boolean algebra permits the analysis of digital circuits through a relatively simple set of
tules. Digital logic gates are the means through which one can implement logic
functions; truth tables permit the easy visualization of logic functions and can aid in the
realization of these functions by using logic gates.

Systematically design logic functions using Karnaugh maps. The design of logic circuits
can be systematically approached by using an extension of truth tables called the
Karnaugh map. Karnaugh maps facilitate the simplification of logic expressions and their

realization through logic gates in either sum-of-products or product-of-sums form.

5. Study various combinational logic modules, including multiplexers, memory and
decoder elements, and programmable logic arrays. Practical digital logic circuits rarely
consist of individual logic gates; gates are usually integrated into combinational logic
modules that include memory elements and gate arrays.

6. Analyze the operation of sequential logic circuits. Sequential logic circuits are digital
logic circuits with memory capabilities; their operation is described by state transition

tables and state diagrams.

7. Understand the operation of digital counters. Counters are a very important class of

sequential logic circuits.

manager has a difficult time keeping track of all the
rules of thumb that guide decisions. To assist your
favorite baseball team, you have been asked to design
a logic circuit that will flash a light when the manager
should give the steal sign. The rules have been laid out
for you by a baseball fan with limited knowledge of
the game as follows: Give the steal sign if there is a
runner on first base and

a. There are no other runners, the pitcher is
right-handed, and the runner is fast or

b. There is one other runner on third base, and one of
the runners is fast or

c. There is one other runner on second base, the
pitcher is left-handed, and both runners are fast.

Under no circumstances should the steal sign be given
if all three bases have runners. Design a logic circuit
that implements these rules to indicate when the steal
sign should be given.

height of water or the flow rate is too high, the sensors
produce a logic high output. Design a logic circuit that
sounds an alarm whenever the height of water in both
tanks is too high and either of the flow rates is too
high, or whenever both flow rates are too high and the
height of water in either tank is also too high.

12.23 Many automobiles incorporate logic circuits to

alert the driver to problems or potential problems. In

one particular car, a buzzer is sounded whenever the

ignition key is turned and either a door is open or a seat
belt is not fastened. The buzzer also sounds when the

key is not turned but the lights are on. In addition,
the car will not start unless the key is in the ignition,
the car is in park, and all doors are closed and seat

belts fastened. Design a logic circuit that takes all the

inputs listed and sounds the buzzer and starts the car
when appropriate.

12.24 An on/off start-up signal governs the compressor
motor of a large commercial air conditioning unit. In
general, the start-up signal should be on whenever the
output of a temperature sensor S exceeds a reference

compressor start-ups to certain hours of the day and

also enable service technicians to start up or shut down

the compressor through a manual override. A
time-of-day indicator D is available with on/off

outputs, as is a manual override switch M . A separate
timer T prohibits a compressor start-up within 10 min

of a previous shutdown. Design a logic diagram that

incorporates the state of all four devices (S, D, M, and

T) and produces the correct on/off condition for the
motor start-up.

Persons with type B blood can donate to both B and

12.62 One method of ensuring reliability in data

transmission systems is to transmit a parity bit along
with every nibble, byte, or word of binary data
transmitted. The parity bit confirms whether an even or
odd number of 1s were transmitted in the data. In
even-parity systems, the parity bit is set to 1 when the
number of 1s in the transmitted data is odd. Odd-parity
systems set the parity bit to 1 when the number of 1s in
the transmitted data is even. Assume that a parity bit is
transmitted for every nibble of data. Design a logic
circuit that checks the nibble of data and transmits the
proper parity bit for both even- and odd-parity systems.

12.63 Assume that a parity bit is transmitted for every

nibble of data. Design two logic circuits that check a
nibble of data and its parity bit to determine if there

may have been a data transmission error. Assume first
an even-parity system, then an odd-parity system.

input from an optical encoder and translates it into two
4-bit nibbles of BCD.

input from an optical encoder and determines if the
input value is a multiple of 3.

12.66 The 4221 code is a base 10-oriented code that
assigns the weights 4221 to each of 4 bits in a nibble of
data. Design a logic circuit that takes a BCD nibble as
input and converts it to its 4221 equivalent. The logic
circuit should also report an error in the BCD input if
its value exceeds 1001.

12.67 The 4-bit digital output of each of two sensors
along an assembly line conveyor belt is proportional to
the number of parts that pass by on the conveyor belt
in a 30-s period. Design a logic circuit that reports an
error if the outputs of the two sensors differ by more
than one part per 30-s period.

he objective of this chapter is to introduce the fundamental notions of

electromechanical energy conversion, leading to an understanding of the

operation of various electromechanical transducers. The chapter also

serves as an introduction to the material on electric machines to be presented
in Chapter 14. The foundations for the material introduced in this chapter will be
found in the circuit analysis chapters (1 through 7).

The subject of electromechanical energy conversion is one that should be of
particular interest to the non-electrical engineer, because it forms one of the important
points of contact between electrical engineering and other engineering disciplines.
Electromechanical transducers are commonly used in the design of industrial and
aerospace control systems and in biomedical applications, and they form the basis
of many common appliances. In the course of our exploration of electromechanics,
we shall illustrate the operation of practical devices, such as loudspeakers, relays,
solenoids, sensors for the measurement of position and velocity, and other devices of
practical interest.

13.1 ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM

The notion that the phenomena of electricity and magnetism are interconnected was
first proposed in the early 1800s by H. C. Oersted, a Danish physicist. Oersted showed
that an electric current produces magnetic effects (more specifically, a magnetic field).
Soon after, the French scientist André Marie Ampére expressed this relationship by
means of a precise formulation known as Ampére’s law. A few years later, the English
scientist Faraday illustrated how the converse of Ampére’s law also holds true, that is,
that a magnetic field can generate an electric field; in short, Faraday’s law states that
a changing magnetic field gives rise to a voltage. We shall undertake a more careful
examination of both Ampére’s and Faraday’s laws in the course of this chapter.

As will be explained in the next few sections, the magnetic field forms a neces-
sary connection between electrical and mechanical energy. Ampére’s and Faraday’s
laws will formally illustrate the relationship between electric and magnetic fields, but
it should already be evident from your own individual experience that the magnetic
field can also convert magnetic energy to mechanical energy (e.g., by lifting a piece of
iron with a magnet). In effect, the devices we commonly refer to as electromechan-
ical should more properly be referred to as electromagnetomechanical, since they
almost invariably operate through a conversion from electrical to mechanical energy
(or vice versa) by means of a magnetic field. Chapters 13 and 14 are concerned with
the use of electricity and magnetic materials for the purpose of converting electrical
to mechanical energy, and back.

The Magnetic Field and Faraday’s Law

The quantities used to quantify the strength of a magnetic field are the magnetic flux
@, in units of webers (Wb); and the magnetic flux density B, in units of webers per
square meter (Wb/m7), or teslas (T). The latter quantity and the associated magnetic
field intensity H (in units of amperes per meter, or A/m) are vectors.! Thus, the
density of the magnetic flux and its intensity are in general described in vector form,
in terms of the components present in each spatial direction (e.g., on the x, y, and

'We will use the boldface symbols B and H to denote the vector forms of B and H; the standard typeface
will represent the scalar flux density or field intensity in a given direction.

Part III Electromechanics

z axes). In discussing magnetic flux density and field intensity in this chapter and
Chapter 14, we shall almost always assume that the field is a scalar field, that is, that
it lies in a single spatial direction. This will simplify many explanations.

It is customary to represent the magnetic field by means of the familiar lines of
force (a concept also due to Faraday); we visualize the strength of a magnetic field
by observing the density of these lines in space. You probably know from a previous
course in physics that such lines are closed in a magnetic field, that is, that they form
continuous loops exiting at a magnetic north pole (by definition) and entering at a
magnetic south pole. The relative strengths of the magnetic fields generated by two
magnets could be depicted as shown in Figure 13.1.

Magnetic fields are generated by electric charge in motion, and their effect is
measured by the force they exert on a moving charge. As you may recall from previous
physics courses, the vector force f exerted on a charge of g moving at velocity u in
the presence of a magnetic field with flux density B is given by

f=quxB (13.1)

where the symbol x denotes the (vector) cross product. If the charge is moving at
a velocity u in a direction that makes an angle 6 with the magnetic field, then the
magnitude of the force is given by

f = quBsiné (13.2)

and the direction of this force is at right angles with the plane formed by the vectors
B and u. This relationship is depicted in Figure 13.2.

The magnetic flux ¢ is then defined as the integral of the flux density over
some surface area. For the simplified (but often useful) case of magnetic flux lines
perpendicular to a cross-sectional area A, we can see that the flux is given by the
integral

o= | Bas
A

in webers, where the subscript A indicates that the integral is evaluated over surface A.
Furthermore, if the flux were to be uniform over the cross-sectional area A (a sim-
plification that will be useful), the preceding integral could be approximated by the
following expression:

(13.3)

p=B-A (13.4)

Figure 13.3 illustrates this idea, by showing hypothetical magnetic flux lines traversing
a surface, delimited in the figure by a thin conducting wire.

Faraday’s law states that if the imaginary surface A were bounded by a
conductor—for example, the thin wire of Figure 13.3—then a changing magnetic
field would induce a voltage, and therefore a current, in the conductor. More precisely,
Faraday’s law states that a time-varying flux causes an induced electromotive force,
or emf, e as follows:

dp
dt
A little discussion is necessary at this point to explain the meaning of the minus

sign in equation 13.5. Consider the one-turn coil of Figure 13.4, which forms a circular

cross-sectional area, in the presence of a magnetic field with flux density B oriented in
a direction perpendicular to the plane of the coil. If the magnetic field, and therefore
the flux within the coil, is constant, no voltage will exist across terminals a and b;
if, however, the flux were increasing and terminals a and b were connected—for
example, by means of a resistor, as indicated in Figure 13.4(b)—current would flow
in the coil in such a way that the magnetic flux generated by the current would oppose
the increasing flux. Thus, the flux induced by such a current would be in the direction
opposite to that of the original flux density vector B. This principle is known as Lenz’s
law. The reaction flux would then point downward in Figure 13.4(a), or into the page
in Figure 13.4(b). Now, by virtue of the right-hand rule, this reaction flux would
induce a current flowing clockwise in Figure 13.4(b), that is, a current that flows out

opposing the increase in flux due to B_ Of terminal b and into terminal a. The resulting voltage across the hypothetical resistor

LO1 )

R would then be negative. If, on the other hand, the original flux were decreasing,
current would be induced in the coil so as to reestablish the initial flux; but this
would mean that the current would have to generate a flux in the upward direction
in Figure 13.4(a) [or out of the page in Figure 13.4(b)]. Thus, the resulting voltage
would change sign.

The polarity of the induced voltage can usually be determined from physical
considerations; therefore the minus sign in equation 13.5 is usually left out. We will
use this convention throughout the chapter.

In practical applications, the size of the voltages induced by the changing
magnetic field can be significantly increased if the conducting wire is coiled many
times around, so as to multiply the area crossed by the magnetic flux lines many
times over. For an N-turn coil with cross-sectional area A, for example, we have the
emf

30 mWb in 2 s. Find the induced voltage in the coil.

AST = 2 OMSUYy


Part III Electromechanics

Figure 13.5 shows an N-turn coil linking a certain amount of magnetic flux; you can
see that if N is very large and the coil is tightly wound (as is usually the case in the
construction of practical devices), it is not unreasonable to presume that each turn of
the coil links the same flux. It is convenient, in practice, to define the flux linkage
X as

1=No (13.7)

so that

(13.8)

Note that equation 13.8, relating the derivative of the flux linkage to the induced
emf, is analogous to the equation describing current as the derivative of charge:

._ aq

at
In other words, flux linkage can be viewed as the dual of charge in a circuit analysis
sense, provided that we are aware of the simplifying assumptions just stated in the
preceding paragraphs, namely, a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the area
delimited by a tightly wound coil. These assumptions are not at all unreasonable
when applied to the inductor coils commonly employed in electric circuits.

What, then, are the physical mechanisms that can cause magnetic flux to change,
and therefore to induce an electromotive force? Two such mechanisms are possible.
The first consists of physically moving a permanent magnet in the vicinity of a coil, for
example, so as to create a time-varying flux. The second requires that we first produce
a magnetic field by means of an electric current (how this can be accomplished is
discussed later in this section) and then vary the current, thus varying the associated
magnetic field. The latter method is more practical in many circumstances, since it
does not require the use of permanent magnets and allows variation of field strength
by varying the applied current; however, the former method is conceptually simpler
to visualize. The voltages induced by a moving magnetic field are called motion
voltages; those generated by a time-varying magnetic field are termed transformer
voltages. We shall be interested in both in this chapter, for different applications.

In the analysis of linear circuits in Chapter 4, we implicitly assumed that the
relationship between flux linkage and current was a linear one

A= Li (13.10)

(13.9)

so that the effect of a time-varying current was to induce a transformer voltage across
an inductor coil, according to the expression

v=L “ (13.11)

dt

This is, in fact, the defining equation for the ideal self-inductance L. In addition to
self-inductance, however, it is important to consider the magnetic coupling that can
occur between neighboring circuits. Self-inductance measures the voltage induced in
a circuit by the magnetic field generated by a current flowing in the same circuit. It is
also possible that a second circuit in the vicinity of the first may experience an induced
voltage as a consequence of the magnetic field generated in the first circuit. As we
shall see in Section 13.4, this principle underlies the operation of all transformers.

Self- and Mutual Inductance

Figure 13.6 depicts a pair of coils, one of which, L), is excited by a current i, and
therefore develops a magnetic field and a resulting induced voltage v;. The second
coil, Lz, is not energized by a current, but links some of the flux generated by current
i; around L; because of its close proximity to the first coil. The magnetic coupling
between the coils established by virtue of their proximity is described by a quantity
called mutual inductance and defined by the symbol M. The mutual inductance is
defined by the equation
diy

v2 =M Tt (13.12)
The dots shown in the two drawings indicate the polarity of the coupling between the
coils. If the dots are at the same end of the coils, the voltage induced in coil 2 by a cur-
rent in coil 1 has the same polarity as the voltage induced by the same current in
coil 1; otherwise, the voltages are in opposition, as shown in the lower part of
Figure 13.6. Thus, the presence of such dots indicates that magnetic coupling is
present between two coils. It should also be pointed out that if a current (and there-
fore a magnetic field) were present in the second coil, an additional voltage would be
induced across coil 1. The voltage induced across a coil is, in general, equal to the
sum of the voltages induced by self-inductance and mutual inductance.

In practical electromagnetic circuits, the self-inductance of a circuit is not
necessarily constant; in particular, the inductance parameter L is not constant, in
general, but depends on the strength of the magnetic field intensity, so that it will
not be possible to use such a simple relationship as v = Ldi/dt, with L constant. If
we revisit the definition of the transformer voltage

do

we see that in an inductor coil, the inductance is given by

L= Ne = (13.14)

i i
This expression implies that the relationship between current and flux in a magnetic
structure is linear (the inductance being the slope of the line). In fact, the properties
of ferromagnetic materials are such that the flux—current relationship is nonlinear,
as we shall see in Section 13.3, so that the simple linear inductance parameter used
in electric circuit analysis is not adequate to represent the behavior of the magnetic
circuits of this chapter. In any practical situation, the relationship between the flux
linkage A and the current is nonlinear, and might be described by a curve similar to
that shown in Figure 13.7. Whenever the i-A curve is not a straight line, it is more
convenient to analyze the magnetic system in terms of energy calculations, since the
corresponding circuit equation would be nonlinear.

In a magnetic system, the energy stored in the magnetic field is equal to the
integral of the instantaneous power, which is the product of voltage and current, just
as in a conventional electric circuit:

Wn = / ei dt’ (13.15)

However, in this case, the voltage corresponds to the induced emf, according to
Faraday’s law,
did d

and is therefore related to the rate of change of the magnetic flux. The energy stored in
the magnetic field could therefore be expressed in terms of the current by the integral

Xr
Win = [cia = fF iar = fia (13.17)

It should be straightforward to recognize that this energy is equal to the area above the
A-i curve of Figure 13.7. From the same figure, it is also possible to define a fictitious
(but sometimes useful) quantity called co-energy, equal to the area under the curve
and identified by the symbol W/,. From the figure, it is also possible to see that the
co-energy can be expressed in terms of the stored energy by means of the following
relationship:

Wi =i. — Wn (13.18)

Example 13.1 illustrates the calculation of energy, co-energy, and induced voltage,
using the concepts developed in these paragraphs.

The calculation of the energy stored in the magnetic field around a magnetic
structure will be particularly useful later in the chapter, when the discussion turns to
practical electromechanical transducers and it will be necessary to actually compute
the forces generated in magnetic structures.

through the coil.

Solution

Known Quantities: }-i relationship; nominal value of 4; coil resistance; coil current.
Find: W,,; W,,; La; v.

Schematics, Diagrams, Circuits, and Given Data: i = (A + 0.547) A; Ap = 0.5 V-s;
R=1Q;i(t) = 0.625 + 0.01 sin(400f).

Assumptions: Assume that the magnetic equation can be linearized, and use the linear model
in all circuit calculations.

Analysis:

1. Calculation of energy and co-energy. From equation 13.17, we calculate the energy as
follows.

Wn= | iQ’)d = +>

The above expression is valid in general; in our case, the inductor is operating at a nominal
flux linkage Ao = 0.5 V-s, and we can therefore evaluate the energy to be

Thus, after equation 13.18, the co-energy is given by
Wi =ik- Wn

where
i=A+0.5A7 = 0.625 A

and

W/ = id — W,, = (0.625)(0.5) — (0.1458) = 0.1667 J

2. Calculation of incremental inductance. If we know the nominal value of flux linkage
(i.e., the operating point), we can calculate a linear inductance La, valid around values of
A close to the operating point Ao. This incremental inductance is defined by the expression

L. = di \~!

and can be computed to be

A=Ag

i.-(4 . =(1+A)'|_, = ! = 0.667 H

A=Ag

The above expressions can be used to analyze the circuit behavior of the inductor when
the flux linkage is around 0.5 V-s, or, equivalently, when the current through the inductor
is around 0.625 A.

3. Circuit analysis using linearized model of inductor. We can use the incremental linear
inductance calculated above to compute the voltage across the inductor in the presence of
a current i(t) = 0.625 + 0.01 sin(400r). Using the basic circuit definition of an inductor
with series resistance R, the voltage across the inductor is given by

di
v=iR+L, 5 = [0.625 + 0.01 sin(400r)] x 1 + 0.667 x 4cos(400r)

= 0.625 + 0.01 sin(400r) + 2.668 cos(400r)
= 0.625 + 2.668 sin(400r + 89.8°) Vv

Comments: The linear approximation in this case is not a bad one: the small sinusoidal current
is oscillating around a much larger average current. In this type of situation, it is reasonable to
assume that the inductor behaves linearly. This example explains why the linear inductor model
introduced in Chapter 4 is an acceptable approximation in most circuit analysis problems.

Ampere’s Law

As explained in the previous section, Faraday’s law is one of two fundamental laws
relating electricity to magnetism. The second relationship, which forms a counterpart
to Faraday’s law, is Ampére’s law. Qualitatively, Ampére’s law states that the mag-
netic field intensity H in the vicinity of a conductor is related to the current carried by
the conductor; thus Ampére’s law establishes a dual relationship with Faraday’s law.

In the previous section, we described the magnetic field in terms of its flux
density B and flux ¢. To explain Ampére’s law and the behavior of magnetic materials,
we need to define a relationship between the magnetic field intensity H and the flux
density B. These quantities are related by

B= pH=p,-u40oH Whim’ orT (13.19)

where the parameter jz is a scalar constant for a particular physical medium (at least,
for the applications we consider here) and is called the permeability of the medium.
The permeability of a material can be factored as the product of the permeability of
free space jg = 47 x 107’ H/m, and the relative permeability jz, which varies greatly
according to the medium. For example, for air and for most electrical conductors and
insulators, j1, is equal to 1. For ferromagnetic materials, j, can take values in the
hundreds or thousands. The size of jz, represents a measure of the magnetic properties
of the material. A consequence of Ampére’s law is that the larger the value of jw, the
smaller the current required to produce a large flux density in an electromagnetic
structure. Consequently, many electromechanical devices make use of ferromagnetic
materials, called iron cores, to enhance their magnetic properties. Table 13.1 gives
approximate values of jz, for some common materials.

Conversely, the reason for introducing the magnetic field intensity is that it
is independent of the properties of the materials employed in the construction of
magnetic circuits. Thus, a given magnetic field intensity H will give rise to different
flux densities in different materials. It will therefore be useful to define sources of
magnetic energy in terms of the magnetic field intensity, so that different magnetic
structures and materials can then be evaluated or compared for a given source. In
analogy with electromotive force, this “source” will be termed the magnetomotive
force (mmf). As stated earlier, both the magnetic flux density and the field intensity
are vector quantities; however, for ease of analysis, scalar fields will be chosen by
appropriately selecting the orientation of the fields, wherever possible.

Ampére’s law states that the integral of the vector magnetic field intensity H
around a closed path is equal to the total current linked by the closed path i:

fu-di= i

where d] is an increment in the direction of the closed path. If the path is in the same
direction as the direction of the magnetic field, we can use scalar quantities to state

that
fua=di

Figure 13.8 illustrates the case of a wire carrying a current i and of a circular
path of radius r surrounding the wire. In this simple case, you can see that the magnetic
field intensity H is determined by the familiar right-hand rule. This rule states that if
the direction of current i points in the direction of the thumb of one’s right hand, the
resulting magnetic field encircles the conductor in the direction in which the other four

fingers would encircle it. Thus, in the case of Figure 13.8, the closed-path integral
becomes equal to H - 27, since the path and the magnetic field are in the same
direction, and therefore the magnitude of the magnetic field intensity is given by

Vu =] voMsuy

Now, the magnetic field intensity is unaffected by the material surrounding the
conductor, but the flux density depends on the material properties, since B = wH.
Thus, the density of flux lines around the conductor would be far greater in the
presence of a magnetic material than if the conductor were surrounded by air. The
field generated by a single conducting wire is not very strong; however, if we arrange
the wire into a tightly wound coil with many turns, we can greatly increase the
strength of the magnetic field. For such a coil, with N turns, one can verify visually
that the lines of force associated with the magnetic field link all the turns of the
conducting coil, so that we have effectively increased the current linked by the flux
lines N-fold. The product N - i is a useful quantity in electromagnetic circuits and is
called the magnetomotive force,” F (often abbreviated mmf), in analogy with the
electromotive force defined earlier:

F=Ni A-turns Magnetomotive force (13.23)

Note that although they are dimensionally equal to amperes, the units of magnetomotive force are
ampere-turns.

Part III Electromechanics

Figure 13.9 illustrates the magnetic flux lines in the vicinity of a coil. The
magnetic field generated by the coil can be made to generate a much greater flux
density if the coil encloses a magnetic material. The most common ferromagnetic
materials are steel and iron; in addition to these, many alloys and oxides of iron—as
well as nickel—and some artificial ceramic materials called ferrites exhibit magnetic
properties. Winding a coil around a ferromagnetic material accomplishes two useful
tasks at once: It forces the magnetic flux to be concentrated within the coil and—if the
shape of the magnetic material is appropriate—completely confines the flux within the
magnetic material, thus forcing the closed path for the flux lines to be almost entirely
enclosed within the ferromagnetic material. Typical arrangements are the iron-core
inductor and the toroid of Figure 13.10. The flux densities for these inductors are
given by

Qn r 2

In equation 13.24, / represents the length of the coil wire; Figure 13.10 defines the
parameter rz in equation 13.25.

Intuitively, the presence of a high-permeability material near a source of
magnetic flux causes the flux to preferentially concentrate in the high-jz material,
rather than in air, much as a conducting path concentrates the current produced by
an electric field in an electric circuit. In the course of this chapter, we shall continue
to develop this analogy between electric circuits and magnetic circuits. Figure 13.11
depicts an example of a simple electromagnetic structure which, as we shall see
shortly, forms the basis of the practical transformer.

13.2. MAGNETIC CIRCUITS

It is possible to analyze the operation of electromagnetic devices such as the one
depicted in Figure 13.11 by means of magnetic equivalent circuits, similar in many
respects to the equivalent electric circuits of earlier chapters. Before we can present
this technique, however, we need to make a few simplifying approximations. The
first of these approximations assumes that there exists a mean path for the magnetic
flux, and that the corresponding mean flux density is approximately constant over the
cross-sectional area of the magnetic structure. Using equation 13.4, we see that a coil
wound around a core with cross-sectional area A will have flux density
?

pu? 13.2
A (13.26)

where A is assumed to be perpendicular to the direction of the flux lines. Figure 13.11
illustrates such a mean path and the cross-sectional area A. Knowing the flux density,
we obtain the field intensity:
B
Hub *%

am Ap
But then, knowing the field intensity, we can relate the mmf of the coil F to the
product of the magnetic field intensity H and the length of the magnetic (mean)
path /; we can use equations 13.24 and 13.19 to derive

F=N-i=H-1 (13.28)

(13.27)

In summary, the mmf is equal to the magnetic flux times the length of the magnetic
path, divided by the permeability of the material times the cross-sectional area:

I
Fe Onn (13.29)

A review of this formula reveals that the magnetomotive force F may be viewed as
being analogous to the voltage source in a series electric circuit, and that the flux @
is then equivalent to the electric current in a series circuit and the term //wA to the
magnetic resistance of one leg of the magnetic circuit. You will note that the term
1/A is very similar to the term describing the resistance of a cylindrical conductor
of length / and cross-sectional area A, where the permeability jz is analogous to the
conductivity 0. The term //jA occurs frequently enough to be assigned the name
of reluctance and the symbol 72. It is also important to recognize the relationship

between the reluctance of a magnetic structure and its inductance. This can be derived
easily starting from equation 13.14:

H (13.30)

In summary, when an N-turn coil carrying a current 7 is wound around a mag-
netic core such as the one indicated in Figure 13.11, the mmf F generated by the coil
produces a flux @ that is mostly concentrated within the core and is assumed to be
uniform across the cross section. Within this simplified picture, then, the analysis of
a magnetic circuit is analogous to that of resistive electric circuits. This analogy is
illustrated in Table 13.3 and in the examples in this section.

The usefulness of the magnetic circuit analogy can be emphasized by analyzing
a magnetic core similar to that of Figure 13.11, but with a slightly modified geometry.
Figure 13.12 depicts the magnetic structure and its equivalent-circuit analogy. In the
figure, we see that the mmf F = Ni excites the magnetic circuit, which is composed
of four legs: two of mean path length /; and cross-sectional area A; = d)w, and the
other two of mean length /) and cross-sectional area Az = d2w. Thus, the reluctance
encountered by the flux in its path around the magnetic core is given by the quantity
Reeriess With

and

Ri = oe Ro = a
MA, MA

It is important at this stage to review the assumptions and simplifications made
in analyzing the magnetic structure of Figure 13.12:

1. All the magnetic flux is linked by all the turns of the coil.
2. The flux is confined exclusively within the magnetic core.

3. The density of the flux is uniform across the cross-sectional area
of the core.

You can probably see intuitively that the first of these assumptions might not
hold true near the ends of the coil, but that it might be more reasonable if the coil
is tightly wound. The second assumption is equivalent to stating that the relative
permeability of the core is infinitely higher than that of air (presuming that this is
the medium surrounding the core); if this were the case, the flux would indeed be
confined within the core. It is worthwhile to note that we make a similar assumption
when we treat wires in electric circuits as perfect conductors: The conductivity of
copper is substantially greater than that of free space, by a factor of approximately
10!°. In the case of magnetic materials, however, even for the best alloys, we have
a relative permeability only on the order of 10° to 10*. Thus, an approximation that
is quite appropriate for electric circuits is not nearly as good in the case of magnetic
circuits. Some of the flux in a structure such as those of Figures 13.11 and 13.12
would thus not be confined within the core (this is usually referred to as leakage
flux). Finally, the assumption that the flux is uniform across the core cannot hold for
a finite-permeability medium, but it is very helpful in giving an approximate mean
behavior of the magnetic circuit.

The magnetic circuit analogy is therefore far from being exact. However,
short of employing the tools of electromagnetic field theory and of vector calculus,
or advanced numerical simulation software, it is the most convenient tool at
the engineer’s disposal for the analysis of magnetic structures. In the remainder
of this chapter, the approximate analysis based on the electric circuit analogy
will be used to obtain approximate solutions to problems involving a variety of
useful magnetic circuits, many of which you are already familiar with. Among
these will be the loudspeaker, solenoids, automotive fuel injectors, sensors for the
measurement of linear and angular velocity and position, and other interesting
applications.

Comments: This example has illustrated all the basic calculations that pertain to mag-

chapter) simplify the problem and make its approximate numerical solution possible in a few
simple steps. In reality, flux leakage, fringing, and uneven distribution of flux across the struc-
ture would require the solution of three-dimensional equations using finite-element methods.
These methods are not discussed in this book, but are necessary for practical engineering
designs.

The usefulness of these approximate methods is that you can, for example, quickly calcu-
late the approximate magnitude of the current required to generate a given magnetic flux or flux
density. You shall soon see how these calculations can be used to determine electromagnetic
energy and magnetic forces in practical structures.

Consider the analysis of the same simple magnetic structure when an air gap
is present. Air gaps are very common in magnetic structures; in rotating machines,
for example, air gaps are necessary to allow for free rotation of the inner core of the
machine. The magnetic circuit of Figure 13.17(a) differs from the circuit analyzed
in Example 13.2 simply because of the presence of an air gap; the effect of the gap
is to break the continuity of the high-permeability path for the flux, adding a high-
reluctance component to the equivalent circuit. The situation is analogous to adding
a very large series resistance to a series electric circuit. It should be evident from (a)
Figure 13.17(a) that the basic concept of reluctance still applies, although now two
different permeabilities must be taken into account.

The equivalent circuit for the structure of Figure 13.17(a) may be drawn as
shown in Figure 13.17(b), where R,, is the reluctance of path /,, form = 1,2,...,5, R3
and ®, is the reluctance of the air gap. The reluctances can be expressed as follows, Ri >

as they cross an air gap. The flux lines actually bow out of the gap defined by the magnetic circuit with an air gap
cross section A, not being contained by the high-permeability material any longer.

Thus, it is customary to define an area A, that is greater than A, to account for this

phenomenon. Example 13.3 describes in greater detail the procedure for finding A,

and also discusses the phenomenon of fringing.

Analysis:

1. Calculation of magnetomotive force. From equation 13.28, we calculate the magnetomo-
tive force:

F = mmf = Ni = (100 turns)(1 A) = 100 A-turns
2. Calculation of mean path. Figure 13.19 depicts the geometry. The path length is

However, the path must be broken into three legs: the upside-down U-shaped element,
the air gaps, and the bar. We cannot treat these three parts as one because the relative
permeability of the magnetic material is very different from that of the air gap. Thus, we
define the following three paths, neglecting the very small (half bar thickness) lengths Js
and [¢:

lu=ht+h+h ha =l+lkt+h ly leap = le + Le
where

ly =0.18m — Iyg =0.09m Iggy = 0.005 m

Next, we compute the cross-sectional area. For the magnetic structure, we calculate the
square cross section to be A = w? = (0.01)? = 0.0001 m7. For the air gap, we will make
an empirical adjustment to account for the phenomenon of fringing, that is, to account for
the tendency of the magnetic flux lines to bow out of the magnetic path, as illustrated in
Figure 13.20. A rule of thumb used to account for fringing is to add the length of the gap
to the actual cross-sectional area. Thus

Agap = (0.01 m + Ip)” = (0.0125)" = 0.15625 x 107° m?

3. Calculation of reluctance. Knowing the magnetic path length and cross-sectional area,
we can calculate the reluctance of each leg of the circuit:

Note that the reluctance of the air gap is dominant with respect to that of the magnetic
structure, in spite of the small dimension of the gap. This is so because the relative
permeability of the air gap is much smaller than that of the magnetic material.

The equivalent reluctance of the structure is

Req = Ru + Roar + Reap = 1.43 x 105 +0.715 x 105 + 2.55 x 107

= 4 10’ A-turns/Wb
Thus,

Since the gap reluctance is two orders of magnitude greater than the reluctance of the
magnetic structure, it is reasonable to neglect the magnetic structure reluctance and work
only with the gap reluctance in calculating the magnetic flux.

13.3. MAGNETIC MATERIALS AND B-H CURVES

In the analysis of magnetic circuits presented in the previous sections, the relative per-
meability jz, was treated as a constant. In fact, the relationship between the magnetic
flux density B and the associated field intensity H

B= yH (13.32)

is characterized by the fact that the relative permeability of magnetic materials is
not a constant, but is a function of the magnetic field intensity. In effect, all magnetic
materials exhibit a phenomenon called saturation, whereby the flux density increases
in proportion to the field intensity until it cannot do so any longer. Figure 13.25
illustrates the general behavior of all magnetic materials. You will note that since the
B-H curve shown in the figure is nonlinear, the value of jz (which is the slope of the
curve) depends on the intensity of the magnetic field.

To understand the reasons for the saturation of a magnetic material, we need
to briefly review the mechanism of magnetization. The basic idea behind magnetic
materials is that the spin of electrons constitutes motion of charge, and therefore leads
to magnetic effects, as explained in the introductory section of this chapter. In most
materials, the electron spins cancel out, on the whole, and no net effect remains. In
ferromagnetic materials, on the other hand, atoms can align so that the electron spins
cause a net magnetic effect. In such materials, there exist small regions with strong

Chapter 13 Principles of Electromechanics

magnetic properties, called magnetic domains, the effects of which are neutralized
in unmagnetized material by other, similar regions that are oriented differently, in
a random pattern. When the material is magnetized, the magnetic domains tend to
align with one another, to a degree that is determined by the intensity of the applied
magnetic field.

In effect, the large number of miniature magnets within the material is polarized
by the external magnetic field. As the field increases, more and more domains become
aligned. When all the domains have become aligned, any further increase in magnetic
field intensity does not yield an increase in flux density beyond the increase that would
be caused in a nonmagnetic material. Thus, the relative permeability , approaches
1 in the saturation region. It should be apparent that an exact value of jw, cannot
be determined; the value of jz, used in the earlier examples is to be interpreted
as an average permeability, for intermediate values of flux density. As a point of
reference, commercial magnetic steels saturate at flux densities around a few teslas.
Figure 13.28, shown later in this section, will provide some actual B-H curves for
common ferromagnetic materials.

The phenomenon of saturation carries some interesting implications with regard
to the operation of magnetic circuits: The results of the previous section would seem
to imply that an increase in the mmf (i.e., an increase in the current driving the coil)
would lead to a proportional increase in the magnetic flux. This is true in the linear
region of Figure 13.25; however, as the material reaches saturation, further increases
in the driving current (or, equivalently, in the mmf ) do not yield further increases in
the magnetic flux.

There are two more features that cause magnetic materials to further deviate
from the ideal model of the linear B-H relationship: eddy currents and hysteresis.
The first phenomenon consists of currents that are caused by any time-varying flux
in the core material. As you know, a time-varying flux will induce a voltage, and
therefore a current. When this happens inside the magnetic core, the induced voltage
will cause eddy currents (the terminology should be self-explanatory) in the core,
which depend on the resistivity of the core. Figure 13.26 illustrates the phenomenon
of eddy currents. The effect of these currents is to dissipate energy in the form of
heat. Eddy currents are reduced by selecting high-resistivity core materials, or by
laminating the core, introducing tiny, discontinuous air gaps between core layers (see
Figure 13.26). Lamination of the core reduces eddy currents greatly without affecting
the magnetic properties of the core.

It is beyond the scope of this chapter to quantify the losses caused by induced
eddy currents, but it will be important in Chapter 14 to be aware of this source of
energy loss.

Hysteresis is another loss mechanism in magnetic materials; it displays a rather
complex behavior, related to the magnetization properties of a material. The curve of
Figure 13.27 reveals that the B-H curve for a magnetic material during magnetization
(as H is increased) is displaced with respect to the curve that is measured when the
material is demagnetized. To understand the hysteresis process, consider a core that
has been energized for some time, with a field intensity of H; A-turns/m. As the current
required to sustain the mmf corresponding to H, is decreased, we follow the hysteresis
curve from the point a to the point 6. When the mmf is exactly zero, the material
displays the remanent (or residual) magnetization B,.. To bring the flux density to
zero, we must further decrease the mmf (1.e., produce a negative current) until the
field intensity reaches the value —H (point y on the curve). As the mmf is made more
negative, the curve eventually reaches the point a’. If the excitation current to the coil

Part III Electromechanics

is now increased, the magnetization curve will follow the path a’ = B’ = y’ =a,
eventually returning to the original point in the B-H plane, but via a different path.

The result of this process, by which an excess magnetomotive force is required
to magnetize or demagnetize the material, is a net energy loss. It is difficult to evaluate
this loss exactly; however, it can be shown that it is related to the area between the
curves of Figure 13.27. There are experimental techniques that enable the approximate
measurement of these losses.

Figure 13.28(a) through (c) depicts magnetization curves for three very common
ferromagnetic materials: cast iron, cast steel, and sheet steel. These curves will be
useful in solving some of the homework problems.

13.4 TRANSFORMERS

One of the more common magnetic structures in everyday applications is the
transformer. The ideal transformer was introduced in Chapter 7 as a device that
can step an AC voltage up or down by a fixed ratio, with a corresponding decrease
or increase in current. The structure of a simple magnetic transformer is shown in
Figure 13.29, which illustrates that a transformer is very similar to the magnetic
circuits described earlier in this chapter. Coil L; represents the input side of the trans-
former, while coil L, is the output coil; both coils are wound around the same magnetic

structure, which we show here to be similar to the “square doughnut” of the earlier
examples.

Figure 13.29 Structure of a transformer

The ideal transformer operates on the basis of the same set of assumptions we
made in earlier sections: The flux is confined to the core, the flux links all turns of both
coils, and the permeability of the core is infinite. The last assumption is equivalent
to stating that an arbitrarily small mmf is sufficient to establish a flux in the core.
In addition, we assume that the ideal transformer coils offer negligible resistance to
current flow.

The operation of a transformer requires a time-varying current; if a time-varying
voltage is applied to the primary side of the transformer, a corresponding current will
flow in L;; this current acts as an mmf and causes a (time-varying) flux in the structure.
But the existence of a changing flux will induce an emf across the secondary coil!
Without the need for a direct electrical connection, the transformer can couple a source
voltage at the primary to the load; the coupling occurs by means of the magnetic field
acting on both coils. Thus, a transformer operates by converting electric energy to
magnetic, and then back to electric. The following derivation illustrates this viewpoint
in the ideal case (no loss of energy) and compares the result with the definition of the
ideal transformer in Chapter 7.

If a time-varying voltage source is connected to the input side, then by virtue
of Faraday’s law, a corresponding time-varying flux d¢/dt is established in coil L;:

dp

el =N, dt =v) (13.33)
But since the flux thus produced also links coil Zz, an emf is induced across the output
coil as well:

d

dt
This induced emf can be measured as the voltage v2 at the output terminals, and
one can readily see that the ratio of the open-circuit output voltage to input-terminal

voltage is

mM _y (13.35)

vy 6M

If a load current i2 is now required by the connection of a load to the output
circuit (by closing the switch in the figure), the corresponding mmf is Fy = Ni.
This mmf, generated by the load current i, would cause the flux in the core to change;
however, this is not possible, since a change in @ would cause a corresponding change
in the voltage induced across the input coil. But this voltage is determined (fixed) by
the source v; (and is therefore d¢/dt), so that the input coil is forced to generate a

Part III Electromechanics

counter-mmf to oppose the mmf of the output coil; this is accomplished as the input
coil draws a current i, from the source v; such that

IN, = inN> (13.36)
or

> ON 1

2 tiga (13.37)

al N> N

where «@ is the ratio of primary to secondary turns (the transformer ratio) and N; and
N> are the primary and secondary turns, respectively. If there were any net difference
between the input and output mmf, the flux balance required by the input voltage
source would not be satisfied. Thus, the two magnetomotive forces must be equal.
As you can easily verify, these results are the same as in Chapter 7; in particular, the
ideal transformer does not dissipate any power, since

Note the distinction we have made between the induced voltages (emf’s) e and the
terminal voltages v. In general, these are not the same.

The results obtained for the ideal case do not completely represent the physical
nature of transformers. A number of loss mechanisms need to be included in a practical
transformer model, to account for the effects of leakage flux, for various magnetic
core losses (e.g., hysteresis), and for the unavoidable resistance of the wires that form
the coils.

Commercial transformer ratings are usually given on the nameplate, which
indicates the normal operating conditions. The nameplate includes the following
parameters:

+ Primary-to-secondary voltage ratio
* Design frequency of operation
* (Apparent) rated output power

For example, a typical nameplate might read 480:240 V, 60 Hz, 2 kVA. The voltage
ratio can be used to determine the turns ratio, while the rated output power represents
the continuous power level that can be sustained without overheating. It is important
that this power be rated as the apparent power in kilovoltamperes, rather than real
power in kilowatts, since a load with low power factor would still draw current and
therefore operate near rated power. Another important performance characteristic of
a transformer is its power efficiency, defined by

Power efficiency n = Output power (13.39)

Input power

Examples 13.7 and 13.8 illustrate the use of the nameplate ratings and the calculation
of efficiency in a practical transformer, in addition to demonstrating the application
of the circuit models.

13.5 ELECTROMECHANICAL ENERGY
CONVERSION

From the material developed thus far, it should be apparent that electromagneto-
mechanical devices are capable of converting mechanical forces and displacements
to electromagnetic energy, and that the converse is also possible. The objective of
this section is to formalize the basic principles of energy conversion in electromagne-
tomechanical systems, and to illustrate its usefulness and potential for application by
presenting several examples of energy transducers. A transducer is a device that can
convert electrical to mechanical energy (in this case, it is often called an actuator),
or vice versa (in which case it is called a sensor).

Several physical mechanisms permit conversion of electrical to mechanical
energy and back, the principal phenomena being the piezoelectric effect, consisting

616

Chapter 13 Principles of Electromechanics

of the generation of a change in electric field in the presence of strain in certain
crystals (e.g., quartz), and electrostriction and magnetostriction, in which changes
in the dimension of certain materials lead to a change in their electrical (or magnetic)
properties. Although these effects lead to many interesting applications, this chapter is
concerned only with transducers in which electric energy is converted to mechanical
energy through the coupling of a magnetic field. It is important to note that all
rotating machines (motors and generators) fit the basic definition of electromechanical
transducers we have just given.

Forces in Magnetic Structures

Mechanical forces can be converted to electric signals, and vice versa, by means of
the coupling provided by energy stored in the magnetic field. In this subsection, we
discuss the computation of mechanical forces and of the corresponding electromag-
netic quantities of interest; these calculations are of great practical importance in
the design and application of electromechanical actuators. For example, a problem
of interest is the computation of the current required to generate a given force in
an electromechanical structure. This is the kind of application that is likely to be
encountered by the engineer in the selection of an electromechanical device for a
given task.

As already seen in this chapter, an electromechanical system includes an
electrical system and a mechanical system, in addition to means through which the
two can interact. The principal focus of this chapter has been the coupling that
occurs through an electromagnetic field common to both the electrical system and
the mechanical system; to understand electromechanical energy conversion, it will
be important to understand the various energy storage and loss mechanisms in the
electromagnetic field. Figure 13.32 illustrates the coupling between the electrical
and mechanical systems. In the mechanical system, energy loss can occur because
of the heat developed as a consequence of friction, while in the electrical system,
analogous losses are incurred because of resistance. Loss mechanisms are also
present in the magnetic coupling medium, since eddy current losses and hysteresis
losses are unavoidable in ferromagnetic materials. Either system can supply energy,
and either system can store energy. Thus, the figure depicts the flow of energy
from the electrical to the mechanical system, accounting for these various losses.
The same flow could be reversed if mechanical energy were converted to elec-
trical form.

Moving-Iron Transducers

One important class of electromagnetomechanical transducers is that of moving-iron
transducers. The aim of this section is to derive an expression for the magnetic forces
generated by such transducers and to illustrate the application of these calculations
to simple, yet common devices such as electromagnets, solenoids, and relays. The
simplest example of a moving-iron transducer is the electromagnet of Figure 13.33,
in which the U-shaped element is fixed and the bar is movable. In the following
paragraphs, we shall derive a relationship between the current applied to the coil, the
displacement of the movable bar, and the magnetic force acting in the air gap.

The principle that will be applied throughout the section is that in order for
a mass to be displaced, some work needs to be done; this work corresponds to a
change in the energy stored in the electromagnetic field, which causes the mass to be
displaced. With reference to Figure 13.33, let f, represent the magnetic force acting
on the bar and x the displacement of the bar, in the direction shown. Then the net work
into the electromagnetic field W,,, is equal to the sum of the work done by the electric
circuit plus the work done by the mechanical system. Therefore, for an incremental
amount of work, we can write

dW,, = ei dt —f, dx (13.40)

where e is the electromotive force across the coil and the minus sign is due to the
sign convention indicated in Figure 13.33. Recalling that the emf e is equal to the
derivative of the flux linkage (equation 13.16), we can further expand equation 13.40
to obtain

di
dWy = eidt —fedx =i 7 dt ~ fedu = idh —fedx (13.41)

or
fe dx =idd — dWn (13.42)

Now we must observe that the flux in the magnetic structure of Figure 13.33 depends
on two variables, which are in effect independent: the current flowing through the coil
and the displacement of the bar. Each of these variables can cause the magnetic flux
to change. Similarly, the energy stored in the electromagnetic field is also dependent
on both current and displacement. Thus we can rewrite equation 13.42 as follows:

Or or OWin OWin
fedx =i | — di+ — dx) — | —di+ —a (13.43)

Since i and x are independent variables, we can write

where the term W,, was defined as the co-energy in equation 13.18. Finally, we
observe that the force acting to pull the bar toward the electromagnet structure, which
we will call f, is of opposite sign relative to f., and assuming that W,, = W,,,

Equation 13.46 includes a very important assumption: that the energy is equal to the
co-energy. If you refer to Figure 13.7, you will realize that in general this is not true.
Energy and co-energy are equal only if the A-i relationship is linear. Thus, the useful
result of equation 13.46, stating that the magnetic force acting on the moving iron is
proportional to the rate of change of stored energy with displacement, applies only
for linear magnetic structures.

Thus, to determine the forces present in a magnetic structure, it will be necessary
to compute the energy stored in the magnetic field. To simplify the analysis, it will
be assumed hereafter that the structures analyzed are magnetically linear. This is, of
course, only an approximation, in that it neglects a number of practical aspects of
electromechanical systems (e.g., the nonlinear A-i curves described earlier, and the
core losses typical of magnetic materials), but it permits relatively simple analysis
of many useful magnetic structures. Thus, although the analysis method presented in
this section is only approximate, it will serve the purpose of providing a feeling for the
direction and the magnitude of the forces and currents present in electromechanical
devices. On the basis of a linear approximation, it can be shown that the stored energy
in a magnetic structure is given by

Wn = oF (13.47)

One of the more common practical applications of the concepts FIND IT l
discussed in this section is the solenoid. Solenoids find application
in a variety of electrically controlled valves. The action of a solenoid
valve is such that when it is energized, the plunger moves in such a |[WXHRTSI
direction as to permit the flow of a fluid through a conduit, as shown schematically
in Figure 13.34. Ulf

Examples 13.10 and 13.11 illustrate the calculations involved in the determi- rath coll enereized

Assumptions: Assume that the reluctance of the iron is negligible; neglect fringing. At x = 0
the plunger is in the gap by an infinitesimal displacement e.

Analysis:

1. Force on the plunger. To compute a general expression for the magnetic force exerted on
the plunger, we need to derive an expression for the force in the air gap. Using equation
13.50, we see that we need to compute the reluctance of the structure and the magnetic
flux to derive an expression for the force.

Since we are neglecting the iron reluctance, we can write the expression for the
reluctance as follows. Note that the area of the gap is variable, depending on the position
of the plunger, as shown in Figure 13.36.

Thus, the force in the gap is proportional to the square of the current and does not vary
with plunger displacement.

2. Calculation of magnetomotive force. To determine the required magnetomotive force, we
observe that the magnetic force must overcome the mechanical (restoring) force generated
by the spring. Thus, fa) = kx = ka. For the stated values, fa, = (10 N/m) x (0.01 m) =
0.1 N, and

The required mmf can be most effectively realized by keeping the current value relatively
low and using a large number of turns.

Comments: The same mmf can be realized with an infinite number of combinations of current
and number of turns; however, there are tradeoffs involved. If the current is very large (and
the number of turns small), the required wire diameter will be very large. Conversely, a small
current will require a small wire diameter and a large number of turns. A homework problem
explores this tradeoff.

Assumptions: The inductance of the solenoid is approximately constant and is equal to the

Analysis: From Example 13.10, we have an expression for the reluctance of the solenoid:

Comments: The assumption that the inductance is approximately constant is not quite accu-
rate. The reluctance (and therefore the inductance) of the structure will change as the plunger
moves into position. However, allowing for the inductance to be a function of plunger dis-
placement causes the problem to become nonlinear, and requires numerical solution of the
differential equation (i.e., the transient response results of Chapter 5 no longer apply). This

issue is explored in the homework problems.

Practical Facts About Solenoids

Solenoids can be used to produce linear or rotary
motion, in either the push or the pull mode. The most
common solenoid types are listed here:

1.

Single-action linear (push or pull). Linear stroke
motion, with a restoring force (e.g., from a
spring), to return the solenoid to the neutral
position.

Double-acting linear. Two solenoids back to
back can act in either direction. Restoring force
is provided by another mechanism (e.g., a
spring).

Mechanical latching solenoid (bistable). An
internal latching mechanism holds the solenoid
in place against the load.

Keep solenoid. Fitted with a permanent magnet
so that no power is needed to hold the load in the
pulled-in position. Plunger is released by apply-
ing a current pulse of opposite polarity to that
required to pull in the plunger.

Rotary solenoid. Constructed to permit rotary
travel. Typical range is 25 to 95°. Return action
via mechanical means (e.g., a spring).

Reversing rotary solenoid. Rotary motion is
from one end to the other; when the solenoid
is energized again, it reverses direction.

Solenoid power ratings are dependent
primarily on the current required by the coil, and
on the coil resistance. The /*R is the primary
power sink, and solenoids are therefore limited
by the heat they can dissipate. Solenoids can
operate in continuous or pulsed mode. The
power rating depends on the mode of opera-
tion, and can be increased by adding hold-in
resistors to the circuit to reduce the holding
current required for continuous operation. The
hold resistor is switched into the circuit once the
pull-in current required to pull the plunger has
been applied and the plunger has moved into
place. The holding current can be significantly
smaller than the pull-in current.

Acommon method to reduce the solenoid
holding current employs anormally closed (NC)
switch in parallel with a hold-in resistor.

Another electromechanical device that finds common application in industrial FIND IT
practice is the relay. The relay is essentially an electromechanical switch that permits
the opening and closing of electrical contacts by means of an electromagnetic structure
similar to those discussed earlier in this section. ON THE WEB

A relay such as would be used to start a high-voltage single-phase motor is
shown in Figure 13.39. The magnetic structure has dimensions equal to 1 cm on
all sides, and the transverse dimension is 8 cm. The relay works as follows. When
the pushbutton is pressed, an electric current flows through the coil and generates a
field in the magnetic structure. The resulting force draws the movable part toward
the fixed part, causing an electrical contact to be made. The advantage of the relay is
that a relatively low-level current can be used to control the opening and closing of a
circuit that can carry large currents. In this particular example, the relay is energized
by a 120-V AC contact, establishing a connection in a 240-V AC circuit. Such relay
circuits are commonly employed to remotely switch large industrial loads.

Circuit symbols for relays are shown in Figure 13.40. An example of the calcu-
lations that would typically be required in determining the mechanical and electrical
characteristics of a simple relay are given in Example 13.12.

Moving-Coil Transducers

Another important class of electromagnetomechanical transducers is that of moving-
coil transducers. This class of transducers includes a number of common devices,
such as microphones, loudspeakers, and all electric motors and generators. The aim of
this section is to explain the relationship between a fixed magnetic field, the emf across
the moving coil, and the forces and motions of the moving element of the transducer.

The basic principle of operation of electromechanical transducers was presented
in Section 13.1, where we stated that a magnetic field exerts a force on a charge moving
through it. The equation describing this effect is

f=gquxB (13.51)

which is a vector equation, as explained earlier. To correctly interpret equation 13.51,
we must recall the right-hand rule and apply it to the transducer, illustrated in

Motor Action

A moving-coil transducer can act as a motor when an externally supplied current
flowing through the electrically conducting part of the transducer is converted to a
force that can cause the moving part of the transducer to be displaced. Such a current
would flow, for example, if the support of Figure 13.42 were made of conducting
material, so that the conductor and the right-hand side of the support “rail” were to
form a loop (in effect, a 1-turn coil). To understand the effects of this current flow in
the conductor, one must consider the fact that a charge moving at a velocity wu’ (along
the conductor and perpendicular to the velocity of the conducting bar, as shown in
Figure 13.43) corresponds to a current i = dq/dt along the length / of the conductor.
This fact can be explained by considering the current i along a differential element

Part III Electromechanics

dl and writing
d
id= wa (13.52)
dt
since the differential element d/ would be traversed by the current in time dt at a
velocity u’. Thus we can write
idl =dqu' (13.53)
or
il = qu (13.54)
for the geometry of Figure 13.43. From Section 13.1, the force developed by a charge
moving in a magnetic field is, in general, given by
f=gquxB (13.55)
For the term qu’ we can substitute il, to obtain
f'=ilxB (13.56)

Using the right-hand rule, we determine that the force f’ generated by the current
i is in the direction that would push the conducting bar to the left. The magnitude
of this force is f’ = Bli if the magnetic field and the direction of the current are
perpendicular. If they are not, then we must consider the angle y formed by B and 1;
in the more general case,

f’ =Blisiny = Bliif y = 90° Bli law (13.57)

The phenomenon we have just described is sometimes referred to as the Bli law.

Generator Action

The other mode of operation of a moving-coil transducer occurs when an external
force causes the coil (i.e., the moving bar, in Figure 13.42) to be displaced. This
external force is converted to an emf across the coil, as will be explained in the
following paragraphs.

Since positive and negative charges are forced in opposite directions in the
transducer of Figure 13.42, a potential difference will appear across the conducting
bar; this potential difference is the electromotive force, or emf. The emf must be equal
to the force exerted by the magnetic field. In short, the electric force per unit charge
(or electric field) e// must equal the magnetic force per unit charge f /q = Bu. Thus,
the relationship

holds whenever B, 1, and u are mutually perpendicular, as in Figure 13.44. If
equation 13.58 is analyzed in greater depth, it can be seen that the product /u (length
times velocity) is the area crossed per unit time by the conductor. If one visualizes the
conductor as “cutting” the flux lines into the base in Figure 13.43, it can be concluded
that the electromotive force is equal to the rate at which the conductor “cuts” the

( LO5

( LO5

630

Chapter 13 Principles of Electromechanics

magnetic lines of flux. It will be useful for you to carefully absorb this notion of
conductors cutting lines of flux, since this will greatly simplify the understanding of
the material in this section and in Chapter 14.

In general, B, 1, and u are not necessarily perpendicular. In this case one
needs to consider the angles formed by the magnetic field with the normal to the
plane containing | and u, and the angle between | and u. The former is angle a of
Figure 13.44; the latter is angle 6 in the same figure. It should be apparent that
the optimum values of a and f are 0° and 90°, respectively. Thus, most practical
devices are constructed with these values of a and f. Unless otherwise noted, it will
be tacitly assumed that this is the case. The Bli law just illustrated explains how a
moving conductor in a magnetic field can generate an electromotive force.

To summarize the electromechanical energy conversion that takes place in the
simple device of Figure 13.42, we must note now that the presence of a current in
the loop formed by the conductor and the rail requires that the conductor move to the
right at a velocity u (Blu law), thus cutting the lines of flux and generating the emf
that gives rise to current i. On the other hand, the same current causes a force f’ to
be exerted on the conductor (Bli law) in the direction opposite to the movement of the
conductor. Thus, it is necessary that an externally applied force f.x, exist to cause the
conductor to move to the right with a velocity u. The external force must overcome
the force f’. This is the basis of electromechanical energy conversion.

An additional observation we must make at this point is that the current 7 flowing
around a closed loop generates a magnetic field, as explained in Section 13.1. Since
this additional field is generated by a 1-turn coil in our illustration, it is reasonable to
assume that itis negligible with respect to the field already present (perhaps established
by apermanent magnet). Finally, we must consider that this coil links a certain amount
of flux, which changes as the conductor moves from left to right. The area crossed by
the moving conductor in time df is

dA = ludt (13.59)

so that if the flux density B is uniform, the rate of change of the flux linked by the
1-turn coil is

dp =B aa = Blu (13.60)

dt dt
In other words, the rate of change of the flux linked by the conducting loop is equal
to the emf generated in the conductor. You should realize that this statement simply
confirms Faraday’s law.

It was briefly mentioned that the Blu and Bli laws indicate that, thanks to
the coupling action of the magnetic field, a conversion of mechanical to electrical
energy—or the converse—is possible. The simple structures of Figures 13.42 and
13.43 can, again, serve as an illustration of this energy conversion process, although
we have not yet indicated how these idealized structures can be converted to a practical
device. In this section we begin to introduce some physical considerations. Before we
proceed any further, we should try to compute the power—electric and mechanical—
that is generated (or is required) by our ideal transducer. The electric power is given
by

Pr =ei = Blui W (13.61)

while the mechanical power required, say, to move the conductor from left to right is
given by the product of force and velocity:

Pu —featt = Bliu W (13.62)

Part III Electromechanics

The principle of conservation of energy thus states that in this ideal (lossless)
transducer we can convert a given amount of electric energy to mechanical energy, or
vice versa. Once again we can utilize the same structure of Figure 13.42 to illustrate
this reversible action. If the closed path containing the moving conductor is now
formed from a closed circuit containing a resistance R and a battery Vg, as shown
in Figure 13.45, the externally applied force f.., generates a positive current 7 into
the battery provided that the emf is greater than Vg. When e = Blu > Vz, the ideal
transducer acts as a generator. For any given set of values of B,/, R, and Vz, there
will exist a velocity u for which the current i is positive. If the velocity is lower than
this value—that is, if e = Blu < Vg—then the current i is negative, and the conductor
is forced to move to the right. In this case the battery acts as a source of energy and
the transducer acts as a motor (i.e., electric energy drives the mechanical motion).

In practical transducers, we must be concerned with the inertia, friction, and
elastic forces that are invariably present on the mechanical side of the transducer.
Similarly, on the electrical side we must account for the inductance of the circuit, its
resistance, and possibly some capacitance. Consider the structure of Figure 13.46.
In the figure, the conducting bar has been placed on a surface with a coefficient of
sliding friction b; it has a mass m and is attached to a fixed structure by means of a
spring with spring constant k. The equivalent circuit representing the coil inductance
and resistance is also shown.

If we recognize that u = dx/dt in the figure, we can write the equation of
motion for the conductor as

mT but © [ude =F = Bi (13.63)
dt k

where the Bli term represents the driving input that causes the mass to move. The
driving input in this case is provided by the electric energy source vs; thus the trans-
ducer acts as a motor, and f is the electromechanical force acting on the mass of the
conductor. On the electrical side, the circuit equation is

di

us —L — Ri =e = Blu (13.64)
dt

Equations 13.63 and 13.64 could then be solved by knowing the excitation voltage

vs and the physical parameters of the mechanical and electric circuits. For example,

if the excitation voltage were sinusoidal, with

vs(t) = Vs cos wt
and the field density were constant
B= Bo

then we could postulate sinusoidal solutions for the transducer velocity u and
current 7:

u = Ucos(wt + 6,) i= Icos(wt + 6) (13.65)

and use phasor notation to solve for the unknowns (U, J, 6,, 6;).

The results obtained in the present section apply directly to transducers that are
based on translational (linear) motion. These basic principles of electromechanical
energy conversion and the analysis methods developed in the section will be applied
to practical transducers in a few examples. A Focus on Methodology box outlines the
analysis procedure for moving-coil transducers.

Analysis: To determine the frequency response of the loudspeaker, we write the differential
equations that describe the electrical and mechanical subsystems. We apply KVL to the electric
circuit, using the circuit model of Figure 13.49, in which we have represented the Blu term
(motional voltage) in the form of a back electromotive force e:

Next, we apply Newton’s second law to the mechanical system, consisting of a lumped mass
representing the mass of the moving diaphragm m; an elastic (spring) term, which represents
the elasticity of the diaphragm k; and a damping coefficient b, representing the frictional losses
and aerodynamic damping affecting the moving diaphragm.

Note that the two equations are coupled; that is, a mechanical variable appears in the electrical
equation (velocity u in the Blu term), and an electrical variable appears in the mechanical

To derive the frequency response, we use the Laplace transform on the two equations to
obtain

Conclusion

This chapter introduces electromechanical systems. Electromechanical devices include a
variety of sensors and transducers that find common engineering application in many fields.
All electromechanical devices use the coupling between mechanical and electrical systems
provided by a magnetic field. This magnetic coupling makes it possible to convert energy
from electric to mechanical form, and back. Devices that convert electric to mechanical
energy include all forms of electromagnetomechanical actuators, such as electromagnets,
solenoids, relays, electrodynamic shakers, linear motors, and loudspeakers. Conversion from
mechanical to electric energy results in generators, and various sensors that can detect
mechanical displacement, velocity, or acceleration. Upon completing this chapter, you should
have mastered the following learning objectives:

1. Review the basic principles of electricity and magnetism. The basic laws that govern
electromagnetomechanical energy conversion are Faraday’s law, stating that a changing
magnetic field can induce a voltage, and Ampére’s law, stating that a current flowing
through a conductor generates a magnetic field.

2. Use the concepts of reluctance and magnetic circuit equivalents to compute magnetic
flux and currents in simple magnetic structures. The two fundamental variables in the
analysis of magnetic structures are the magnetomotive force and the magnetic flux;
if some simplifying approximations are made, these quantities are linearly related
through the reluctance parameter, in much the same way as voltage and current
are related through resistance according to Ohm’s law. This simplified analysis
permits approximate calculation of forces and currents in electromagnetomechanical
structures.

3. Understand the properties of magnetic materials and their effects on magnetic circuit
models. Magnetic materials are characterized by a number of nonideal properties, which
must be considered in a detailed analysis of any electromechanical transducer. The most
important phenomena are saturation, eddy currents, and hysteresis.

4. Use magnetic circuit models to analyze transformers. One of the most common magnetic
structures in use in electric power systems is the transformer. The methods developed in
the earlier sections provide all the tools needed to perform an analysis of these important
devices.

5. Model and analyze force generation in electromagnetomechanical systems. Analyze
moving-iron transducers (electromagnets, solenoids, relays) and moving-coil
transducers (electrodynamic shakers, loudspeakers, and seismic transducers).
Electromagnetomechanical transducers can be broadly divided into two categories:
moving-iron transducers, which include all electromagnets, solenoids, and relays;
and moving-coil transducers, which include loudspeakers, electrodynamic shakers,
and all electric motors. Section 13.5 develops analysis and design methods for these
devices.

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRIC
MACHINES

he objective of this chapter is to introduce the basic operation of rotating

electric machines. The operation of the three major classes of electric

machines—DC, synchronous, and induction—first is described as intuitively

as possible, building on the material presented in Chapter 13. The second part
of the chapter is devoted to a discussion of the applications and selection criteria
for the different classes of machines.

The emphasis of this chapter is on explaining the properties of each type of
machine, with its advantages and disadvantages with regard to other types; and on
classifying these machines in terms of their performance characteristics and preferred
field of application.

14.1. ROTATING ELECTRIC MACHINES

The range of sizes and power ratings and the different physical features of rotating
machines are such that the task of explaining the operation of rotating machines in
a single chapter may appear formidable at first. Some features of rotating machines,
however, are common to all such devices. This introductory section is aimed at
explaining the common properties of all rotating electric machines. We begin our
discussion with reference to Figure 14.1, in which a hypothetical rotating machine
is depicted in a cross-sectional view. In the figure, a box with a cross inscribed in
it indicates current flowing into the page, while a dot represents current out of the
plane of the page.

In Figure 14.1, we identify a stator, of cylindrical shape, and a rotor, which, as
the name indicates, rotates inside the stator, separated from the latter by means of an
air gap. The rotor and stator each consist of a magnetic core, some electrical insulation,
and the windings necessary to establish a magnetic flux (unless this is created by a
permanent magnet). The rotor is mounted on a bearing-supported shaft, which can
be connected to mechanical loads (if the machine is a motor) or to a prime mover (if
the machine is a generator) by means of belts, pulleys, chains, or other mechanical
couplings. The windings carry the electric currents that generate the magnetic fields
and flow to the electrical loads, and also provide the closed loops in which voltages
will be induced (by virtue of Faraday’s law, as discussed in Chapter 13).

Basic Classification of Electric Machines

An immediate distinction can be made between different types of windings charac-
terized by the nature of the current they carry. If the current serves the sole purpose of
providing a magnetic field and is independent of the load, it is called a magnetizing,
or excitation, current, and the winding is termed a field winding. Field currents
are nearly always direct current (DC) and are of relatively low power, since their
only purpose is to magnetize the core (recall the important role of high-permeability
cores in generating large magnetic fluxes from relatively small currents). On the
other hand, if the winding carries only the load current, it is called an armature. In
DC and alternating-current (AC) synchronous machines, separate windings exist to
carry field and armature currents. In the induction motor, the magnetizing and load
currents flow in the same winding, called the input winding, or primary; the output
winding is then called the secondary. As we shall see, this terminology, which is

Part III Electromechanics

reminiscent of transformers, is particularly appropriate for induction motors, which
bear a significant analogy to the operation of the transformers studied in Chapters 7
and 13. Table 14.1 characterizes the principal machines in terms of their field and
armature configuration.

It is also useful to classify electric machines in terms of their energy conversion
characteristics. A machine acts as a generator if it converts mechanical energy from
a prime mover, say, an internal combustion engine, to electrical form. Examples of
generators are the large machines used in power generating plants, or the common
automotive alternator. A machine is classified as a motor if it converts electrical
energy to mechanical form. The latter class of machines is probably of more direct
interest to you, because of its widespread application in engineering practice. Electric
motors are used to provide forces and torques to generate motion in countless industrial
applications. Machine tools, robots, punches, presses, mills, and propulsion systems
for electric vehicles are but a few examples of the application of electric machines in
engineering.

Note that in Figure 14.1 we have explicitly shown the direction of two
magnetic fields: that of the rotor Br and that of the stator Bs. Although these fields
are generated by different means in different machines (e.g., permanent magnets,
alternating currents, direct currents), the presence of these fields is what causes a
rotating machine to turn and enables the generation of electric power. In particular,
we see that in Figure 14.1 the north pole of the rotor field will seek to align itself
with the south pole of the stator field. It is this magnetic attraction force that permits
the generation of torque in an electric motor; conversely, a generator exploits the
laws of electromagnetic induction to convert a changing magnetic field to an electric
current.

To simplify the discussion in later sections, we now introduce some basic con-
cepts that apply to all rotating electric machines. Referring to Figure 14.2, we note
that for all machines the force on a wire is given by the expression

f =i,1 xB (14.1)
where i,, is the current in the wire, ] is a vector along the direction of the wire, and x
denotes the cross product of two vectors. Then the torque for a multiturn coil becomes

T = KBi, sina (14.2)
where

B = magnetic flux density caused by stator field

Figure 14.2 Stator and rotor fields and the force acting on a
rotating machine

In the hypothetical machine of Figure 14.2, there are two magnetic fields: one
generated within the stator, the other within the rotor windings. Either (but not both)
of these fields could be generated by a current or by a permanent magnet. Thus, we
could replace the permanent-magnet stator of Figure 14.2 with a suitably arranged
winding to generate a stator field in the same direction. If the stator were made of
a toroidal coil of radius R (see Chapter 13), then the magnetic field of the stator
would generate a flux density B, where
Ni

B=wuH = UR (14.3)
and where N is the number of turns and i is the coil current. The direction of the
torque is always the direction determined by the rotor and stator fields as they seek
to align to each other (i.e., counterclockwise in the diagram of Figure 14.1).

It is important to note that Figure 14.2 is merely a general indication of the
major features and characteristics of rotating machines. A variety of configurations
exist, depending on whether each of the fields is generated by a current in a coil or
by a permanent magnet and whether the load and magnetizing currents are direct or
alternating. The type of excitation (AC or DC) provided to the windings permits a first
classification of electric machines (see Table 14.1). According to this classification,
one can define the following types of machines:

* Direct-current machines: DC in both stator and rotor

* Synchronous machines: AC in one winding, DC in the other

¢ Induction machines: AC in both

In most industrial applications, the induction machine is the preferred choice, because
of the simplicity of its construction. However, the analysis of the performance of
an induction machine is rather complex. On the other hand, DC machines are quite
complex in their construction but can be analyzed relatively simply with the analytical
tools we have already acquired. Therefore, the progression of this chapter is as follows.
We start with a section that discusses the physical construction of DC machines, both

Part III Electromechanics

motors and generators. Then we continue with a discussion of synchronous machines,
in which one of the currents is now alternating, since these can easily be understood
as an extension of DC machines. Finally, we consider the case where both rotor and
stator currents are alternating, and we analyze the induction machine.

Performance Characteristics of Electric Machines

As already stated earlier in this chapter, electric machines are energy conversion
devices, and we are therefore interested in their energy conversion efficiency. Typical
applications of electric machines as motors or generators must take into consideration
the energy losses associated with these devices. Figure 14.3(a) and (b) represents the
various loss mechanisms you must consider in analyzing the efficiency of an electric
machine for the case of direct-current machines. It is important for you to keep in
mind this conceptual flow of energy when analyzing electric machines. The sources of
loss in a rotating machine can be separated into three fundamental groups: electrical
(I’R) losses, core losses, and mechanical losses.

Usually /?R losses are computed on the basis of the DC resistance of the wind-
ings at 75°C; in practice, these losses vary with operating conditions. The difference

Chapter 14 Introduction to Electric Machines

between the nominal and actual /?R loss is usually lumped under the category of
stray-load loss. \n direct-current machines, it is also necessary to account for the
brush contact loss associated with slip rings and commutators.

Mechanical losses are due to friction (mostly in the bearings) and windage,
that is, the air drag force that opposes the motion of the rotor. In addition, if external
devices (e.g., blowers) are required to circulate air through the machine for cooling
purposes, the energy expended by these devices is included in the mechanical losses.

Open-circuit core losses consist of hysteresis and eddy current losses, with only
the excitation winding energized (see Chapter 13 for a discussion of hysteresis and
eddy currents). Often these losses are summed with friction and windage losses to
give rise to the no-load rotational loss. The latter quantity is useful if one simply
wishes to compute efficiency. Since open-circuit core losses do not account for the
changes in flux density caused by the presence of load currents, an additional magnetic
loss is incurred that is not accounted for in this term. Stray-load losses are used to
lump the effects of nonideal current distribution in the windings and of the additional
core losses just mentioned. Stray-load losses are difficult to determine exactly and are
often assumed to be equal to 1.0 percent of the output power for DC machines; these
losses can be determined by experiment in synchronous and induction machines.

The performance of an electric machine can be quantified in a number of ways.
In the case of an electric motor, it is usually portrayed in the form of a graphical
torque-speed characteristic and efficiency map. The torque—speed characteristic
of a motor describes how the torque supplied by the machine varies as a function
of the speed of rotation of the motor for steady speeds. As we shall see in later
sections, the torque—speed curves vary in shape with the type of motor (DC, induction,
synchronous) and are very useful in determining the performance of the motor when
connected to a mechanical load. Figure 14.4(a) depicts the torque—speed curve of a
hypothetical motor. Figure 14.4(b) depicts a typical efficiency map for a DC machine.
In most engineering applications, it is quite likely that the engineer is required to
make a decision regarding the performance characteristics of the motor best suited to
a specified task. In this context, the torque—speed curve of a machine is a very useful
piece of information.

The first feature we note of the torque—speed characteristic is that it bears a
strong resemblance to the i-v characteristics used in earlier chapters to represent the

behavior of electrical sources. It should be clear that, according to this torque—speed
curve, the motor is not an ideal source of torque (if it were, the curve would appear
as a horizontal line across the speed range). One can readily see, for example, that
the hypothetical motor represented by the curves of Figure 14.4(a) would produce
maximum torque in the range of speeds between approximately 800 and 1,400 r/min.
What determines the actual speed of the motor (and therefore its output torque and
power) is the torque—speed characteristic of the load connected to it, much as a resistive
load determines the current drawn from a voltage source. In the figure, we display
the torque—speed curve of a load, represented by the dashed line; the operating point
of the motor-load pair is determined by the intersection of the two curves.

Another important observation pertains to the fact that the motor of Figure 14.4(a)
produces a nonzero torque at zero speed. This fact implies that as soon as electric
power is connected to the motor, the latter is capable of supplying a certain amount
of torque; this zero-speed torque is called the starting torque. If the load the motor is
connected to requires less than the starting torque the motor can provide, then the mo-
tor can accelerate the load, until the motor speed and torque settle to a stable value, at
the operating point. The motor-load pair of Figure 14.4(a) would behave in the manner
just described. However, there may well be circumstances in which a motor might not
be able to provide a sufficient starting torque to overcome the static load torque that
opposes its motion. Thus, we see that a torque—speed characteristic can offer valuable
insight into the operation of a motor. As we discuss each type of machine in greater
detail, we shall devote some time to the discussion of its torque—speed curve.

The efficiency of an electric machine is also an important design and per-
formance characteristic. The 1995 Department of Energy Energy Policy Act, also
known as EPACT, has required electric motor manufacturers to guarantee a minimum
efficiency. The efficiency of an electric motor is usually described using a contour
plot of the efficiency value (a number between 0 and 1) in the torque—speed plane.
This representation permits a determination of the motor efficiency as a function of
its performance and operating conditions. Figure 14.4(b) depicts the efficiency map
of an electric drive used in a hybrid-electric vehicle—a 20-kW permanent-magnet
AC (or brushless DC) machine. Note that the peak efficiency can be as high as 0.95
(95 percent), but that the efficiency decreases significantly away from the optimum
point (around 3,500 r/min and 45 N-m), to values as low as 0.65.

The most common means of conveying information regarding electric machines
is the nameplate. Typical information conveyed by the nameplate includes

Rated speed and horsepower

The rated voltage is the terminal voltage for which the machine was designed,
and which will provide the desired magnetic flux. Operation at higher voltages
will increase magnetic core losses, because of excessive core saturation. The rated
current and rated voltamperes are an indication of the typical current and power
levels at the terminal that will not cause undue overheating due to copper losses
(?R losses) in the windings. These ratings are not absolutely precise, but they give
an indication of the range of excitations for which the motor will perform without
overheating. Peak power operation in a motor may exceed rated torque, power, or

currents by a substantial factor (up to as much as 6 or 7 times the rated value);
however, continuous operation of the motor above the rated performance will cause
the machine to overheat and eventually to sustain damage. Thus, it is important to
consider both peak and continuous power requirements when selecting a motor for
a specific application. An analogous discussion is valid for the speed rating: While
an electric machine may operate above rated speed for limited periods of time, the
large centrifugal forces generated at high rotational speeds will eventually cause
undesirable mechanical stresses, especially in the rotor windings, leading eventually
even to self-destruction.

Another important feature of electric machines is the regulation of the machine
speed or voltage, depending on whether it is used as a motor or as a generator,
respectively. Regulation is the ability to maintain speed or voltage constant in the
face of load variations. The ability to closely regulate speed in a motor or voltage in
a generator is an important feature of electric machines; regulation is often improved
by means of feedback control mechanisms, some of which are briefly introduced in
this chapter. We take the following definitions as being adequate for the intended
purpose of this chapter:

Speed at no load — Speed at rated load

Speed regulation = (14.4)
Speed at rated load

. Voltage at no load — Voltage at rated load
Voltage regulation = (14.5)
Voltage at rated load

Please note that the rated value is usually taken to be the nameplate value, and that
the meaning of load changes depending on whether the machine is a motor, in which
case the load is mechanical, or a generator, in which case the load is electrical.

Analysis: The nameplate of a typical induction motor is shown in the preceding table. The
model number (sometimes abbreviated as MOD) uniquely identifies the motor to the manu-
facturer. It may be a style number, a model number, an identification number, or an instruction
sheet reference number.

The term frame (sometimes abbreviated as FR) refers principally to the physical size of
the machine, as well as to certain construction features.

Ambient temperature (abbreviated as AMB, or MAX. AMB) refers to the maximum
ambient temperature in which the motor is capable of operating. Operation of the motor in a
higher ambient temperature may result in shortened motor life and reduced torque.

Insulation class (abbreviated as INS. CL.) refers to the type of insulation used in the motor.
Most often used are class A (105°C) and class B (130°C).

The duty (DUTY), or time rating, denotes the length of time the motor is expected to be
able to carry the rated load under usual service conditions. “CONT.” means that the machine
can be operated continuously.

The “CODE” letter sets the limits of starting kilovoltamperes per horsepower for the
machine. There are 19 levels, denoted by the letters A through V, excluding I, O, and Q.

Service factor (abbreviated as SERV FACT) is a term defined by NEMA (the National
Electrical Manufacturers Association) as follows: “The service factor of a general-purpose
alternating-current motor is a multiplier which, when applied to the rated horsepower, indicates
a permissible horsepower loading which may be carried under the conditions specified for the
service factor.”

The voltage figure given on the nameplate refers to the voltage of the supply circuit
to which the motor should be connected. Sometimes two voltages are given, for example,
230/460. In this case, the machine is intended for use on either a 230-V or a 460-V
circuit. Special instructions will be provided for connecting the motor for each of the
voltages.

The term “BRG” indicates the nature of the bearings supporting the motor shaft.

Solution

A variable-torque variable-speed motor has a torque output that varies directly with speed;
hence, the horsepower output varies directly with the speed. Motors with this characteristic are
commonly used with fans, blowers, and centrifugal pumps. Figure 14.5 shows typical torque—
speed curves for this type of motor. Superimposed on the motor torque—speed curve is the
torque—speed curve for a typical fan where the input power to the fan varies as the cube of the
fan speed. Point A is the desired operating point, which could be determined graphically by

Basic Operation of All Rotating Machines

We have already seen in Chapter 13 how the magnetic field in electromechanical
devices provides a form of coupling between electrical and mechanical systems.
Intuitively, one can identify two aspects of this coupling, both of which play a role in
the operation of electric machines:

1. Magnetic attraction and repulsion forces generate mechanical torque.

2. The magnetic field can induce a voltage in the machine windings (coils) by
virtue of Faraday’s law.

656

Chapter 14 Introduction to Electric Machines

Thus, we may think of the operation of an electric machine in terms of either a motor
or a generator, depending on whether the input power is electrical and mechanical
power is produced (motor action), or the input power is mechanical and the output
power is electrical (generator action). Figure 14.6 illustrates the two cases graphically.

Mechanical Mechanical
output input

(a) Motor action (b) Generator action

Figure 14.6 Generator and motor action in an electric machine

The coupling magnetic field performs a dual role, which may be explained as
follows. When a current i flows through conductors placed in a magnetic field, a
force is produced on each conductor, according to equation 14.1. If these conductors
are attached to a cylindrical structure, a torque is generated; and if the structure
is free to rotate, then it will rotate at an angular velocity w,,. As the conductors
rotate, however, they move through a magnetic field and cut through flux lines, thus
generating an electromotive force in opposition to the excitation. This emf is also
called counter-emf, as it opposes the source of the current 7. If, on the other hand,
the rotating element of the machine is driven by a prime mover (e.g., an internal
combustion engine), then an emf is generated across the coil that is rotating in the
magnetic field (the armature). If a load is connected to the armature, a current 7 will
flow to the load, and this current flow will in turn cause a reaction torque on the
armature that opposes the torque imposed by the prime mover.

You see, then, that for energy conversion to take place, two elements are
required:

1. Accoupling field B; usually generated in the field winding.
2. An armature winding that supports the load current i and the emf e.

Magnetic Poles in Electric Machines

Before discussing the actual construction of a rotating machine, we should spend a few
paragraphs to illustrate the significance of magnetic poles in an electric machine.
In an electric machine, torque is developed as a consequence of magnetic forces
of attraction and repulsion between magnetic poles on the stator and on the rotor;
these poles produce a torque that accelerates the rotor and a reaction torque on the
stator. Naturally, we would like a construction such that the torque generated as a
consequence of the magnetic forces is continuous and in a constant direction. This
can be accomplished if the number of rotor poles is equal to the number of stator
poles. It is also important to observe that the number of poles must be even, since
there have to be equal numbers of north and south poles.

The motion and associated electromagnetic torque of an electric machine are
the result of two magnetic fields that are trying to align with each other so that the

Part III Electromechanics

south pole of one field attracts the north pole of the other. Figure 14.7 illustrates this

action by analogy with two permanent magnets, one of which is allowed to rotate
about its center of mass.

Figure 14.8 depicts a two-pole machine in which the stator poles are constructed
in such a way as to project closer to the rotor than to the stator structure. This type
of construction is rather common, and poles constructed in this fashion are called
salient poles. Note that the rotor could also be constructed to have salient poles.

the thumb would be pointing in the direction of the magnetic flux. Magnetic flux by
convention is viewed as entering the south pole and exiting from the north pole. Thus,
to determine whether a magnetic pole is north or south, we must consider the direction
of the flux. Figure 14.10 shows a cross section of a coil wound around a pair of salient
rotor poles. In this case, one can readily identify the direction of the magnetic flux
and therefore the magnetic polarity of the poles by applying the right-hand rule, as
illustrated in the figure.

Often, however, the coil windings are not arranged as simply as in the case of
salient poles. In many machines, the windings are embedded in slots cut into the stator
or rotor, so that the situation is similar to that of the stator depicted in Figure 14.11. This
figure is a cross section in which the wire connections between “crosses” and “dots”
have been cut away. In Figure 14.11, the dashed line indicates the axis of the stator
flux according to the right-hand rule, showing that the slotted stator in effect behaves
as a pole pair. The north and south poles indicated in the figure are a consequence
of the fact that the flux exits the bottom part of the structure (thus, the north pole
indicated in the figure) and enters the top half of the structure (thus, the south pole).
In particular, if you consider that the windings are arranged so that the current entering
the right-hand side of the stator (to the right of the dashed line) flows through the
back end of the stator and then flows outward from the left-hand side of the stator
slots (left of the dashed line), you can visualize the windings in the slots as behaving
in a manner similar to the coils of Figure 14.10, where the flux axis of Figure 14.11
corresponds to the flux axis of each of the coils of Figure 14.10. The actual circuit
that permits current flow is completed by the front and back ends of the stator, where
the wires are connected according to the pattern a-a’, b-b’, c-c’, as depicted in the
figure.

Another important consideration that facilitates understanding of the operation
of electric machines pertains to the use of alternating currents. It should be apparent
by now that if the current flowing into the slotted stator is alternating, the direction of
the flux will also alternate, so that in effect the two poles will reverse polarity every
time the current reverses direction, that is, every half-cycle of the sinusoidal current.
Further—since the magnetic flux is approximately proportional to the current in the
coil—as the amplitude of the current oscillates in a sinusoidal fashion, so will the
flux density in the structure. Thus, the magnetic field developed in the stator changes
both spatially and in time.

This property is typical of AC machines, where a rotating magnetic field is
established by energizing the coil with an alternating current. As we shall see in
Section 14.2, the principles underlying the operation of DC and AC machines are
quite different: In a direct-current machine, there is no rotating field, but a mechanical
switching arrangement (the commutator) makes it possible for the rotor and stator
magnetic fields to always align at right angles to each other.

The book website includes two-dimensional “movies” of the most common
types of electric machines. You might wish to explore these animations to better
understand the basic concepts described in this section.

14.2. DIRECT-CURRENT MACHINES

As explained in the introductory section, direct-current machines are easier to analyze
than their AC counterparts, although their actual construction is made rather complex
by the need to have acommutator, which reverses the direction of currents and fluxes to

Part III Electromechanics

produce a net torque. The objective of this section is to describe the major construction
features and the operation of direct-current machines, as well as to develop simple
circuit models that are useful in analyzing the performance of this class of machines.

Physical Structure of DC Machines

A representative DC machine was depicted in Figure 14.8, with the magnetic poles
clearly identified, for both the stator and the rotor. Figure 14.12 is a photograph of the
same type of machine. Note the salient pole construction of the stator and the slotted
rotor. As previously stated, the torque developed by the machine is a consequence of
the magnetic forces between stator and rotor poles. This torque is maximum when
the angle y between the rotor and stator poles is 90°. Also, as you can see from the
figure, ina DC machine the armature is usually on the rotor, and the field winding is
on the stator.

To keep this torque angle constant as the rotor spins on its shaft, a mechanical
switch, called a commutator, is configured so the current distribution in the rotor
winding remains constant, and therefore the rotor poles are consistently at 90° with
respect to the fixed stator poles. In a DC machine, the magnetizing current is DC,
so that there is no spatial alternation of the stator poles due to time-varying currents.
To understand the operation of the commutator, consider the simplified diagram of
Figure 14.13. In the figure, the brushes are fixed, and the rotor revolves at an angular
velocity w,,; the instantaneous position of the rotor is given by the expression 0 =
Omt — /y.

The commutator is fixed to the rotor and is made up in this example of six
segments that are made of electrically conducting material but are insulated from

one another. Further, the rotor windings are configured so that they form six coils,
connected to the commutator segments as shown in Figure 14.13.

As the commutator rotates counterclockwise, the rotor magnetic field rotates
with it up to 9 = 30°. At that point, the direction of the current changes in coils
L, and L¢ as the brushes make contact with the next segment. Now the direction of
the magnetic field is —30°. As the commutator continues to rotate, the direction of
the rotor field will again change from —30° to +30°, and it will switch again when the
brushes switch to the next pair of segments. In this machine, then, the torque angle y
is not always 90°, but can vary by as much as 30°; the actual torque produced by the
machine would fluctuate by as much as +14 percent, since the torque is proportional
to sin y. As the number of segments increases, the torque fluctuation produced by the
commutation is greatly reduced. In a practical machine, for example, one might have
as many as 60 segments, and the variation of y from 90° would be only =+:3°, with a
torque fluctuation of less than | percent. Thus, the DC machine can produce a nearly
constant torque (as a motor) or voltage (as a generator).

Configuration of DC Machines

In DC machines, the field excitation that provides the magnetizing current is
occasionally provided by an external source, in which case the machine is said to
be separately excited [Figure 14.14(a)]. More often, the field excitation is derived
from the armature voltage, and the machine is said to be self-excited. The latter
configuration does not require the use of a separate source for the field excitation
and is therefore frequently preferred. If a machine is in the separately excited
configuration, an additional source VW is required. In the self-excited case, one
method used to provide the field excitation is to connect the field in parallel with the
armature; since the field winding typically has significantly higher resistance than
the armature circuit (remember that it is the armature that carries the load current),
this will not draw excessive current from the armature. Further, a series resistor can
be added to the field circuit to provide the means for adjusting the field current
independent of the armature voltage. This configuration is called a shunt-connected
machine and is depicted in Figure 14.14(b). Another method for self-exciting a DC
machine consists of connecting the field in series with the armature, leading to
the series-connected machine, depicted in Figure 14.14(c); in this case, the field

Part III Electromechanics

winding will support the entire armature current, and thus the field coil must have
low resistance (and therefore relatively few turns). This configuration is rarely used
for generators, since the generated voltage and the load voltage must always differ
by the voltage drop across the field coil, which varies with the load current. Thus,
a series generator would have poor (large) regulation. However, series-connected
motors are commonly used in certain applications, as will be discussed in a later
section.

The third type of DC machine is the compound-connected machine, which
consists of a combination of the shunt and series configurations. Figure 14.14(d)
and (e) shows the two types of connections, called the short shunt and the long
shunt, respectively. Each of these configurations may be connected so that the series
part of the field adds to the shunt part (cumulative compounding) or so that it
subtracts (differential compounding).

DC Machine Models

As stated earlier, it is relatively easy to develop a simple model of a DC machine,
which is well suited to performance analysis, without the need to resort to the details of
the construction of the machine itself. This section illustrates the development of such
models in two steps. First, steady-state models relating field and armature currents
and voltages to speed and torque are introduced; second, the differential equations
describing the dynamic behavior of DC machines are derived.

When a field excitation is established, a magnetic flux ¢ is generated by the
field current Jy. From equation 14.2, we know that the torque acting on the rotor is
proportional to the product of the magnetic field and the current in the load-carrying
wire; the latter current is the armature current J, (i, in equation 14.2). Assuming
that, by virtue of the commutator, the torque angle y is kept very close to 90°, and
therefore sin y = 1, we obtain the following expression for the torque (in units of
newton-meters) in a DC machine:

T =kroly for y = 90° DC machine torque (14.6)

You may recall that this is simply a consequence of the Bli law of Chapter 13. The
mechanical power generated (or absorbed) is equal to the product of the machine
torque and the mechanical speed of rotation w,, rad/s, and is therefore given by

Pin = Onl = Onkrola (14.7)

Recall now that the rotation of the armature conductors in the field generated by the
field excitation causes a back emf E, in a direction that opposes the rotation of the
armature. According to the Blu law (see Chapter 13), then, this back emf is given by

Ey = kghOmn DC machine back emf (14.8)

where k, is called the armature constant and is related to the geometry and magnetic
properties of the structure. The voltage E;,, represents a countervoltage (opposing the
DC excitation) in the case of a motor and the generated voltage in the case of a
generator. Thus, the electric power dissipated (or generated) by the machine is given

by the product of the back emf and the armature current:
P. = Epla (14.9)

The constants ky and k, in equations 14.6 and 14.8 are related to geometry factors,
such as the dimension of the rotor and the number of turns in the armature winding;
and to properties of materials, such as the permeability of the magnetic materials.
Note that in the ideal energy conversion case P,, = P., and therefore k; = kr. We
shall in general assume such ideal conversion of electrical to mechanical energy (or
vice versa) and will therefore treat the two constants as being identical: k; = kr. The
constant k, is given by

_ PN

21M ( )

a

where
Pp = number of magnetic poles
N = number of conductors per coil
M = number of parallel paths in armature winding

An important observation concerning the units of angular speed must be made
at this point. The equality (under the no-loss assumption) between the constants k, and
kr in equations 14.6 and 14.8 results from the choice of consistent units, namely, volts
and amperes for the electrical quantities and newton-meters and radians per second
for the mechanical quantities. You should be aware that it is fairly common practice to
refer to the speed of rotation of an electric machine in units of revolutions per minute
(r/min).! In this book, we shall uniformly use the symbol n to denote angular speed in
revolutions per minute; the following relationship should be committed to memory:

60
n (r/min) = a om rad/s (14.11)
a

If the speed is expressed in revolutions per minute, the armature constant changes as
follows:

E, = kon (14.12)
where
iN
ki = cou (14.13)

Having introduced the basic equations relating torque, speed, voltages, and
currents in electric machines, we may now consider the interaction of these quantities
ina DC machine at steady state, that is, operating at constant speed and field excitation.
Figure 14.15 depicts the electric circuit model of a separately excited DC machine,
illustrating both motor and generator action. It is very important to note the reference
direction of armature current flow, and of the developed torque, in order to make a
distinction between the two modes of operation. The field excitation is shown as a
voltage V- generating the field current J, that flows through a variable resistor Ry
and through the field coil Ly. The variable resistor permits adjustment of the field
excitation. The armature circuit, on the other hand, consists of a voltage source
representing the back emf E,, the armature resistance R,, and the armature voltage
V,. This model is appropriate both for motor and for generator action. When V, < Ej,

'Note that the abbreviation rpm, although certainly familiar to the reader, is not a standard unit, and its
use should be discouraged.

Part III Electromechanics

the machine acts as a generator (J, flows out of the machine). When V, > Ep, the
machine acts as a motor (J, flows into the machine). Thus, according to the circuit
model of Figure 14.15, the operation of a DC machine at steady state (i.e., with
the inductors in the circuit replaced by short circuits) is described by the following
equations:

V
—lp + x =0 and Va — Ralg — Ey =0 (motor action)
(14.14)
—Tp + x =0 and Va + Rola — Ey =O (generator action)
f

Equations 14.14 together with equations 14.6 and 14.8 may be used to determine the
steady-state operating condition of a DC machine.

The circuit model of Figure 14.15 permits the derivation of a simple set of
differential equations that describe the dynamic analysis of a DC machine. The
dynamic equations describing the behavior of a separately excited DC machine are
as follows:

V,(t) —I, a (14.152)
V; a“ ) Lo,
p(t) — Ip (t)Rp — Lp ——— = 0. (field circuit) (14.15d)

These equations can be related to the operation of the machine in the presence of a
load. If we assume that the motor is rigidly connected to an inertial load with moment
of inertia J and that the friction losses in the load are represented by a viscous
friction coefficient b, then the torque developed by the machine (in the motor mode
of operation) can be written as

T(t) =T, + bo, (t) +J aA (14.16)

where 77 is the load torque. Typically 77, is either constant or some function of speed
@m in a motor. In the case of a generator, the load torque is replaced by the torque
supplied by a prime mover, and the machine torque T(t) opposes the motion of the
prime mover, as shown in Figure 14.15. Since the machine torque is related to the
armature and field currents by equation 14.6, equations 14.16 and 14.17 are coupled
to each other; this coupling may be expressed as follows:

T(t) = kagla(t) (14.17)

or

dant
kabla(t) = Ty + bOm(t) +I — @ (14.18)
The dynamic equations described in this section apply to any DC machine. In the case
of a separately excited machine, a further simplification is possible, since the flux is
established by virtue of a separate field excitation, and therefore

Nr

663

664

Chapter 14 Introduction to Electric Machines

where Nr is the number of turns in the field coil, 7 is the reluctance of the structure,
and Jy is the field current.

14.3. DIRECT-CURRENT GENERATORS

To analyze the performance of a DC generator, it would be useful to obtain an open-
circuit characteristic capable of predicting the voltage generated when the machine is
driven at a constant speed w,, by a prime mover. The common arrangement is to drive
the machine at rated speed by means of a prime mover (or an electric motor). Then,
with no load connected to the armature terminals, the armature voltage is recorded as
the field current is increased from zero to some value sufficient to produce an armature
voltage greater than the rated voltage. Since the load terminals are open-circuited,
I, = 0 and E, = V,; and since kgd = E,/wm, the magnetization curve makes it
possible to determine the value of k,@ corresponding to a given field current J; for
the rated speed.

Figure 14.16 depicts a typical magnetization curve. Note that the armature
voltage is nonzero even when no field current is present. This phenomenon is due
to the residual magnetization of the iron core. The dashed lines in Figure 14.16 are
called field resistance curves and are a plot of the voltage that appears across the field
winding plus rheostat (variable resistor; see Figure 14.15) versus the field current, for
various values of field winding plus rheostat resistance. Thus, the slope of the line is
equal to the total field circuit resistance Ry.

Figure 14.16 DC machine magnetization curve

The operation of a DC generator may be readily understood with reference
to the magnetization curve of Figure 14.16. As soon as the armature is connected
across the shunt circuit consisting of the field winding and the rheostat, a current
will flow through the winding, and this will in turn act to increase the emf across the
armature. This buildup process continues until the two curves meet, that is, until the
current flowing through the field winding is exactly that required to induce the emf.
By changing the rheostat setting, the operating point at the intersection of the two
curves can be displaced, as shown in Figure 14.16, and the generator can therefore
be made to supply different voltages. Examples 14.4 and 14.5 illustrate the operation
of the separately excited DC generator.

A separately excited DC generator is characterized by the magnetization curve of Figure 14.16.

From the magnetization curve, it can be seen that this field current will produce 100 V
at a speed of 1,000 r/min. Since this generator is actually running at 800 r/min, the
induced emf may be found by assuming a linear relationship between speed and emf.
This approximation is reasonable, provided that the departure from the nominal operating
condition is small. Let no and Eo be the nominal speed and emf, respectively (that is,
1,000 r/min and 100 V); then

Since the compound-connected generator contains both a shunt and a series
field winding, it is the most general configuration and the most useful for developing
a circuit model that is as general as possible. In the following discussion, we
consider the so-called short-shunt, compound-connected generator, in which the flux
produced by the series winding adds to that of the shunt winding. Figure 14.17
depicts the equivalent circuit for the compound generator; circuit models for the
shunt generator and for the rarely used series generator can be obtained by removing
the shunt or series field winding element, respectively. In the circuit of Figure 14.17,
the generator armature has been replaced by a voltage source corresponding
to the induced emf and a series resistance R,, corresponding to the resistance of

the armature windings. The equations describing the DC generator at steady state
(i.e., with the inductors acting as short circuits) are as follows:

Note that in the circuit of Figure 14.17, the load and armature voltages are not equal, in
general, because of the presence of a series field winding, represented by the resistor
Rs and by the inductor Ls, where the subscript S$ stands for “series.” The expression
for the armature emf is dependent on the air gap flux @ to which the series and shunt
windings in the compound generator both contribute, according to the expression

b = bn + bs = bn + ks la (14.24)

14.4 DIRECT-CURRENT MOTORS

DC motors are widely used in applications requiring accurate speed control, for
example, in servo systems. Having developed a circuit model and analysis methods
for the DC generator, we can extend these results to DC motors, since these are in
effect DC generators with the roles of input and output reversed. Once again, we
analyze the motor by means of both its magnetization curve and a circuit model.
It will be useful to begin our discussion by referring to the schematic diagram of
a cumulatively compounded motor, as shown in Figure 14.18. The choice of the
compound-connected motor is the most convenient, since its model can be used to
represent either a series or a shunt motor with minor modifications.

The equations that govern the behavior of the DC motor follow and are similar
to those used for the generator. Note that the only differences between these equations

and those that describe the DC generator appear in the last two equations in the group,
where the source voltage is equal to the sum of the emf and the voltage drop across
the series field resistance and armature resistance, and where the source current now
equals the sum of the field shunt and armature series currents.

The Shunt Motor

In a shunt motor (similar to the configuration of Figure 14.18, but with the series field
short-circuited), the armature current is found by dividing the net voltage across the
armature circuit (source voltage minus back emf) by the armature resistance:

substituting equation 14.29 in equation 14.30:

(14.31)

Equation 14.31 describes the steady-state torque—speed characteristic of the shunt
motor. To understand this performance equation, we observe that if V;, kg, @, and R,
are fixed in equation 14.31 (the flux is essentially constant in the shunt motor for
a fixed V,), then the speed of the motor is directly related to the armature current.
Now consider the case where the load applied to the motor is suddenly increased,
causing the speed of the motor to drop. As the speed decreases, the armature current
increases, according to equation 14.29. The excess armature current causes the motor
to develop additional torque, according to equation 14.30, until a new equilibrium
is reached between the higher armature current and developed torque and the lower

speed of rotation. The equilibrium point is dictated by the balance of mechanical and
electrical power, in accordance with the relation

Eplg = Tom (14.32)

Thus, the shunt DC motor will adjust to variations in load by changing its speed to
preserve this power balance. The torque—speed curves for the shunt motor may be
obtained by rewriting the equation relating the speed to the armature current:

R,T T-@ curve for
kab (kab)? shunt motor

(14.33)

To interpret equation 14.33, one can start by considering the motor operating
at rated speed and torque. As the load torque is reduced, the armature current will
also decrease, causing the speed to increase in accordance with equation 14.33. The
increase in speed depends on the extent of the voltage drop across the armature
resistance [,R,. The change in speed will be on the same order of magnitude as
this drop; it typically takes values around 10 percent. This corresponds to a relatively
good speed regulation, which is an attractive feature of the shunt DC motor (recall the
discussion of regulation in Section 14.1). Normalized torque and speed versus power
curves for the shunt motor are shown in Figure 14.19. Note that, over a reasonably
broad range of powers, up to rated value, the curve is relatively flat, indicating that
the DC shunt motor acts as a reasonably constant-speed motor.

The dynamic behavior of the shunt motor is described by equations 14.15
through 14.18, with the additional relation

Ig(t) = Is(t) — Ip) (14.34)

Compound Motors

It is interesting to compare the performance of the shunt motor with that of the
compound-connected motor; the comparison is easily made if we recall that a series

Part III Electromechanics

field resistance appears in series with the armature resistance and that the flux is due

to the contributions of both series and shunt fields. Thus, the speed equation becomes
V; —Ig(Ra + R

Om = Vs — Ta(Ra + Rs) (14.35)
ka(sn + bs)

where

A plus in the denominator is for a cumulatively compounded motor.

A minus in the denominator is for a differentially compounded motor.

Psp is the flux set up by the shunt field winding, assuming that it is constant.
ds is the flux set up by the series field winding ¢s = ksJ,.

For the cumulatively compound motor, two effects are apparent: The flux is increased
by the presence of a series component gs, and the voltage drop due to J, in the
numerator is increased by an amount proportional to the resistance of the series
field winding Rs. As a consequence, when the load to the motor is reduced, the
numerator increases more dramatically than in the case of the shunt motor, because
of the corresponding decrease in armature current, while at the same time the series
flux decreases. Each of these effects causes the speed to increase; therefore, it stands
to reason that the speed regulation of the compound-connected motor is poorer
than that of the shunt motor. Normalized torque and speed versus power curves for
the compound motor (both differential and cumulative connections) are shown in
Figure 14.19.

The differential equation describing the behavior of a compound motor dif-
fers from that for the shunt motor in having additional terms due to the series field
component:

Vs = E,(t) + Ig(t)Ra + La ou + 1;(t)Rs + Ls oA
(14.36)
dl;(t)

The differential equation for the field circuit can be written as
dl; (t
Va = Ip (t)(Rp + Ry) + Ly m (14.37)
We also have the following basic relations:
Ig(t) = 15(t) — Ip) (14.38)
and
Ey(t) =kab@m(t) = and T(t) = ka@la(t) (14.39)

Series Motors

The series motor [see Figure 14.14(c)] behaves somewhat differently from the shunt
and compound motors because the flux is established solely by virtue of the series
current flowing through the armature. It is relatively simple to derive an expression for
the emf and torque equations for the series motor if we approximate the relationship
between flux and armature current by assuming that the motor operates in the linear
region of its magnetization curve. Then we can write

6 =ksln (14.40)

671

672

Chapter 14 Introduction to Electric Machines

and the emf and torque equations become, respectively,
Ey = ka@®md = ka@mksla (14.41)
T = kala = kaksI? (14.42)
The circuit equation for the series motor becomes
V, = Ep + Ig(Ra + Rs) = (ka@mks + Rr a (14.43)

where R, is the armature resistance, Rs is the series field winding resistance, and Rr is
the total series resistance. From equation 14.43, we can solve for J, and substitute in the
torque expression (equation 14.42) to obtain the following torque—speed relationship:

Vv? T-w curve for

T= kaks (konks +Rr)2 series DC motor

(14.44)

which indicates the inverse squared relationship between torque and speed in the
series motor. This expression describes a behavior that can, under certain conditions,
become unstable. Since the speed increases when the load torque is reduced, one can
readily see that if one were to disconnect the load altogether, the speed would tend to
increase to dangerous values. To prevent excessive speeds, series motors are always
mechanically coupled to the load. This feature is not necessarily a drawback, though,
because series motors can develop very high torque at low speeds and therefore can
serve very well for traction-type loads (e.g., conveyor belts or vehicle propulsion
systems). Torque and speed versus power curves for the series motor are also shown
in Figure 14.19.

Permanent-Magnet DC Motors

Permanent-magnet (PM) DC motors have become increasingly common in applica-
tions requiring relatively low torques and efficient use of space. The construction of
PM direct-current motors differs from that of the motors considered thus far in that the
magnetic field of the stator is produced by suitably located poles made of magnetic
materials. Thus, the basic principle of operation, including the idea of commutation,
is unchanged with respect to the wound-stator DC motor. What changes is that there
is no need to provide a field excitation, whether separately or by means of the self-
excitation techniques discussed in the preceding sections. Therefore, the PM motor
is intrinsically simpler than its wound-stator counterpart.

The equations that describe the operation of the PM motor follow. The torque
produced is related to the armature current by a torque constant kpyy, which is deter-
mined by the geometry of the motor:

Part III Electromechanics

As in the conventional DC motor, the rotation of the rotor produces the usual counter
or back emf E», which is linearly related to speed by a voltage constant kg pu:

Ey = a,PMYm (14.47)

The equivalent circuit of the PM motor is particularly simple, since we need not
model the effects of a field winding. Figure 14.20 shows the circuit model and the
torque—speed curve of a PM motor.

We can use the circuit model of Figure 14.20 to predict the torque—speed curve
shown in the same figure as follows. From the circuit model, for a constant speed (and
therefore constant current), we may consider the inductor a short circuit and write the
equation

The fact that the air gap flux is constant in a permanent-magnet DC motor makes
its characteristics somewhat different from those of the wound DC motor. A direct
comparison of PM and wound-field DC motors reveals the following advantages and
disadvantages of each configuration.

LO4 ) Comparison of Wound-Field and PM DC Motors

1. PM motors are smaller and lighter than wound motors for a given power
rating. Further, their efficiency is greater because there are no field
winding losses.

2. An additional advantage of PM motors is their essentially linear
speed—torque characteristic, which makes analysis (and control) much
easier. Reversal of rotation is also accomplished easily, by reversing the
polarity of the source.

3. A major disadvantage of PM motors is that they can become
demagnetized by exposure to excessive magnetic fields, application of
excessive voltage, or operation at excessively high or low temperatures.

4. A less obvious drawback of PM motors is that their performance is
subject to greater variability from motor to motor than is the case for
wound motors, because of variations in the magnetic materials.

FIND IT In summary, four basic types of DC motors are commonly used. Their prin-
cipal operating characteristics are summarized as follows, and their general torque
and speed versus power characteristics are depicted in Figure 14.19, assuming motors
CMTE} ~= with identical voltage, power, and speed ratings.

Shunt wound motor: Field is connected in parallel with the armature. With
constant armature voltage and field excitation, the motor has good speed
regulation (flat speed—torque characteristic).

Compound wound motor: Field winding has both series and shunt
components. This motor offers better starting torque than the shunt motor, but
worse speed regulation.

Series-wound motor: The field winding is in series with the armature. The
motor has very high starting torque and poor speed regulation. It is useful for
low-speed, high-torque applications.

Permanent-magnet motor: Field windings are replaced by permanent
magnets. The motor has adequate starting torque, with speed regulation
somewhat worse than that of the compound wound motor.

DC Drives and DC Motor Speed Control

The advances made in power semiconductors have made it possible to realize low-
cost speed control systems for DC motors. In this section we describe some of the
considerations that are behind the choice of a specific drive type, and some of the
loads that are likely to be encountered.

Constant-torque loads are quite common and are characterized by a need for
constant torque over the entire speed range. This need is usually due to friction;
the load will demand increasing horsepower at higher speeds, since power is the
product of speed and torque. Thus, the power required will increase linearly with
speed. This type of loading is characteristic of conveyors, extruders, and surface
winders.

Another type of load is one that requires constant horsepower over the speed
range of the motor. Since torque is inversely proportional to speed with constant
horsepower, this type of load will require higher torque at low speeds. Examples
of constant-horsepower loads are machine tool spindles (e.g., lathes). This type of
application requires very high starting torques.

Variable-torque loads are also common. In this case, the load torque is related
to the speed in some fashion, either linearly or geometrically. For some loads, for
example, torque is proportional to the speed (and thus horsepower is proportional
to speed squared); examples of loads of this type are positive displacement pumps.
More common than the linear relationship is the squared-speed dependence of inertial
loads such as centrifugal pumps, some fans, and all loads in which a flywheel is used
for energy storage.

To select the appropriate motor and adjustable speed drive for a given appli-
cation, we need to examine how each method for speed adjustment operates on a
DC motor. Armature voltage control serves to smoothly adjust speed from 0 to 100
percent of the nameplate rated value (i.e., base speed), provided that the field excita-
tion is also equal to the rated value. Within this range, it is possible to fully control
motor speed for a constant-torque load, thus providing a linear increase in horsepower,
as shown in Figure 14.24. Field weakening allows for increases in speed of up to
several times the base speed; however, field control changes the characteristics of
the DC motor from constant torque to constant horsepower, and therefore the torque
output drops with speed, as shown in Figure 14.24. Operation above base speed
requires special provision for field control, in addition to the circuitry required for
armature voltage control, and is therefore more complex and costly.

14.5 AC MACHINES

From the previous sections, it should be apparent that it is possible to obtain a wide
range of performance characteristics from DC machines, as both motors and gener-
ators. A logical question at this point should be, Would it not be more convenient in
some cases to take advantage of the single- or multiphase AC power that is available
virtually everywhere than to expend energy and use additional hardware to rectify
and regulate the DC supplies required by direct-current motors? The answer to this
very obvious question is certainly a resounding yes. In fact, the AC induction motor
is the workhorse of many industrial applications, and synchronous generators are
used almost exclusively for the generation of electric power worldwide. Thus, it is
appropriate to devote a significant portion of this chapter to the study of AC machines
and of induction motors in particular. The objective of this section is to explain the
basic operation of both synchronous and induction machines and to outline their
performance characteristics. In doing so, we also point out the relative advantages
and disadvantages of these machines in comparison with direct-current machines. The
motor “movies” available on the book website may help you visualize the operation

of AC machines.

Rotating Magnetic Fields

As mentioned in Section 14.1, the fundamental principle of operation of AC machines
is the generation of a rotating magnetic field, which causes the rotor to turn at a speed
that depends on the speed of rotation of the magnetic field. We now explain how a
rotating magnetic field can be generated in the stator and air gap of an AC machine

by means of alternating currents.

Chapter 14 Introduction to Electric Machines

Consider the stator shown in Figure 14.25, which supports windings a-a’, b-b’
and c-c’. The coils are geometrically spaced 120° apart, and a three-phase voltage is
applied to the coils. As you may recall from the discussion of AC power in Chapter 7,
the currents generated by a three-phase source are also spaced by 120°, as illustrated
in Figure 14.26. The phase voltages referenced to the neutral terminal would then be
given by the expressions

Vag = ACOS(Q¢t)

2.

Up = Acos( ot _ =)
3
2.

Ue = Acos( ot + =)

where w, is the frequency of the AC supply, or line frequency. The coils in each
winding are arranged in such a way that the flux distribution generated by any one
winding is approximately sinusoidal. Such a flux distribution may be obtained by
appropriately arranging groups of coils for each winding over the stator surface.
Since the coils are spaced 120° apart, the flux distribution resulting from the sum of
the contributions of the three windings is the sum of the fluxes due to the separate
windings, as shown in Figure 14.27. Thus, the flux in a three-phase machine rotates
in space according to the vector diagram of Figure 14.28, and the flux is constant
in amplitude. A stationary observer on the machine’s stator would see a sinusoidally
varying flux distribution, as shown in Figure 14.27.

Since the resultant flux of Figure 14.27 is generated by the currents of Figure
14.26, the speed of rotation of the flux must be related to the frequency of the sinusoidal
phase currents. In the case of the stator of Figure 14.25, the number of magnetic poles

resulting from the winding configuration is 2; however, it is also possible to configure
the windings so that they have more poles. For example, Figure 14.29 depicts a
simplified view of a four-pole stator.

In general, the speed of the rotating magnetic field is determined by the fre-
quency of the excitation current f and by the number of poles present in the stator p
according to

where ny (or w;) is usually called the synchronous speed.

Now, the structure of the windings in the preceding discussion is the same
whether the AC machine is a motor or a generator; the distinction between the two
depends on the direction of power flow. In a generator, the electromagnetic torque is a
reaction torque that opposes rotation of the machine; this is the torque against which
the prime mover does work. In a motor, on the other hand, the rotational (motional)
voltage generated in the armature opposes the applied voltage; this voltage is the
counter (or back) emf. Thus, the description of the rotating magnetic field given thus
far applies to both motor and generator action in AC machines.

As described a few paragraphs earlier, the stator magnetic field rotates in an
AC machine, and therefore the rotor cannot “catch up” with the stator field and is in
constant pursuit of it. The speed of rotation of the rotor will therefore depend on the
number of magnetic poles present in the stator and in the rotor. The magnitude of the
torque produced in the machine is a function of the angle y between the stator and
rotor magnetic fields; precise expressions for this torque depend on how the magnetic
fields are generated and will be given separately for the two cases of synchronous and
induction machines. What is common to all rotating machines is that the number of
stator and rotor poles must be identical if any torque is to be generated. Further, the
number of poles must be even, since for each north pole there must be a corresponding
south pole.

One important desired feature in an electric machine is an ability to generate
a constant electromagnetic torque. With a constant-torque machine, one can avoid
torque pulsations that could lead to undesired mechanical vibration in the motor
itself and in other mechanical components attached to the motor (e.g., mechanical
loads, such as spindles or belt drives). A constant torque may not always be achieved,
although it will be shown that it is possible to accomplish this goal when the excitation
currents are multiphase. A general rule of thumb, in this respect, is that it is desirable,
insofar as possible, to produce a constant flux per pole.

14.6 THE ALTERNATOR (SYNCHRONOUS
GENERATOR)

One of the most common AC machines is the synchronous generator, or alternator.
In this machine, the field winding is on the rotor, and the connection is made by means

of brushes, in an arrangement similar to that of the DC machines studied earlier. The
rotor field is obtained by means of a direct current provided to the rotor winding, or
by permanent magnets. The rotor is then connected to a mechanical source of power
and rotates at a speed that we will consider constant to simplify the analysis.

Figure 14.30 depicts a two-pole three-phase synchronous machine. Figure 14.31
depicts a four-pole three-phase alternator, in which the rotor poles are generated by
means of a wound salient pole configuration and the stator poles are the result of
windings embedded in the stator according to the simplified arrangement shown in
the figure, where each of the pairs a/a’, b/b’, and so on contributes to the generation
of the magnetic poles, as follows. The group a/a’, b/b’, c/c’ produces a sinusoidally
distributed flux (see Figure 14.27) corresponding to one of the pole pairs, while the
group —a/—a’, —b/—b', —c/—c’ contributes the other pole pair. The connections
of the coils making up the windings are also shown in Figure 14.31. Note that the
coils form a wye connection (see Chapter 7). The resulting flux distribution is such
that the flux completes two sinusoidal cycles around the circumference of the air gap.
Note also that each arm of the three-phase wye connection has been divided into
two coils, wound in different locations, according to the schematic stator diagram of

Figure 14.31. One could then envision analogous configurations with greater numbers
of poles, obtained in the same fashion, that is, by dividing each arm of a wye connection
into more windings.

The arrangement shown in Figure 14.31 requires that a further distinction be
made between mechanical degrees 6,, and electrical degrees @,. In the four-pole
alternator, the flux will see two complete cycles during one rotation of the rotor,
and therefore the voltage that is generated in the coils will also oscillate at twice the
frequency of rotation. In general, the electrical degrees (or radians) are related to the
mechanical degrees by the expression

6. = 54m (14.56)

where p is the number of poles. In effect, the voltage across a coil of the machine goes
through one cycle every time a pair of poles moves past the coil. Thus, the frequency
of the voltage generated by a synchronous generator is

f= Sao Hz (14.57)

where n is the mechanical speed in revolutions per minute. Alternatively, if the speed
is expressed in radians per second, we have

@, = 5 em (14.58)

where @,, is the mechanical speed of rotation in radians per second. The number of
poles employed in a synchronous generator is then determined by two factors: the
frequency desired of the generated voltage (for example, 60 Hz, if the generator is
used to produce AC power) and the speed of rotation of the prime mover. In the latter
respect, there is a significant difference, for example, between the speed of rotation
of a steam turbine generator and that of a hydroelectric generator, the former being
much greater.

A common application of the alternator is seen in automotive battery-charging
systems, in which, however, the generated AC voltage is rectified to provide the DC
required for charging the battery. Figure 14.32 depicts an automotive alternator.

A synchronous generator has a multipolar construction that permits changing its synchronous
speed. If only two poles are energized, at 50 Hz, the speed is 3,000 r/min. If the number of
poles is progressively increased to 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, find the synchronous speed for each
configuration. Draw the complete equivalent circuit of a synchronous generator and its phasor

14.7 THE SYNCHRONOUS MOTOR

Synchronous motors are virtually identical to synchronous generators with regard
to their construction, except for an additional winding for helping start the motor
and minimizing motor speed over- and undershoots. The principle of operation is, of

course, the opposite: An AC excitation provided to the armature generates a magnetic
field in the air gap between stator and rotor, resulting in a mechanical torque. To
generate the rotor magnetic field, some direct current must be provided to the field
windings; this is often accomplished by means of an exciter, which consists of a small
DC generator propelled by the motor itself, and therefore mechanically connected to
it. It was mentioned earlier that to obtain a constant torque in an electric motor, it
is necessary to keep the rotor and stator magnetic fields constant relative to each
other. This means that the electromagnetically rotating field in the stator and the
mechanically rotating rotor field should be aligned at all times. The only condition
for which this is possible occurs if both fields are rotating at the synchronous speed
ns = 120f/p. Thus, synchronous motors are by their very nature constant-speed
motors.

For a non-salient pole (cylindrical rotor) synchronous machine, the torque
can be written in terms of the stator alternating current is(t) and the rotor direct
current, I+:

T = kis(t)Iy sin(y) Synchronous motor torque (14.59)

where y is the angle between the stator and rotor fields (see Figure 14.7). Let the
angular speed of rotation be

dOn
On = — rad/s (14.60)
dt
where @, = 27n/60, and let w, be the electrical frequency of is(t), where
is(t) = V2Is5 sin(@et). Then the torque may be expressed as
T =kV2Is sin(wt) I; sin(y) (14.61)

where k is a machine constant, Js is the rms value of the stator current, and J; is the
rotor direct current. Now, the rotor angle y can be expressed as a function of time by

y= tOnt (14.62)

where yo is the angular position of the rotor at t = 0; the torque expression then
becomes

T =kV2Isly sin(wet) sin(@mt + Yo)
J2 (14.63)
= k—>Isly cos[(@m _ Qe)t _ yol _ cos[(@m + Qe)t + vo]

It is a straightforward matter to show that the average value of this torque, denoted
by (7), is different from zero only if @,, = +@,, that is, only if the motor is turning
at the synchronous speed. The resulting average torque is then given by

(T) =kV2Isly cos(yo) (14.64)

Note that equation 14.63 corresponds to the sum of an average torque plus a fluctuating
component at twice the original electrical (or mechanical) frequency. The fluctuating
component results because, in the foregoing derivation, a single-phase current was
assumed. The use of multiphase currents reduces the torque fluctuation to zero and
permits the generation of a constant torque.

A per-phase circuit model describing the synchronous motor is shown in
Figure 14.33, where the rotor circuit is represented by a field winding equivalent

resistance and inductance, Ry and L;, respectively, and the stator circuit is represented
by equivalent stator winding inductance and resistance, Ls and Rs, respectively, and
by the induced emf £,. From the exact equivalent circuit as given in Figure 14.33,
we have

Vs = Ey +Is(Rs + jXs) (14.65)

where Xs is known as the synchronous reactance and includes magnetizing reactance.
The motor power is

for each phase, where T is the developed torque and @ is the angle between the stator
voltage and current, Vs and Js.

When the phase winding resistance Rs is neglected, the circuit model of a
synchronous machine can be redrawn as shown in Figure 14.34. The input power
(per phase) is equal to the output power in this circuit, since no power is dissipated
in the circuit; that is,

Pg = Pin = Pow = |V5|[Ts| cos(0) (14.67)
Also by inspection of Figure 14.34, we have

d = |E,| sin(é) = |Is|Xs cos(@) (14.68)
Then

|E,||Vs|sin(5) = |Vs||Is|Xs cos(@) = XsP¢ (14.69)
The total power of a three-phase synchronous machine is then given by

P= 3 Vso! sin(6d) (14.70)

Xs

Because of the dependence of the power upon the angle 6, this angle has come to be
called the power angle. If 5 is zero, the synchronous machine cannot develop useful
power. The developed power has its maximum value at 6 equal to 90°. If we assume
that |E,| and |Vs| are constant, we can draw the curve shown in Figure 14.35, relating
the power and power angle in a synchronous machine.

A synchronous generator is usually operated at a power angle varying from 15°
to 25°. For synchronous motors and small loads, 6 is close to 0°, and the motor torque
is just sufficient to overcome its own windage and friction losses; as the load increases,
the rotor field falls further out of phase with the stator field (although the two are still
rotating at the same speed), until 5 reaches a maximum at 90°. If the load torque
exceeds the maximum torque, which is produced for 6 = 90°, the motor is forced to
slow down below synchronous speed. This condition is undesirable, and provisions
are usually made to shut down the motor automatically whenever synchronism is lost.
The maximum torque is called the pull-out torque and is an important measure of
the performance of the synchronous motor.

Accounting for each of the phases, the total torque is given by

Synchronous motors are not very commonly used in practice, for various
reasons, among which are that they are essentially required to operate at constant
speed (unless a variable-frequency AC supply is available) and that they are not self-
starting. Further, separate AC and DC supplies are required. It will be seen shortly
that the induction motor overcomes most of these drawbacks.

Chapter 14 Introduction to Electric Machines

14.8. THE INDUCTION MOTOR

The induction motor is the most widely used electric machine, because of its relative
simplicity of construction. The stator winding of an induction machine is similar
to that of a synchronous machine; thus, the description of the three-phase winding
of Figure 14.25 also applies to induction machines. The primary advantage of the
induction machine, which is almost exclusively used as a motor (its performance as
a generator is not very good), is that no separate excitation is required for the rotor.
The rotor typically consists of one of two arrangements: a squirrel cage or a wound
rotor. The former contains conducting bars short-circuited at the end and embedded
within it; the latter consists of a multiphase winding similar to that used for the stator,
but electrically short-circuited.

In either case, the induction motor operates by virtue of currents induced
from the stator field in the rotor. In this respect, its operation is similar to that of a
transformer, in that currents in the stator (which acts as a primary coil) induce currents
in the rotor (acting as a secondary coil). In most induction motors, no external
electrical connection is required for the rotor, thus permitting a simple, rugged
construction without the need for slip rings or brushes. Unlike the synchronous
motor, the induction motor operates not at synchronous speed, but at a somewhat
lower speed, which is dependent on the load. Figure 14.37 illustrates the appearance

Part III Electromechanics

of a squirrel cage induction motor. The following discussion focuses mainly on this
very common configuration.

By now you are acquainted with the notion of a rotating stator magnetic field.
Imagine now that a squirrel cage rotor is inserted in a stator in which such a rotating
magnetic field is present. The stator field will induce voltages in the cage conductors,
and if the stator field is generated by a three-phase source, the resulting rotor currents—
which circulate in the bars of the squirrel cage, with the conducting path completed
by the shorting rings at the end of the cage—are also three-phase and are determined
by the magnitude of the induced voltages and by the impedance of the rotor. Since
the rotor currents are induced by the stator field, the number of poles and the speed
of rotation of the induced magnetic field are the same as those of the stator field,
if the rotor is at rest. Thus, when a stator field is initially applied, the rotor field is
synchronous with it, and the fields are stationary with respect to one another. Thus,
according to the earlier discussion, a starting torque is generated.

If the starting torque is sufficient to cause the rotor to start spinning, the rotor
will accelerate up to its operating speed. However, an induction motor can never reach
synchronous speed; if it did, the rotor would appear to be stationary with respect to the
rotating stator field, since it would be rotating at the same speed. But in the absence
of relative motion between the stator and rotor fields, no voltage would be induced
in the rotor. Thus, an induction motor is limited to speeds somewhere below the
synchronous speed n;. Let the speed of rotation of the rotor be n; then the rotor is
losing ground with respect to the rotation of the stator field at a speed n, —n. In effect,
this is equivalent to backward motion of the rotor at the slip speed, defined by n; —n.
The slip s is usually defined as a fraction of n;

Slip in induction machine (14.73)

which leads to the following expression for the rotor speed:
n=n,(1—s) (14.74)

The slip s is a function of the load, and the amount of slip in a given motor
is dependent on its construction and rotor type (squirrel cage or wound rotor). Since
there is a relative motion between the stator and rotor fields, voltages will be induced
in the rotor at a frequency called the slip frequency, related to the relative speed of
the two fields. This gives rise to an interesting phenomenon: The rotor field travels
relative to the rotor at the slip speed sm,, but the rotor is mechanically traveling at the
speed (1 — s)n;, so that the net effect is that the rotor field travels at the speed

that is, at synchronous speed. The fact that the rotor field rotates at synchronous
speed—although the rotor itself does not—is extremely important, because it means
that the stator and rotor fields will continue to be stationary with respect to each other,
and therefore a net torque can be produced.

As in the case of DC and synchronous motors, important characteristics of
induction motors are the starting torque, the maximum torque, and the torque—speed
curve. These will be discussed shortly, after some analysis of the induction motor is
performed.

Performance of Induction Motors

The performance of induction motors can be described by torque—speed curves similar
to those already used for DC motors. Figure 14.42 depicts an induction motor torque—
speed curve, with five torque ratings marked a through e. Point a is the starting torque,
also called breakaway torque, and is the torque available with the rotor “locked,”
that is, in a stationary position. At this condition, the frequency of the voltage induced
in the rotor is highest, since it is equal to the frequency of rotation of the stator field;
consequently, the inductive reactance of the rotor is greatest. As the rotor accelerates,
the torque drops off, reaching a maximum value called the pull-up torque (point b);
this typically occurs somewhere between 25 and 40 percent of synchronous speed.
As the rotor speed continues to increase, the rotor reactance decreases further (since
the frequency of the induced voltage is determined by the relative speed of rotation
of the rotor with respect to the stator field). The torque becomes a maximum when
the rotor inductive reactance is equal to the rotor resistance; maximum torque is also
called breakdown torque (point c). Beyond this point, the torque drops off, until it
is zero at synchronous speed, as discussed earlier. Also marked on the curve are the
150 percent torque (point d) and the rated torque (point e).

A general formula for the computation of the induction motor steady-state
torque—speed characteristic is

where m is the number of phases.

Different construction arrangements permit the design of induction motors
with different torque—speed curves, thus permitting the user to select the motor that
best suits a given application. Figure 14.43 depicts the four basic classifications—
classes A, B, C, and D—as defined by NEMA. The determining features in the clas-
sification are the locked-rotor torque and current, the breakdown torque, the pull-up
torque, and the percentage of slip. Class A motors have a higher breakdown torque
than class B motors, and a slip of 5 percent or less. Motors in this class are often
designed for a specific application. Class B motors are general-purpose motors; this

is the most commonly used type of induction motor, with typical values of slip of 3 to
5 percent. Class C motors have a high starting torque for a given starting current, and
a low slip. These motors are typically used in applications demanding high starting
torque but having relatively normal running loads, once the running speed has been
reached. Class D motors are characterized by high starting torque, high slip, low
starting current, and low full-load speed. A typical value of slip is around 13 percent.

Factors that should be considered in the selection of an AC motor for a given
application are the speed range, both minimum and maximum, and the speed variation.
For example, it is important to determine whether constant speed is required; what
variation might be allowed, either in speed or in torque; or whether variable-speed
operation is required, in which case a variable-speed drive will be needed. The torque
requirements are obviously important as well. The starting and running torque should
be considered; they depend on the type of load. Starting torque can vary from a
small percentage of full-load torque to several times full-load torque. Furthermore,
the excess torque available at start-up determines the acceleration characteristics of
the motor. Similarly, deceleration characteristics should be considered, to determine
whether external braking might be required.

Another factor to be considered is the duty cycle of the motor. The duty cycle,
which depends on the nature of the application, is an important consideration when
the motor is used in repetitive, noncontinuous operation, such as is encountered in
some types of machine tools. If the motor operates at zero or reduced load for periods
of time, the duty cycle—that is, the percentage of the time the motor is loaded—is an
important selection criterion. Last, but by no means least, are the heating properties
of a motor. Motor temperature is determined by internal losses and by ventilation;
motors operating at a reduced speed may not generate sufficient cooling, and forced
ventilation may be required.

Thus far, we have not considered the dynamic characteristics of induction motors.
Among the integral-horsepower induction motors (i.e., motors with horsepower rating
greater than 1), the most common dynamic problems are associated with starting and
stopping and with the ability of the motor to continue operation during supply system
transient disturbances. Dynamic analysis methods for induction motors depend to a
considerable extent on the nature and complexity of the problem and the associated
precision requirements. When the electric transients in the motor are to be included as
well as the motion transients, and especially when the motor is an important element
in a large network, the simple transient equivalent circuit of Figure 14.44 provides
a good starting approximation. In the circuit model of Figure 14.44, X{ is called
the transient reactance. The voltage E¢ is called the voltage behind the transient
reactance and is assumed to be equal to the initial value of the induced voltage, at
the start of the transient. The stator resistance is Rs. The dynamic analysis problem
consists of selecting a sufficiently simple but reasonably realistic representation that
will not unduly complicate the dynamic analysis, particularly through the introduction
of nonlinearities.

It should be remarked that the basic equations of the induction machine, as
derived from first principles, are quite nonlinear. Thus, an accurate dynamic analysis
of the induction motor, without any linearizing approximations, requires the use of
computer simulation.

AC Motor Speed and Torque Control

As explained in an earlier section, AC machines are constrained to fixed-speed or
near fixed-speed operation when supplied by a constant-frequency source. Several

Part III Electromechanics

simple methods exist to provide limited speed control in AC induction machines;
more complex methods, involving the use of advanced power electronics circuits, can
be used if the intended application requires wide-bandwidth control of motor speed
or torque. In this subsection we provide a general overview of available solutions.

Pole Number Control

The (conceptually) easiest method to implement speed control in an induction
machine is by varying the number of poles. Equation 14.55 explains the dependence
of synchronous speed in an AC machine on the supply frequency and on the number
of poles. For machines operated at 60 Hz, the following speeds can be achieved by
varying the number of magnetic poles in the stator winding:

2
3,600

4 6
1,800 | 1,200

8 12
800 | 600

Number of poles
n, t/min

Motor stators can be wound so that the number of pole pairs in the stators can be
varied by switching between possible winding connections. Such switching requires
that care be taken in timing it to avoid damage to the machine.

Slip Control

Since the rotor speed is inherently dependent on the slip, slip control is a valid means
of achieving some speed variation in an induction machine. Since motor torque falls
with the square of the voltage (see equation 14.82), it is possible to change the slip
by changing the motor torque through a reduction in motor voltage. This procedure
allows for speed control over the range of speeds that allow for stable motor operation.
With reference to Figure 14.42, this is possible only above point c, that is, above the
breakdown torque.

Rotor Control

For motors with wound rotors, it is possible to connect the rotor slip rings to
resistors; adding resistance to the rotor increases the losses in the rotor and therefore
causes the rotor speed to decrease. This method is also limited to operation above
the breakdown torque, although it should be noted that the shape of the motor
torque—speed characteristic changes when the rotor resistance is changed.

Frequency Regulation

The last two methods cause additional losses to be introduced in the machine. If
a variable-frequency supply is used, motor speed can be controlled without any
additional losses. As seen in equation 14.55, the motor speed is directly dependent on
the supply frequency, as the supply frequency determines the speed of the rotating
magnetic field. However, to maintain the same motor torque characteristics over a
range of speeds, the motor voltage must change with frequency, to maintain a constant
torque. Thus, generally, the volts/hertz ratio should be held constant. This condition
is difficult to achieve at start-up and at very low frequencies, in which cases the
voltage must be raised above the constant volts/hertz ratio that will be appropriate
at higher frequency.

Adjustable-Frequency Drives

The advances made in the last two decades in power electronics and microcontrollers
have made AC machines employing adjustable-frequency drives well suited to
many common engineering applications that until recently required the use of the
more easily speed-controlled DC drives. An adjustable-frequency drive consists of
four major subsystems, as shown in Figure 14.45.

Figure 14.45 General configuration of adjustable-frequency drive

The diagram of Figure 14.45 assumes that a three-phase AC supply is available;
the three-phase AC voltage is rectified using a controlled or uncontrolled rectifier
(see Chapter 9 for a description of uncontrolled rectifiers). An intermediate circuit
is sometimes necessary to further condition the rectified voltage and current. An
inverter is then used to convert the fixed DC voltage to a variable frequency
and variable-amplitude AC voltage. This is accomplished via pulse-amplitude
modulation (PAM) or increasingly via pulse-width modulation (PWM) techniques.
Figure 14.46 illustrates how approximately sinusoidal currents and voltages of variable
frequency can be obtained by suitable shaping of a train of pulses.

Conclusion

This chapter introduces the most common classes of rotating electric machines. These
machines, which can range in power from the milliwatt to the megawatt range, find common
application in virtually every field of engineering, from consumer products to heavy-duty

industrial applications. The principles introduced in this chapter can give you a solid basis
from which to build upon.

Upon completing this chapter, you should have mastered the following learning

objectives:

1.

Understand the basic principles of operation of rotating electric machines, their
classification, and basic efficiency and performance characteristics. Electric machines
are defined in terms of their mechanical characteristics (torque—speed curves, inertia,
friction and windage losses) and their electrical characteristics (current and voltage
requirements). Losses and efficiency are an important part of the operation of electric
machines, and it should be recognized that machines will suffer from electrical,
mechanical, and magnetic core losses. All machines are based on the principle of
establishing a magnetic field in the stationary part of the machine (stator) and a
magnetic field in the moving part of the machine (rotor); electric machines can then be
classified according to how the stator and rotor fields are established.

Understand the operation and basic configurations of separately excited,
permanent-magnet, shunt and series DC machines. Direct-current machines, operated
from a DC supply, are among the most common electric machines. The rotor (armature)
circuit is connected to an external DC supply via a commutator. The stator electric field
can be established by an external circuit (separately excited machines), by a permanent
magnet (PM machines), or by the same supply used for the armature (self-excited
machines).

Analyze DC generators at steady state. DC generators can be used to supply a variable
direct current and voltage when propelled by a prime mover (engine, or other thermal
or hydraulic machine).

Analyze DC motors under steady-state and dynamic operation. DC motors are
commonly used in a variety of variable-speed applications (e.g., electric vehicles,
servos) which require speed control; thus, their dynamics are also of

interest.

Understand the operation and basic configuration of AC machines, including the
synchronous motor and generator and the induction machine. AC machines require an
alternating-current supply. The two principal classes of AC machines are the
synchronous and induction types. Synchronous machines rotate at a predetermined
speed, which is equal to the speed of a rotating magnetic field present in the stator,
called the synchronous speed. Induction machines also operate based on a rotating
magnetic field in the stator; however, the speed of the rotor is dependent on the
operating conditions of the machine and is always less than the synchronous speed.
Variable-speed AC machines require more sophisticated electric power supplies that
can provide variable voltage/current and variable frequency. As the cost of power
electronics is steadily decreasing, variable-speed AC drives are becoming increasingly
common.

20 V. It delivers its rated voltamperes at a power
factor of 0.85. The resistance per phase is 0.05 (2, and
the field takes 2 A at 12 V. If the friction and windage

LINEAR ALGEBRA AND
COMPLEX NUMBERS

A.1. SOLVING SIMULTANEOUS LINEAR
EQUATIONS, CRAMER’S RULE,
AND MATRIX EQUATION

The solution of simultaneous equations, such as those that are often seen in circuit theory, may
be obtained relatively easily by using Cramer’s rule. This method applies to 2 x 2 or larger
systems of equations. Cramer’s rule requires the use of the concept of determinant. Linear, or
matrix, algebra is valuable because it is systematic, general, and useful in solving complicated
problems. A determinant is a scalar defined on a square array of numbers, or matrix, such as

det(A) =A} = |“" “? (A.1)

a2; an2

In this case the matrix is a 2 x 2 array with two rows and two columns, and its determinant is
defined as

det = a12. — 4124p, (A.2)

709

710

Appendix A Linear Algebra and Complex Numbers

A third-order, or 3 x 3, determinant such as
ay, 412) A43
det(A) = Jaz) a2 a3 (A.3)
a3, 432, 33
is given by

det = ay; (422433 — 423432) — G12 (421433 — 423031)

(A.4)
+ 413 (421432 — A22031)

For higher-order determinants, you may refer to a linear algebra book. To illustrate
Cramer’s method, a set of two equations in general form will be solved here. A set of two linear
simultaneous algebraic equations in two unknowns can be written in the form

aX + ay2X2 = by

(A.5)

Ay1X1 + Ay72X2 = bo

where x, and x, are the two unknowns. The coefficients a),, dj2, do,, and do. are known
quantities. The two quantities on the right-hand sides, b; and b2, are also known (these are
typically the source currents and voltages in a circuit problem). The set of equations can be
arranged in matrix form, as shown in equation A.6.

ayn ay} | x b
_ (A.6)
a2, Az. | | X2 by

In equation A.6, a coefficient matrix multiplied by a vector of unknown variables is equated to a
right-hand-side vector. Cramer’s rule can then be applied to find x; and x2, using the following
formulas:

by ay ay by
by ax ay by
xy, = ———— xX» = ———— (A.7)
ay a2 a1 ay2
a2, an? a2, an

Thus, the solution is given by the ratio of two determinants: the denominator is the determinant
of the matrix of coefficients, while the numerator is the determinant of the same matrix with the

b
right-hand-side vector ( in this case) substituted in place of the column of the coefficient
2

matrix corresponding to the desired variable (i.e., first column for x;, second column for x2, etc.).
In acircuit analysis problem, the coefficient matrix is formed by the resistance (or conductance)
values, the vector of unknowns is composed of the mesh currents (or node voltages), and the
right-hand-side vector contains the source currents or voltages.

In practice, many calculations involve solving higher-order systems of linear equations.
Therefore, a variety of computer software packages are often used to solve higher-order systems
of linear equations.

A.2 INTRODUCTION TO COMPLEX ALGEBRA
5

From your earliest training in arithmetic, you have dealt with real numbers such as 4, —2, 5:
zt, e, and so on, which may be used to measure distances in one direction or another from a
fixed point. However, a number that satisfies the equation

r+9=0 (A.8)

is not a real number. Imaginary numbers were introduced to solve equations such as equation
A.8. Imaginary numbers add a new dimension to our number system. To deal with imaginary
numbers, a new element, j, is added to the number system having the property

pal

or (A.9)

j=vul

Thus, we have j*> = —j, jt = 1,7? =j, and so on. Using equation A.9, you can see that the
solutions to equation A.8 are + j3. In mathematics, the symbol / is used for the imaginary unit,
but this might be confused with current in electrical engineering. Therefore, the symbol j is
used in this book.

A complex number (indicated in boldface notation) is an expression of the form

A=a+jb (A.10)

where a and b are real numbers. The complex number A has a real part a and an imaginary
part b, which can be expressed as

a=ReA

b=ImA (A.11)

It is important to note that a and b are both real numbers. The complex number a + jb can be
represented on a rectangular coordinate plane, called the complex plane, by interpreting it as
a point (a, b). That is, the horizontal coordinate is a in real axis, and the vertical coordinate
is b in imaginary axis, as shown in Figure A.1. The complex number A = a + jb can also be

712 Appendix A Linear Algebra and Complex Numbers

uniquely located in the complex plane by specifying the distance r along a straight line from
the origin and the angle 6, which this line makes with the real axis, as shown in Figure A.1.
From the right triangle of Figure A.1, we can see that

r=Vae4+bP

“()
6 = tan =
a (A.12)
a=rcos@
b=rsin0

Then we can represent a complex number by the expression
Az=re” =rZ0 (A.13)

which is called the polar form of the complex number. The number r is called the magnitude (or
amplitude), and the number 6 is called the angle (or argument). The two numbers are usually
denoted by r = |A| and 6 = argA= ZA.

Given a complex number A = a + jb, the complex conjugate of A, denoted by the
symbol A’, is defined by the following equalities:

ReA* = ReA

(A.14)
Im A* = —ImA

That is, the sign of the imaginary part is reversed in the complex conjugate.

Finally, we should remark that two complex numbers are equal if and only if the real
parts are equal and the imaginary parts are equal. This is equivalent to stating that two complex
numbers are equal only if their magnitudes are equal and their arguments are equal.

The following examples and exercises should help clarify these explanations.

EXAMPLE A.1

Convert the complex number A = 3 + /4 to its polar form.

Solution:
4
r=V32?4+0=5 6 = tan! (5) = 53.13°

A = 5253.13°

EXAMPLE A.2

Convert the number A = 47(—60°) to its complex form.

Solution:
a = 4cos(—60°) = 4cos(60°) = 2
b = 4sin(—60°) = —4 sin(60°) = —2V3

Thus, A = 2 — j2/3


Appendix A Linear Algebra and Complex Numbers

Addition and subtraction of complex numbers take place according to the following
rules:
(a; + joi) + (a2 + jb2) = (ay + a) + j(bi + br)

(a, + jb1) — (@ + jb2) = (a1 — a2) + j(b1 — br)

Multiplication of complex numbers in polar form follows the law of exponents. That is,
the magnitude of the product is the product of the individual magnitudes, and the angle of the
product is the sum of the individual angles, as shown below.

(A)(B) = (Ae?’)(Be/*) = ABeJ°*+*) = ABZ(0 + ) (A.16)

If the numbers are given in rectangular form and the product is desired in rectangular form,
it may be more convenient to perform the multiplication directly, using the rule that j> = —1,
as illustrated in equation A.17.

(a; + jb) (ay + fbx) = ayay + jayby + jarby + Pdi bo
= (aydy + jb by) + j(ayby + anh) (A.17)
= (ad — by bz) + j(aybz + ab)

Division of complex numbers in polar form follows the law of exponents. That is, the
magnitude of the quotient is the quotient of the magnitudes, and the angle of the quotient is the
difference of the angles, as shown in equation A.18.

A Ae” AZO A 40 AAS

B Be® ~ BZp ~ BX‘ 9) (A.18)
Division in the rectangular form can be accomplished by multiplying the numerator and
denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. Multiplying the denominator by its
complex conjugate converts the denominator to a real number and simplifies division. This is
shown in Example A.4. Powers and roots of a complex number in polar form follow the laws
of exponents, as shown in equations A.19 and A.20.

Solution:
A+B=(24+5)+j[3+(-4] =7-j
A-B= (2-5) +j[3 — (-4)] = -3 +j7

For part (c), 2A = 44+ j6 and 3B = 15 — j12. Thus, 2A + 3B = (44+ 15) +
J[6 + (—12)] = 19 — j6

EXAMPLE A.4

Perform the following operations in both rectangular and polar form, given that A = 3 + j3

To obtain the answer in polar form, we need to convert A and B to their polar forms:
A= 3V 20/4 = 3./2245°
B= V4e! = 2260°
Then
AB = (3V2e!*")(W/4e") = 6V22105°
(b) To find A + B in rectangular form, we can multiply A and B by B*.

Euler’s Identity

This formula extends the usual definition of the exponential function to allow for complex
numbers as arguments. Euler’s identity states that

e”” =cos@ +jsin@ (A.21)

All the standard trigonometry formulas in the complex plane are direct consequences of Euler’s
identity. The two important formulas are

THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

B.1 COMPLEX FREQUENCY
AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

The transient analysis methods illustrated in Chapter 5 for first- and second-order circuits
can become rather cumbersome when applied to higher-order circuits. Moreover, solving the
differential equations directly does not reveal the strong connection that exists between the
transient response and the frequency response of a circuit. The aim of this section is to
introduce an alternate solution method based on the notions of complex frequency and of
the Laplace transform. The concepts presented will demonstrate that the frequency response
of linear circuits is but a special case of the general transient response of the circuit, when
analyzed by means of Laplace methods. In addition, the use of the Laplace transform method
allows the introduction of systems concepts, such as poles, zeros, and transfer functions, that
cannot be otherwise recognized.

Complex Frequency
In Chapter 4, we considered circuits with sinusoidal excitations such as

v(t) = Acos(wt + @) (B.1)

which we also wrote in the equivalent phasor form

V( jo) = Ae? = AZO (B.2)
The two expressions just given are related by

v(t) = Re(Ve/“’) (B.3)

As was shown in Chapter 4, phasor notation is extremely useful in solving AC steady-state
circuits, in which the voltages and currents are steady-state sinusoids. We now consider a
different class of waveforms, useful in the transient analysis of circuits, namely, damped
sinusoids. The most general form of a damped sinusoid is

v(t) = Ae” cos(wt + @) (B.4)

As one can see, a damped sinusoid is a sinusoid multiplied by a real exponential e°’. The
constant o is real and is usually zero or negative in most practical circuits. Figure B.1(a) and
(b) depicts the case of a damped sinusoid with negative o and with positive o, respectively.
Note that the case of o = 0 corresponds exactly to a sinusoidal waveform. The definition of
phasor voltages and currents given in Chapter 4 can easily be extended to account for the case
of damped sinusoidal waveforms by defining a new variable s, called the complex frequency:

s=ot+jo (B.5)

Note that the special case of o = 0 corresponds to s = jw, that is, the familiar steady-state
sinusoidal (phasor) case. We shall now refer to the complex variable V(s) as the complex
frequency domain representation of v(t). It should be observed that from the viewpoint of
circuit analysis, the use of the Laplace transform is analogous to phasor analysis; that is,
substituting the variable s wherever jw was used is the only step required to describe a circuit
using the new notation.

All the concepts and rules used in AC network analysis (see Chapter 4), such as imped-
ance, admittance, KVL, KCL, and Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems, carry over to the damped
sinusoid case exactly. In the complex frequency domain, the current I(s) and voltage V(s) are
related by the expression

V(s) = Z(s)I(s) (B.6)

where Z(s) is the familiar impedance, with s replacing jw. We may obtain Z(s) from Z(j@) by
simply replacing jw by s. For a resistance R, the impedance is

Zr(s) =R (B.7)
For an inductance L, the impedance is
Z(s) = sL (B.8)

For a capacitance C, it is

1
Zc(8) = ai (B.9)

Impedances in series or parallel are combined in exactly the same way as in the AC steady-state
case, since we only replace jw by s.

Finally, the time-domain expression for the current is

Comments: The phasor analysis method illustrated here is completely analogous to the method

introduced in Chapter 4, with the complex frequency jw (steady-state sinusoidal frequency)
related by s (damped sinusoidal frequency).

Just as frequency response functions H (jw) were defined in this appendix, it is possible
to define a transfer function H(s). This can be a ratio of a voltage to a current, a ratio of
a voltage to a voltage, a ratio of a current to a current, or a ratio of a current to a voltage.
The transfer function H (s) is a function of network elements and their interconnections. Using
the transfer function and knowing the input (voltage or current) to a circuit, we can find an
expression for the output either in the complex frequency domain or in the time domain. As an
example, suppose V;(s) and V,(s) are the input and output voltages to a circuit, respectively,
in complex frequency notation. Then

from which we can obtain the output in the complex frequency domain by computing

method illustrated earlier in this section.

or unilateral Laplace transform, since f(t) is evaluated only for positive t. To conveniently
express arbitrary functions only for positive time, we introduce a special function called the

From what has been said so far about the Laplace transform, it is obvious that we may
compile a lengthy table of functions and their Laplace transforms by repeated application of
equation B.12 for various functions of time f (t). Then we could obtain a wide variety of inverse
transforms by matching entries in the table. Table B.1 lists some of the more common Laplace
transform pairs. The computation of the inverse Laplace transform is in general rather
complex if one wishes to consider arbitrary functions of s. In many practical cases, however,
it is possible to use combinations of known transform pairs to obtain the desired result.

Transfer Functions, Poles, and Zeros

It should be clear that the Laplace transform can be quite a convenient tool for analyzing
the transient response of a circuit. The Laplace variable s is an extension of the steady-state
frequency response variable jw already encountered in this appendix. Thus, it is possible to
describe the input-output behavior of a circuit by using Laplace transform ideas in the same
way in which we used frequency response ideas earlier. Now we can define voltages and
currents in the complex frequency domain as V(s) and I(s), and we denote impedances by
the notation Z(s), where s replaces the familiar jw. We define an extension of the frequency
response of a circuit, called the transfer function, as the ratio of any input variable to any output
variable, that is,

Vo I,

(s) or Hy(s) = (s)
Vi(s) Vi(s)

Asan example, consider the circuit of Figure B.2. We can analyze it by using a method analogous

to phasor analysis by defining impedances

Ay(s) = etc. (B.14)

Then we can use mesh analysis methods to determine that

or, upon simplifying and substituting the relationships of equation B.15,
L(s) 1

If we were interested in the relationship between the input voltages and, say, the capacitor
voltage, we could similarly calculate

H,(s) =< she R (B.18)

Aiy(s) =

(B.17)

Note that a transfer function consists of a ratio of polynomials; this ratio can also be expressed
in factored form, leading to the discovery of additional important properties of the circuit. Let
us, for the sake of simplicity, choose numerical values for the components of the circuit of
Figure B.2. For example, let R; = 0.5 Q,C = ; F, L = 0.5 H, and R, = 2 Q. Then we can
substitute these values into equation B.18 to obtain

0.55 +2 s+4
Ay(s) = = B.19
0) = 0060552 40.3755 42.5 (= + 65+ a) (B.19)
Equation B.19 can be factored into products of first-order terms as follows:
s+4
Ay(s) =8 B.20
6) E — 3.0000 + j5.5678)(s — 3.0000 =e | ( )

where it is apparent that the response of the circuit has very special characteristics for three
values of s: s = —4; s = +3.0000 + 75.5678; and s = +3.0000 — 5.5678. In the first case, at
the complex frequency s = —4, the numerator of the transfer function becomes zero, and the
response of the circuit is zero, regardless of how large the input voltage is. We call this particular
value of s a zero of the transfer function. In the latter two cases, for s = +3.0000 + j5.5678,
the response of the circuit becomes infinite, and we refer to these values of s as poles of the
transfer function.

It is customary to represent the response of electric circuits in terms of poles and zeros,
since knowledge of the location of these poles and zeros is equivalent to knowing the transfer
function and provides complete information regarding the response of the circuit. Further, if the
poles and zeros of the transfer function of a circuit are plotted in the complex plane, it is possible
to visualize the response of the circuit very effectively. Figure B.3 depicts the pole—zero plot
of the circuit of Figure B.2; in plots of this type it is customary to denote zeros by a small circle
and poles by an “x.”

726 Appendix B The Laplace Transform

The poles of a transfer function have a special significance, in that they are equal to the
roots of the natural response of the system. They are also called the natural frequencies of
the circuit. Example B.6 illustrates this point.

Now, let us determine the transfer function of the circuit, say, V.(s)/VWs(s). Applying the

The denominator of this function, which determines the poles of the circuit, is identical to the
characteristic equation of the circuit: The poles of the transfer function are identical to the roots
of the characteristic equation!

Comments: Describing a circuit by means of its transfer function is completely equivalent to
representing it by means of its differential equation. However, it is often much easier to derive
a transfer function by basic circuit analysis than it is to obtain the differential equation of a
circuit.

The circuit is a parallel resonant circuit and should exhibit maxima of impedance and minima of impedance at low and
high frequencies.
1. At the resonant frequency, the impedance is real; that is, the reactive part is zero. Set f|(@,) = fo(@,) and solve for
Oy.
2. The magnitude of the impedance at the resonant frequency is Z, evaluated at the resonant frequency:
Z, = R./(1 — wLC)
3. The three cutoff (3-dB) frequencies are evaluated by making the functions of frequency equal to +1 or —1.
Si (@-) =l1=> 0.33 f2(@) =1tl=> Mel and ®o2.
4. The magnitude of the impedance when the frequency is low can be determined in two ways. First, the circuit can
be modeled at low frequencies by replacing the inductor with a short circuit and the capacitor with an open circuit.
Under these conditions the impedance is equal to that of the resistor. Or the limit of the impedance as the
frequency approaches zero can be determined. Z, = lim, .9 Z(jw) = R..

The device is called a modulo-16 ripple counter. It can count clock pulses from 0 to 24 — 1. The outputs divide the
frequency by 2', 2?, 2°, and 2*, respectively. Therefore, you can use this circuit as a divide-by-N counter, where N

is 2, 4, 8, and 16.

The basic operation of the circuit is to count up when X = 0, and to count down when X = 1.

About the Cover

The cover of the fifth edition of Rizzoni’s Principles and Applications of
Electrical Engineering features the Ohio State University Buckeye Bullet.
Students from a variety of engineering disciplines, working with Professor
Rizzoni through the university’s Center for Automotive Research, designed
and built this electric powered streamliner for the purpose of establishing new
land speed records for electric vehicles. In October 2004, the Buckeye Bullet
set a new U.S. land speed record at 314.958 mph and a new International
land speed record at 271.737 mph, becoming the fastest self-powered electric
vehicle in history. The Buckeye Bullet is 30 feet long, and is powered by a
variable-speed AC induction drive supplied by a 1,000-V NiMH battery pack.

OUR COMMITMENT TO ACCURACY

You have a right to expect an accurate textbook, and McGraw-Hill Engineering invests
considerable time and effort to ensure that we deliver one. Listed below are the many
steps we take in this process.

OUR ACCURACY VERIFICATION PROCESS
| First Round

Step 1: Numerous college engineering instructors review the manuscript and report
errors to the editorial team. The authors review their comments and make the necessary
corrections in their manuscript.

Second Round
Step 2: An expert in the field works through every example and exercise in the final
manuscript to verify the accuracy of the examples, exercises, and solutions. The authors
review any resulting corrections and incorporate them into the final manuscript and solu-
tions manual.

Step 3: The manuscript goes to a copyeditor, who reviews the pages for grammatical and
stylistic considerations. At the same time, the expert in the field begins a second accuracy
check. All corrections are submitted simultaneously to the authors, who review and inte-
grate the editing, and then submit the manuscript pages for typesetting.

Third Round
Step 4: The authors review their page proofs for a dual purpose: 1) to make certain that
any previous corrections were properly made, and 2) to look for any errors they might
have missed.

Step 5: A proofreader is assigned to the project to examine the new page proofs, double
check the authors’ work, and add a fresh, critical eye to the book. Revisions are incorpo-

Electrical Engineering

The tradition of quality and excellence continues...

Today's engineers must be able to communicate effectively within the interdisciplinary teams in " haba tt
nye which they work. Electrical, electronic and electromechanical systems are pervasive in all aspects of i
4 ii FE engineering design and analysis. Rizzoni’s Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering serves to prepare
i | students for their careers following these basic objectives:

t

s ; e To present the fundamentals of electrical and electronic circuits, and of electronic and
i } t electromechanical systems using an approach that is designed to appeal to students from
a variety of engineering disciplines through applied examples and effective pedagogy.
© To introduce students to the most appropriate analytical and computational tools to solve
a variety of practical problems.
° To illustrate by way of concrete, fully developed examples, many relevant applications of the
fundamentals of electrical engineering.

The First Edition of Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering provides a comprehensive approach to
help instructors and students explore the fundamental topics that provide the foundations of
electrical engineering. This text focuses on the fundamental topics that form the content of most
introductory EE courses. The hallmark feature of extensive use of practical, interesting applications
’ from all areas of engineering to illustrate fundamental issues can be found in Fundamentals of
Electrical Engineering, as well as in Principles and Applications of Electrical Engineering, also by
Giorgio Rizzoni.

Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering is the ideal choice for introductory electrical engineering
courses with a mixed audience: it combines appropriate rigor with a wealth of basic, intermediate,
and advanced examples. It uses excellent pedagogy in reinforcing basic concept and solution
methods, and will serve the students as a useful reference throughout their engineering careers.

Understanding the challenge of teaching a course with, in some cases, both faculty and students
from different fields within engineering, McGraw-Hill provides instructor and student resources
for this text.
