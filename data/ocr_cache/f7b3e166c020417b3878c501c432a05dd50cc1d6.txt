Study skills are approaches applied to learning which could be any skill that boosts a
person's ability to study and pass exams. They could include time management and
motivational techniques.

Methods of study skills

= Methods based on memorization

= Methods based on communication skills e.g. reading and listening

= Methods based on signals

= Methods based on condensing information, summarizing and the use of keywords
= Methods based on visual imagery

= Methods based on acronyms and mnemonics

= Methods based on time management, organization and lifestyle changes

Methods based on memorization e.g. rehearsal and cram learning

One of the most basic approaches to learning any information is simply to repeat it by
cramming. Typically this will include reading over notes or textbook and re-writing
notes.

Methods based on communication skills e.g. reading and listening

The weakness with note learning is that it implies a passive reading or listening style.
Educators such as John Dewey have argued that students need to learn critical thinking -
questioning and weighing up evidence as they learn. This can be done during lectures or
when reading books. There are a variety of studies from different colleges world-wide
that show peer-communication can help increase better study habits tremendously.

Methods based on signals e.g. flashcard training

Flash Cards are visual signals on cards. These have numerous uses in teaching and
learning, but can be used for revision. Students often make their own flash cards, or more
detailed index cards - cards designed for filing, often A5 size, on which short summaries
are written.

Methods based on condensing information, summarizing and the use of keywords

Summary methods vary depending on the topic, but most involve condensing the large
amount of information from a course or book into shorter notes. Often these notes are
then condensed further into key facts.

Methods based on visual imagery

Some learners are thought to have a visual learning style, and will benefit greatly from
taking information from their studies which is often heavily verbal and using visual
techniques to help simplify and retain it in memory. Some memory techniques make use
of visual memory, for example a system of visualizing key information in real physical
locations e.g. around a room.

Methods based on acronyms and mnemonics

A mnemonic is a method of organizing and memorizing information. Some use a simple
phrase or fact as a trigger for a longer list of information. For example, the points of the
compass can be recalled in the correct order with the phrase "Never Eat Shredded
Wheat". Starting with North, the first letter of each word relates to a compass point in
clockwise order round a compass.

Methods based on time management, organization and lifestyle changes

Often, improvements to the effectiveness of study may be achieved through changes to
things unrelated to the study material itself, such as time-management, boosting
motivation and avoiding procrastination, and in improvements to sleep and diet.Time
management in study sessions aims to ensure that activities that achieve the greatest
benefit are given the greatest focus. A traffic lights system is a simple way of identifying
the importance of information, highlighting or underlining information in colours:

= Green: topics to be studied first; important and also simple
= Yellow: topics to be studied next; important but time-consuming
= Red: lowest priority; complex and not vital.

This reminds students to start with the things which will provide the quickest benefit,
while 'red' topics are only dealt with if time allows.

Study Skills to Accelerate Your Learning
Here are the 5 study skills that are found to be the most effective:
Study Skill 1: Elaborative interrogation (Asking ‘“‘Why’’)

A great way to learn is to ask yourself questions. Little kids know things intuitively, as
they run around asking “Why, why, why?” A great deal of research has proven that the
kids are on to something. Getting students to answer questions, such as “Why is this fact
true?” aids learning.

Study Skill 2: Self-Explanation

The idea behind self-explanation as a reading strategy is to pause from reading your
textbook periodically and explain to yourself what it means to you. You can do this after
a section of text, or when studying an example problem. When trying to self-explain, you
may find that you need to look back over parts of the text to fully understand what’s
being said.

Study Skill 3: Practice testing

The main idea behind practice testing is that testing yourself improveslearning. Tests are
not just for evaluation anymore. Testing improves learning by exercising memory
retrieval. When you answer a test question, you have to actively search your long-term
memory. Doing so creates more and better pathways to the answer. This makes the
answer easier to find the next time around. Practice testing is easy to do. You can make
flash cards or answer questions from your textbook.

Study Skill 4: Distributed Practice

You will really do better to space your studying out over the time you have. Do a little at
a time over several study sessions. That’s the idea behind distributed practice. One reason
distributed practice aids learning is that you have to re-start your memory for the topic
during each study session. Once your memory for the topic is warmed up and moving,
doing more is fairly easy.

Study Skill 5: Interleaved Practice

When studying subjects like math, you need to learn a few different kinds of formulas.
For example, you learn one equation to compute the area of a circle. You learn another to
figure out the perimeter. The idea behind interleaved practice is that you are better off
mixing some area problems with some perimeter problems when you study.

The reason this works is that you need to learn a bit more than/on how to apply each
formula. You also need to learn when to use one formula and when to use another. When
you see a new problem, you first have to figure out what kind of problem it is. By
interleaving the problems during your study sessions, you give yourself practice at telling
the problems apart.

Notes:

These five study skills all appear to work quite well. The study skills are far more
complementary than competing. In any case, they can readily work together.
