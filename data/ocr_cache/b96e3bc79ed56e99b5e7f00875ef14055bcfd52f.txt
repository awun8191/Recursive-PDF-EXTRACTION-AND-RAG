Library Materials

Library materials or resources are all kinds of human intellectual product that contain
information in prints, non-prints and electronic forms which are carefully selected,
acquired, organized and made accessible to users for the effective running of the library.

Types of Library Materials

Library materials can be grouped into three, namely: print materials, non-print materials
and electronic resources.

Print materials: are those that have information printed on papers.

Print materials can be categorized into three (3), namely: books, reference materials and
serials.

1. Books (fiction and non-fiction) are set of printed pages that are fastened together
inside a cover which can be turned and read page by page. Books can be divided
into fiction and non-fiction.

i. Fiction books are story books based on imaginary characters and events,
and are not based on people and facts. They are books on imaginary ideas
or events.

ii. Non-fiction books: They contain information on subjects and disciplines.
Such as textbooks on various discipline i.e. writing that is about real
people, places, things and events.

2. Reference materials are specific kinds of publication that are planned and written
to be consulted for specific information. Examples are: encyclopaedia, dictionary,
directory, yearbook, biography, handbook, almanac, gazetteer, indexes and
abstract e.t.c.

Characteristics of reference materials

i. The materials are meant for consultation mainly in the library.
ii. The materials are very expensive.
iii. | The reference materials are not expected to be read from cover to cover.

Iv. They are housed separately within the library.
V. The arrangement in most cases is alphabetical while for historical works,
they are arranged chronologically based on time of occurrence.
vi. They are rare books that must be handled with care.
3. Serials are publications that are issued out at regular or irregular intervals which

are intended to be continued indefinitely. They are acquired through subscriptions;
they give first hand information and are more current than published books.
Examples are; journals, magazines, reports, newspapers, minutes of meeting
among others.

Non-print materials: these are information materials that are not in printed form. They
can be divided into three (3), namely:

i. Audio materials: These are library materials that can be appreciated through
the auditory senses, such as phonodiscs, radiotapes or audiotapes and audio
cassettes.

ii. Visual materials: These can only be appreciated through the visual senses,
such as maps, posters, photographs, charts, diagrams, microfiche, globes
e.t.c.

the auditory and visual senses such as, sound film, television, videotapes,
video cassettes and video discs.

Electronic resources: are the library resources that are being used electronically with the
aid of computers and other telecommunication system. Examples are CD-ROM, Internet,
OPACS, electronics books and electronic journals.

Reference Services

1. Current Awareness Service (CAS): this service makes available knowledge of
what is being done in specific fields of endeavour through documents (such as
notes, abstracts, clippings, email, Selective Dissemination of Information,
and Database records) or orally (such as face-to-face or telephone conversations).

Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI): SDI is a_ personal Current
Awareness Service. It refers to a technique for directing new items of
information, from whatever source, to those individuals whose current interests in
a particular subject are high, and who may be able to take advantage of such
information. It is based on a user interest profile. It is rendered to the user through
preferred medium which could be by emails, phone calls, fax, and social media.
This type of service is very common in special/ research libraries.

Library publication: It is usual for a library to issue out publication that will guide
users in the use of library facilities and resources e.g. library guide. This
publication provides detailed and accurate information about the library.

Translation services: This is a service rendered to users who need translation of
information materials in a language he or she desires other than the original
language in which the materials were written. It is important to provide readers
with the materials requested in the language that readers can comprehend.

Referral services: This is a service in which a reader might be directed to another
person, sections in library or other library as an alternative source of information.

Carrel services: It is when smaller rooms or cubicles that cannot take more than a
person are being provided in the library for researchers to keep them away from
distractions. It encourages independent study.
