Introduction

In the past lectures, we have learnt among other things what a library is; that there are
different types of libraries, which include the academic library, the special library, the
private library, the National library and the Public Library.

We learnt that whatever type of library we are referring to, it is a room or building or
institution where books and non-books (audio-visual) materials are carefully selected and
acquired for the purpose of study, research and recreation organized in such a way by
professionals and non-professionals so as to facilitate easy retrieval.

As the library materials are being organized by professionals and non-professionals to
facilitate easy retrieval, a record is being created which the users would consult to find
out whether the material they need is in the library, and if it is, how and where to locate
the material, and this record is called the Library Catalogue.

The Library Catalogue

The library catalogue is a register of all bibliographic items found in a particular library
or group of libraries. It is a comprehensive list of books, journals and non-book materials
in a library collection usually arranged by author / title or by subjects in alphabetical
order.

Forms of Catalogue
i. Card Catalogue
li. Book Catalogue
iii. Automated /On-line Catalogue (OPAC)

Card Catalogue: This is the most common type of catalogue found in the libraries, with
the entries for all materials in the library printed, typed or handwritten on cards (usually
size 5*3 inches) and filed in trays or drawers which are housed in the card drawers by
means of locking rods.

The following items of information are recorded in almost any type of catalogue: Author
of document, Title of document, Edition, Place of publication, Publisher and Year of
publication, Pagination, Series statement, Notes, ISBN, Binding and Price, and the
subject of the document. The card catalogue was a familiar sight to library users for
generations, but it is now being effectively replaced by the online public access catalogue
(OPAC).

Book Catalogue: In this catalogue, instead of each card having bibliographic information
of a book, several books can have their information on just one page of the book. This is
the oldest type of catalogue. It is used in small libraries.

Automated/On-line Catalogue: This is popularly known as Online Public Access
Catalogue (OPAC). It is the most recent form of catalogue. This is facilitated by the
present state of technology. This system allows the user to interact with the catalogue in
an on-line mode thereby accessing the library collection with the aid of a computer.

Objectives of Library Catalogue

The library catalogue serves as a guide to the book collection. This is a chief means of
discovering and locating materials in the library. Through the catalogues, one can know
whether the library has in its collections a particular book specified by its author and title,
subject and editor of a particular work.

Classification

Classification is simply the arrangement of books and non-book materials according to
the areas of knowledge. Since it is convenient and important that all books on a subject
be kept together, libraries have classification schemes as tools for achieving this goal.

There are many classification schemes; however, the most commonly used schemes are
the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and the Library of Congress (LC) classification
schemes.

Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) Scheme: The scheme divides the whole of human
knowledge into ten main classes which are represented by Arabic numerals sequentially
from 000-999 and each class is further sub-divided into divisions and sub-divisions. DDC
is used mainly by Research Libraries, Public Libraries, School Libraries and some others.

Library of Congress (LC) Classification Scheme: This classification scheme uses
letters of the alphabets combined with Arabic numerals. It groups the whole field of
knowledge into 21 main classes which are represented by capital letters A-Z singly used.

Main classes are represented by two capital letters while topics under the classes and
divisions are developed by the use of Arabic numerals sequentially from 1- 9999. LC is
used mainly in Academic Libraries such as University, Polytechnic and Colleges of
Education libraries.
