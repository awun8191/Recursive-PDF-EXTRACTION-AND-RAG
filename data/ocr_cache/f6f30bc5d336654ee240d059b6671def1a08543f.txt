Preface

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology Sth Edi-
tion provides coverage for a wide range of courses
that contain electrical principles, circuit theory and
technology in their syllabuses, from introductory to
degree level — and including Edexcel BTEC Levels 2
to 5 National Certificate/Diploma and Higher National
Certificate/Diploma in Engineering.

The text is set out in four parts as follows:

PART 1, involving Chapters 1 to 12, contains ‘Basic
Electrical Engineering Principles’ which any student
wishing to progress in electrical engineering would
need to know. An introduction to units, electrical
circuits, resistance variation, batteries and alternative
sources of energy, series and parallel circuits, capacitors
and capacitance, magnetic circuits, electromagnetism,
electromagnetic induction, electrical measuring instru-
ments and measurements, semiconductor diodes and
transistors are all included in this section.

PART 2, involving Chapters 13 to 22, contains ‘Electri-
cal Principles and Technology’ suitable for National
Certificate, National Diploma and City and Guilds
courses in electrical and electronic engineering. D.c.
circuit theory, alternating voltages and currents, single-
phase series and parallel circuits, d.c. transients, oper-
ational amplifiers, three-phase systems, transformers,
d.c. machines and three-phase induction motors are all
included in this section.

PART 3, involving Chapters 23 to 45, contains
‘Advanced Circuit Theory and Technology’ suit-
able for Degree, Foundation degree, Higher National
Certificate/Diploma and City and Guilds courses in
electrical and electronic/telecommunications engineer-
ing. The two earlier sections of the book will pro-
vide a valuable reference/revision for students at this
level.

Complex numbers and their application to series and
parallel networks, power in a.c. circuits, a.c. bridges,
series and parallel resonance and Q-factor, network
analysis involving Kirchhoff’s laws, mesh and nodal
analysis, the superposition theorem, Thévenin’s and
Norton’s theorems, delta—star and star—delta transforms,
maximum power transfer theorems and impedance

matching, complex waveforms, Fourier series, har-
monic analysis, magnetic materials, dielectrics and
dielectric loss, field theory, attenuators, filter networks,
magnetically coupled circuits, transmission line theory
and transients and Laplace transforms are all included
in this section.

PART 4 provides a short ‘General Reference’ for stan-
dard electrical quantities — their symbols and units, the
Greek alphabet, common prefixes and resistor colour
coding and ohmic values.

At the beginning of each of the 45 chapters a brief
explanation as to why it is important to understand the
material contained within that chapter, together with
learning objectives, is listed.

At the end of each of the first three parts of the text is a
handy reference of the main formulae used.

There are a number of internet downloads freely avail-
able to both students and lecturers/instructors; these are
listed on page xii.

It is not possible to acquire a thorough understanding
of electrical principles, circuit theory and technology
without working through a large number of numerical
problems. It is for this reason that Electrical Cir-
cuit Theory and Technology 5th Edition contains some
700 detailed worked problems, together with nearly
1000 further problems (with answers at the back of
the book), arranged within 177 Exercises that appear
every few pages throughout the text. Over 1100 line
diagrams further enhance the understanding of the
theory.

Fourteen Revision Tests have been included, inter-
spersed within the text every few chapters. For example,
Revision Test 1 tests understanding of Chapters | to
4, Revision Test 2 tests understanding of Chapters 5
to 7, Revision Test 3 tests understanding of Chapters
8 to 12, and so on. These Revision Tests do not have
answers given since it is envisaged that lecturers/instruc-
tors could set the Revision Tests for students to attempt
as part of their course structure. Lecturers/instructors
may obtain acomplimentary set of solutions of the Revi-
sion Tests in an Instructor’s Manual available from the
publishers via the internet — see below.

Units associated with basic
electrical quantities

Why it is important to understand: Units associated with basic electrical quantities

The relationship between quantities can be written using words or symbols (letters), but symbols are
normally used because they are much shorter; for example, V is used for voltage, J for current and R for
resistance. Some of the units have a convenient size for electronics, but most are either too large or too small
to be used directly so they are used with prefixes. The prefixes make the unit larger or smaller by the value
shown; for example, 25 mA is read as 25 milliamperes and means 25 x 10-3A = 25 x 0.001A = 0.025A.
Knowledge of this chapter is essential for future studies and provides the basis of electrical units and
prefixes; some simple calculations help understanding.

The system of units used in engineering and science is
the Systéme Internationale d’ Unités (international sys-
tem of units), usually abbreviated to SI units, and is
based on the metric system. This was introduced in 1960
and is now adopted by the majority of countries as the
official system of measurement.

The basic units in the SI system are listed with their
symbols in Table 1.1.

Derived SI units use combinations of basic units and
there are many of them. Two examples are:

e Velocity — metres per second (m/s)

e Acceleration — metres per second squared (m/s*)

SI units may be made larger or smaller by using prefixes
which denote multiplication or division by a particu-
lar amount. The six most common multiples, with their
meaning, are listed in Table 1.2. For a more complete
list of prefixes, see page 741.

1.2 Charge

The unit of charge is the coulomb* (C), where
one coulomb is one ampere second (1coulomb =
6.24 x 10!8 electrons). The coulomb is defined as the
quantity of electricity which flows past a given point
in an electric circuit when a current of one ampere’ is
maintained for one second. Thus,

charge,in coulombs Q=Ii

where / is the current in amperes and f¢ is the time in

The unit of force is the newton*(N) where one newton
is one kilogram metre per second squared. The newton
is defined as the force which, when applied to a mass of
one kilogram, gives it an acceleration of one metre per
second squared. Thus,

force, innewtons F=ma

where m is the mass in kilograms and a is the accelera-
tion in metres per second squared. Gravitational force,
or weight, is mg, where g =9.81 m/s’.

Problem 2. A mass of 5000 g is accelerated at
2m/s? by a force. Determine the force needed.

Force = mass x acceleration

downwards on a mass of 200 g attached to a wire.

The unit of work or energy is the joule*(J), where
one joule is one newton metre. The joule is defined as the

one joule per second. Power is defined as the rate of
doing work or transferring energy. Thus,

Problem 4. A portable machine requires a force
of 200 N to move it. How much work is done if the
machine is moved 20m and what average power is
utilized if the movement takes 25 s?

Work done = force x distance = 200N x 20m

= 4000 Nm or 4kJ

work done 4000J
time taken 255

Power = = 160J/s=160 W

Problem 5. A mass of 1000 kg is raised through a
height of 10m in 20s. What is (a) the work done
and (b) the power developed?

(a) Work done=force x distance
force = mass x acceleration
Hence, work done= (1000 kg x 9.81 m/s?) x (10m)
= 98 100 Nm
= 98.1kNm or 98.1kJ

work done _ 98 100J

1.6 Electrical potential and e.m.f.

The unit of electric potential is the volt (V), where one
volt is one joule per coulomb. One volt is defined as the
difference in potential between two points in a conductor
which, when carrying acurrent of one ampere, dissipates
a power of one watt, i.e.

watts joules/second
volts = =
amperes amperes
joules joules

ampere seconds coulombs

(The volt is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro
Volta.*)

A change in electric potential between two points in
an electric circuit is called a potential difference. The
electromotive force (e.m.f.) provided by a source of
energy such as a battery or a generator is measured in
volts.

1.7 Resistance and conductance

The unit of electric resistance is the ohm*(Q), where
one ohm is one volt per ampere. It is defined as the
resistance between two points in a conductor when a
constant electric potential of one volt applied at the two
points produces a current flow of one ampere in the
conductor. Thus,

. . 14
resistance inohms, R= 7
where V is the potential difference across the two points
in volts and J is the current flowing between the two
points in amperes.

The reciprocal of resistance is called conductance
and is measured in siemens (S), named after the German
inventor and industrialist Ernst Siemen.* Thus,

An introduction to
electric circuits

Electric circuits are a part of the basic fabric of modern technology. A circuit consists of electrical elements
connected together, and we can use symbols to draw circuits. Engineers use electrical circuits to solve
problems that are important in modern society, such as in the generation, transmission and consumption
of electrical power and energy. The outstanding characteristics of electricity compared with other power
sources are its mobility and flexibility. The elements in an electric circuit include sources of energy,
resistors, capacitors, inductors, and so on. Analysis of electric circuits means determining the unknown
quantities such as voltage, current and power associated with one or more elements in the circuit. Basic
electric circuit analysis and laws are explained in this chapter and knowledge of these are essential in the
solution of engineering problems.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

2.2 Electric current and quantity

of electricity

All atoms consist of protons, neutrons and electrons.
The protons, which have positive electrical charges,
and the neutrons, which have no electrical charge,
are contained within the nucleus. Removed from the

An introduction to electric circuits

nucleus are minute negatively charged particles called
electrons. Atoms of different materials differ from one
another by having different numbers of protons, neu-
trons and electrons. An equal number of protons and
electrons exist within an atom and it is said to be elec-
trically balanced, as the positive and negative charges
cancel each other out. When there are more than two
electrons in an atom the electrons are arranged into
shells at various distances from the nucleus.

All atoms are bound together by powerful forces of
attraction existing between the nucleus and its elec-
trons. Electrons in the outer shell of an atom, however,
are attracted to their nucleus less powerfully than are
electrons whose shells are nearer the nucleus.

It is possible for an atom to lose an electron; the
atom, which is now called an ion, is not now electri-
cally balanced, but is positively charged and is thus able
to attract an electron to itself from another atom. Elec-
trons that move from one atom to another are called free
electrons and such random motion can continue indef-
initely. However, if an electric pressure or voltage is
applied across any material there is a tendency for elec-
trons to move in a particular direction. This movement
of free electrons, known as drift, constitutes an electric
current flow. Thus current is the rate of movement of
charge.

Conductors are materials that contain electrons that are
loosely connected to the nucleus and can easily move
through the material from one atom to another.
Insulators are materials whose electrons are held firmly
to their nucleus.

The unit used to measure the quantity of electri-
cal charge Q is called the coulomb* C (where 1
coulomb =6.24 x 10!8 electrons).

If the drift of electrons in a conductor takes place at the
rate of one coulomb per second the resulting current is
said to be a current of one ampere.”

Thus, 1 ampere=1 coulomb per second or 1 A=1 C/s.

2. A current of 6A flows for 10 minutes. What
charge is transferred?

3. How long musta current of 100 mA flow so as
to transfer a charge of 80 C?

2.3 Potential difference and

resistance

For a continuous current to flow between two points in
a circuit a potential difference (p.d.) or voltage, V, is
required between them; a complete conducting path is
necessary to and from the source of electrical energy.
The unit of p.d. is the volt, V (named in honour of the
Italian physicist Alessandro Volta*).

Figure 2.2 shows a cell connected across a filament
lamp. Current flow, by convention, is considered as flow-
ing from the positive terminal of the cell, around the
circuit to the negative terminal.

The flow of electric current is subject to friction. This
friction, or opposition, is called resistance, R, and is the
property of a conductor that limits current. The unit of
resistance is the ohm;* | ohm is defined as the resistance
which will have a current of 1 ampere flowing through
it when 1 volt is connected across it, i.e.

potential difference

resistance R =
current

2.4 Basic electrical measuring

instruments

An ammeter is an instrument used to measure cur-
rent and must be connected in series with the circuit.
Figure 2.2 shows an ammeter connected in series with
the lamp to measure the current flowing through it. Since
all the current in the circuit passes through the ammeter
it must have a very low resistance.

A voltmeter is an instrument used to measure p.d. and
must be connected in parallel with the part of the cir-
cuit whose p.d. is required. In Figure 2.2, a voltmeter is
connected in parallel with the lamp to measure the p.d.
across it. To avoid a significant current flowing through
it a voltmeter must have a very high resistance.

An ohmmeter is an instrument for measuring
resistance.

A multimeter, or universal instrument, may be used to
measure voltage, current and resistance. An ‘Avometer’
and ‘fluke’ are typical examples.

The oscilloscope may be used to observe waveforms
and to measure voltages and currents. The display of
an oscilloscope involves a spot of light moving across

*Who was Volta? Go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

*Who was Ohm? Go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

An introduction to electric circuits 11

a screen. The amount by which the spot is deflected
from its initial position depends on the p.d. applied to
the terminals of the oscilloscope and the range selected.
The displacement is calibrated in ‘volts per cm’. For
example, if the spot is deflected 3 cm and the volts/em
switch is on 10 V/cm then the magnitude of the p.d. is
3cm x 10 V/cm, i.e. 30 V.

A wattmeter is an instrument for the measurement of
power in an electrical circuit.

A BMS80 or a 420 MIT megger or a bridge megger
may be used to measure both continuity and insula-
tion resistance. Continuity testing is the measurement
of the resistance of a cable to discover if the cable is
continuous, i.e. that it has no breaks or high-resistance
joints. Insulation resistance testing is the measurement
of resistance of the insulation between cables, individ-
ual cables to earth or metal plugs and sockets, and so on.
An insulation resistance in excess of 1 MQ is normally
acceptable.

A tachometer is an instrument that indicates the speed,
usually in revolutions per minute, at which an engine
shaft is rotating.

A stroboscope is a device for viewing a rotating object
at regularly recurring intervals, by means of either (a) a
rotating or vibrating shutter, or (b) a suitably designed
lamp which flashes periodically. If the period between
successive views is exactly the same as the time of
one revolution of the revolving object, and the dura-
tion of the view very short, the object will appear to be
stationary.

See Chapter 10 for more detail about electrical measur-
ing instruments and measurements.

2.5 Linear and non-linear devices

Figure 2.3 shows a circuit in which current J can be
varied by the variable resistor R2. For various settings
of Ro, the current flowing in resistor R1, displayed on
the ammeter, and the p.d. across Rj, displayed on the
voltmeter, are noted and a graph is plotted of p.d. against

Figure 2.3

p.d.

(a) (b)

Figure 2.4

current. The result is shown in Figure 2.4(a), where the
straight line graph passing through the origin indicates
that current is directly proportional to the p.d. Since
the gradient i.e. (p.d./current) is constant, resistance R1
is constant. A resistor is thus an example of a linear
device.

If the resistor R; in Figure 2.3 is replaced by a
component such as a lamp, then the graph shown in
Figure 2.4(b) results when values of p.d. are noted for
various current readings. Since the gradient is changing,
the lamp is an example of a non-linear device.

Ohm’s law” states that the current J flowing in a circuit
is directly proportional to the applied voltage V and
inversely proportional to the resistance R, provided the
temperature remains constant. Thus,

allows electric current to flow in it. All metals are con-
ductors and some examples include copper, aluminium,
brass, platinum, silver, gold and carbon.

which does not allow electric current to flow in it.
Some examples of insulators include plastic, rubber,
glass, porcelain, air, paper, cork, mica, ceramics and
certain oils.

Alternatively, since J =4 x 10-3 and R=5 x 10°,
then from Ohm’s law,

voltage V=IR=4x 107? x5x 1077=20V
Hence, power P=V x 1=20x4 x 1077 =80mW

Electrical energy

Electrical energy = power x time

If the power is measured in watts and the time in seconds
then the unit of energy is watt-seconds or joules.* If the
power is measured in kilowatts and the time in hours
then the unit of energy is kilowatt-hours, often called
the ‘unit of electricity’. The ‘electricity meter’ in the
home records the number of kilowatt-hours used and is
thus an energy meter.

Problem 14. A 12V battery is connected across a
load having a resistance of 40 Q. Determine the
current flowing in the load, the power consumed
and the energy dissipated in 2 minutes.

12
Current J = Vv =—=0.3A
R 40

Power consumed, P = VJ =(12)(0.3) =3.6 W

Energy dissipated

Problem 15. A source of e.m-f. of 15 V supplies a
current of 2 A for six minutes. How much energy is

Energy used per week

the element of an electric fire of resistance 20 Q
when a current of 10 A flows through it. If the fire is
on for 6 hours determine the energy used and the
cost if | unit of electricity costs 13 p.

Power P=I*R=10* x 20= 100 x 20=2000W
or 2kW (Alternatively, from Ohm’s law,
V=IR = 10x 20 = 200 V, hence
power P= V x I = 200 x 10 = 2000 W=2kW)
Energy used in 6 hours

= power x time

=2kW x 6h=12kWh
1 unit of electricity = 1 kWh

Hence the number of units used is 12
Cost of energy = 12 x 13 =£1.56

Problem 19. A business uses two 3 kW fires for
an average of 20 hours each per week, and six
150 W lights for 30 hours each per week. If the cost
of electricity is 14.25 p per unit, determine the
weekly cost of electricity to the business.

Energy = power x time
Energy used by one 3 kW fire in 20 hours

=3kW x 20h=60kWh

Hence weekly energy used by two 3 kW fires
=2 x 60=120kWh

Energy used by one 150 W light for 30 hours
=150W x 30h

= 4500 Wh=4.5kWh

Hence weekly energy used by six 150 W lamps
=6x4.5 =27kWh

Total energy used per week = 120+27=147kWh
1 unit of electricity = 1 kWh of energy

Thus weekly cost of energy at
14.25 p per kWh= 14.25 x 147=2094.75 p

= £20.95

2.10 Main effects of electric current

The three main effects of an electric current are:
(a) magnetic effect

(b) chemical effect

(c) heating effect.

Some practical applications of the effects of an electric
current include:

Magnetic effect: bells, relays, motors, generators,

transformers, telephones, car-ignition

and lifting magnets (see Chapter 8)

Chemical effect: primary and secondary cells and
electroplating (see Chapter 4)

Heating effect: — cookers, water heaters, electric fires,

irons, furnaces, kettles and

soldering irons

If there is a fault in a piece of equipment then excessive
current may flow. This will cause overheating and possi-
bly a fire; fuses protect against this happening. Current
from the supply to the equipment flows through the fuse.
The fuse is a piece of wire which can carry a stated cur-
rent; if the current rises above this value it will melt. If
the fuse melts (blows) then there is an open circuit and

no current can then flow — thus protecting the equipment
by isolating it from the power supply.

The fuse must be able to carry slightly more than the
normal operating current of the equipment to allow for
tolerances and small current surges. With some equip-
ment there is a very large surge of current for a short time
at switch on. If a fuse is fitted to withstand this large cur-
rent there would be no protection against faults which
cause the current to rise slightly above the normal value.
Therefore special anti-surge fuses are fitted. These can
stand 10 times the rated current for 10 milliseconds. If
the surge lasts longer than this the fuse will blow.

A circuit diagram symbol for a fuse is shown in
Figure 2.1 on page 9.

Resistance variation

An electron travelling through the wires and loads of an electric circuit encounters resistance. Resistance
is the hindrance to the flow of charge. The flow of charge through wires is often compared to the flow of
water through pipes. The resistance to the flow of charge in an electric circuit is analogous to the frictional
effects between water and the pipe surfaces as well as the resistance offered by obstacles that are present
in its path. It is this resistance that hinders the water flow and reduces both its flow rate and its drift speed.
Like the resistance to water flow, the total amount of resistance to charge flow within a wire of an electric
circuit is affected by some clearly identifiable variables. Factors which affect resistance are length, cross-
sectional area and type of material. The value of a resistor also changes with changing temperature, but
this is not as we might expect, mainly due to a change in the dimensions of the component as it expands
or contracts. It is due mainly to a change in the resistivity of the material caused by the changing activity
of the atoms that make up the resistor. Resistance variation due to length, cross-sectional area, type of
material and temperature variation are explained in this chapter, with calculations to aid understanding.
In addition, the resistor colour coding/ohmic values are explained.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

3.1 Resistor construction

There is a wide range of resistor types. Four of the most
common methods of construction are:

(i) Surface Mount Technology (SMT)

Many modern circuits use SMT resistors. Their manu-
facture involves depositing a film of resistive material
such as tin oxide on a tiny ceramic chip. The edges of the
resistor are then accurately ground or cut with a laser to
give a precise resistance across the ends of the device.
Tolerances may be as low as +0.02% and SMT resistors
normally have very low power dissipation. Their main
advantage is that very high component density can be
achieved.

(ii) Wire wound resistors

A length of wire such, as nichrome or manganin, whose
resistive value per unit length is known, is cut to the
desired value and wound around a ceramic former prior
to being lacquered for protection. This type of resistor
has a large physical size, which is a disadvantage; how-
ever, they can be made with a high degree of accuracy,
and can have a high power rating.

Wire wound resistors are used in power circuits and
motor starters.

(iii) Metal film resistors

Metal film resistors are made from small rods of
ceramic coated with metal, such as a nickel alloy. The
value of resistance is controlled firstly by the thickness
of the coating layer (the thicker the layer, the lower
the value of resistance), and secondly by cutting a fine
spiral groove along the rod using a laser or diamond
cutter to cut the metal coating into a long spiral strip,
which forms the resistor.

Metal film resistors are low tolerance, precise resis-
tors (£1% or less) and are used in electronic circuits.

(iv) Carbon film resistors

Carbon film resistors have a similar construction to
metal film resistors but generally with wider tolerance,
typically +5%. They are inexpensive, in common use,
and are used in electronic circuits.

3.2 Resistance and resistivity

The resistance of an electrical conductor depends on
four factors, these being: (a) the length of the conductor,
(b) the cross-sectional area of the conductor, (c) the type
of material and (d) the temperature of the material.

Resistance variation 19

Resistance, R, is directly proportional to length, /, of
aconductor, i.e. R xl. Thus, for example, if the length of
a piece of wire is doubled, then the resistance is doubled.

Resistance, R, is inversely proportional to cross-
sectional area, a, of a conductor, i.e. R« 1/a. Thus, for
example, if the cross-sectional area of a piece of wire is
doubled then the resistance is halved.

Since R«/ and R«l/a then R «l/a. By inserting a
constant of proportionality into this relationship the type
of material used may be taken into account. The con-
stant of proportionality is known as the resistivity of the
material and is given the symbol p (Greek rho). Thus,

. I
resistance R= a ohms
a

p is measured in ohm metres (Qm)

The value of the resistivity is that resistance of a unit
cube of the material measured between opposite faces
of the cube.

Resistivity varies with temperature and some typical
values of resistivities measured at about room tempera-
ture are given below:

Aluminium 2.6x 10-8 Qm (or 0.026 1Qm)

Glass 1x10!°Qm — (or 104 4Qm)

Note that good conductors of electricity have alow value
of resistivity and good insulators have a high value of
resistivity.

Problem 1. The resistance of a 5m length of wire
is 600 Q. Determine (a) the resistance of an 8m
length of the same wire, and (b) the length of the
same wire when the resistance is 420Q.

3.3 Temperature coefficient

of resistance

In general, as the temperature of a material increases,
most conductors increase in resistance, insulators
decrease in resistance, whilst the resistances of some
special alloys remain almost constant.

The temperature coefficient of resistance of a
material is the increase in the resistance of a 1Q

resistor of that material when it is subjected to a rise of
temperature of 1°C. The symbol used for the tempera-
ture coefficient of resistance is a (Greek alpha). Thus, if
some copper wire of resistance 1 Q is heated through
1°C and its resistance is then measured as 1.0043 Q
then a« =0.0043 Q/Q°C for copper. The units are usu-
ally expressed only as ‘per °C’, i.e. a=0.0043/°C
for copper. If the 1Q resistor of copper is heated
through 100°C then the resistance at 100°C would be
1+ 100 x 0.0043 = 1.43 Q.

Some typical values of temperature coefficient of resis-
tance measured at 0°C are given below:

Copper 0.0043/°C Aluminium  0.0038/°C
Nickel 0.0062/°C Carbon —0.000 48/°C
Constantan 0 Eureka 0.000 01/°C

(Note that the negative sign for carbon indicates that its
resistance falls with increase of temperature.)

If the resistance of a material at 0°C is known, the
resistance at any other temperature can be determined
from:

Ro = Ro(1 +000)

where Ro = resistance at 0°C
Ro = resistance at temperature 80°C
ao = temperature coefficient of resistance at 0°C.
Problem 8. A coil of copper wire has a resistance
of 100 when its temperature is O°C. Determine its

resistance at 70°C if the temperature coefficient of
resistance of copper at 0°C is 0.0043/°C.

Resistance Rg = Ro(1+ a0)

Hence resistance at 70°C, R79 = 100[1 + (0.0043) (70)]
= 100[1 + 0.301]
= 100(1.301)
= 130.12

Problem 9. An aluminium cable has a resistance
of 27 Q at a temperature of 35°C. Determine its
resistance at 0°C. Take the temperature coefficient
of resistance at 0°C to be 0.0038/°C.

Problem 10. A carbon resistor has a resistance of
1kQ at O°C. Determine its resistance at 80°C.
Assume that the temperature coefficient of
resistance for carbon at 0°C is —0.0005/°C.

Resistance at temperature 0°C, Ra = Ro(1 +408)

ie. Ro = 1000[1 + (—0.0005)(80)]
= 1000[1 — 0.040] = 1000(0.96)
= 9602

If the resistance of a material at room temperature
(approximately 20°C), Roo, and the temperature coef-
ficient of resistance at 20°C, a29, are known, then the
resistance Rg at temperature 6°C is given by:

Ro = R20[1 + a20(0 — 20)]

Problem 11. A coil of copper wire has a
resistance of 10 at 20°C. If the temperature
coefficient of resistance of copper at 20°C is
0.004/°C, determine the resistance of the coil when
the temperature rises to 100°C.

Resistance at 80°C, R= R2o9[1 +.a29(0 — 20)]
Hence resistance at 100°C,
Rioo = 10[1 + (0.004) (100 —20)]

= 10[1 + (0.004) (80)]

= 10[1+0.32]

= 10(1.32)

=13.22

Problem 12. The resistance of a coil of
aluminium wire at 18°C is 200 ©. The temperature
of the wire is increased and the resistance rises to
240 Q. If the temperature coefficient of resistance of
aluminium is 0.0039/°C at 18°C, determine the
temperature to which the coil has risen.

Let the temperature rise to 0°
Resistance at 06°C, Rg = Rig[1 +a 18 (8 — 18)]
ie. 240=200[1 + (0.0039) (6 — 18)]

240 = 200 + (200) (0.0039) (@ — 18)

240 — 200 =0.78(6 — 18)

40=0.78(6 — 18)
ee =0-18
51.28 =8@ — 18, from which,

8 =51.28+ 18=69.28°C

Hence the temperature of the coil increases to
69.28°C

If the resistance at O°C is not known, but is known at
some other temperature 6), then the resistance at any
temperature can be found as follows:

Ri = Ro(1 +404) and Rp = Ro(1 + a062)
Dividing one equation by the other gives:

Ri __ 1+a061
R, 1+ 0062

where R2=resistance at temperature 02

Problem 13. Some copper wire has a resistance
of 200 at 20°C. A current is passed through the
wire and the temperature rises to 90°C. Determine
the resistance of the wire at 90°C, correct to the
nearest ohm, assuming that the temperature
coefficient of resistance is 0.004/°C at 0°C.

Rx =200Q, ap =0.004/°C
Ro _ [1+a0(20)]
Roo [1 +.a0(90)]
Ro0[1 + 90a]
[1 +20ao]

i.e. the resistance of the wire at 90°C is 252 Q

3.4 Resistor colour coding and

ohmic values

(a) Colour code for fixed resistors

The colour code for fixed resistors is given in Table 3.1

Table 3.1

Colour Significant Multiplier Tolerance

(i) For a four-band fixed resistor (i.e. resistance
values with two significant figures):
yellow-violet-orange-red indicates 47kQ with a
tolerance of +2%

(Note that the first band is the one nearest the end
of the resistor.)

(ii) For a five-band fixed resistor (i.e. resistance
values with three significant figures): red-yellow-
white-orange-brown indicates 249 kQ with a toler-
ance of +1%

(Note that the fifth band is 1.5 to 2 times wider than
the other bands.)

Problem 14. Determine the value and tolerance
of a resistor having a colour coding of:
orange-orange-silver-brown.

The first two bands, i.e. orange-orange, give 33 from
Table 3.1.

The third band, silver, indicates a multiplier of 10? from
Table 3.1, which means that the value of the resistor is
33 x 10-7 =0.330


24 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

The fourth band, i.e. brown, indicates a tolerance
of +1% from Table 3.1. Hence a colour coding of
orange-orange-silver-brown represents a resistor of
value 0.33 & with a tolerance of £1%

Problem 15. Determine the value and tolerance
of a resistor having a colour coding of
brown-black-brown.

The first two bands, i.e. brown-black, give 10 from
Table 3.1.

The third band, brown, indicates a multiplier of 10
from Table 3.1, which means that the value of the resistor
is 10x 10=100Q

There is no fourth band colour in this case; hence,
from Table 3.1, the tolerance is +20%. Hence a colour
coding of brown-black-brown represents a resistor of
value 100 Q with a tolerance of +20%

Problem 16. Between what two values should a
resistor with colour coding brown-black-brown-
silver lie?

From Table 3.1, brown-black-brown-silver indicates
10 x 10, i.e. 100 Q, with a tolerance of +10%
This means that the value could lie between

(100 — 10% of 100) Q
and (100 + 10% of 100) Q

i.e. brown-black-brown-silver indicates any value
between 90 Q and 1102

Problem 17. Determine the colour coding for a
47kQ resistor having a tolerance of +5%

From Table 3.1, 47kQ=47 x 10° has a colour coding
of yellow-violet-orange. With a tolerance of +5%, the
fourth band will be gold.

Hence 47kQ+5% has a colour coding of:
yellow-violet-orange-gold.

Problem 18. Determine the value and tolerance
of a resistor having a colour coding of orange-
green-red-yellow-brown.

Orange-green-red-yellow-brown is a five-band fixed
resistor and from Table 3.1 indicates: 352 x 104 Q with
a tolerance of +1%

352 x 10°Q = 3.52 x 10°Q, ie. 3.52MQ

Hence _ orange-green-red-yellow-brown _ indicates

3.52 M2+1%

(b) Letter and digit code for resistors

Another way of indicating the value of resistors is the
letter and digit code shown in Table 3.2.

Table 3.2

Resistance value Marked as

10MQ 10M

Tolerance is indicated as follows: F=+1%,
=+2%, J=+5%, K =+10% and M=+20%
Thus, for example,

R33M = 0.33Q + 20%
ARTK = 4.7Q + 10%
390RJ = 390Q 45%

Problem 19. Determine the value of a resistor
marked as 6K8F

From Table 3.2, 6K8F is equivalent to: 6.8kQ+£1%

Problem 20. Determine the value of a resistor
marked as 4M7M

From Table 3.2, 4M7M is equivalent to: 4.7 MQ + 20%

Problem 21. Determine the letter and digit code
for a resistor having a value of 68kQ+10%

From Table 3.2, 68 kQ + 10% has a letter and digit code
of: 68KK

Batteries and alternative
sources of energy

Why it is important to understand: Batteries and alternative sources of energy

Batteries store electricity in a chemical form, inside a closed-energy system. They can be re-charged
and re-used as a power source in small appliances, machinery and remote locations. Batteries can store
d.c. electrical energy produced by renewable sources such as solar, wind and hydro power in chemical
form. Because renewable energy-charging sources are often intermittent in their nature, batteries provide
energy storage in order to provide a relatively constant supply of power to electrical loads regardless of
whether the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. In an off-grid photovoltaic (PV) system, for example,
battery storage provides a way to power common household appliances regardless of the time of day or the
current weather conditions. In a grid-tie with battery backup PV system, batteries provide uninterrupted
power in case of utility power failure. Energy causes movement; every time something moves, energy is
being used. Energy moves cars, makes machines run, heats ovens, and lights our homes. One form of
energy can be changed into another form. When petrol is burned in a vehicle engine, the energy stored
in petrol is changed into heat energy. When we stand in the sun, light energy is changed into heat. When
a torch or flashlight is turned on, chemical energy stored in the battery is changed into light and heat. To
find energy, look for motion, heat, light, sound, chemical reactions or electricity. The sun is the source of
all energy. The sun’s energy is stored in coal, petroleum, natural gas, food, water and wind. While there
are two types of energy, renewable and non-renewable, most of the energy we use comes from burning
non-renewable fuels — coal, petroleum or oil or natural gas. These supply the majority of our energy
needs because we have designed ways to transform their energy on a large scale to meet consumer needs.
Regardless of the energy source, the energy contained in them is changed into a more useful form of
electricity. This chapter explains the increasingly important area of battery use and briefly looks at some
alternative sources of energy.

Batteries and alternative sources of energy 27

4.1 Introduction to batteries

A battery is a device that converts chemical energy
to electricity. If an appliance is placed between its
terminals the current generated will power the device.
Batteries are an indispensable item for many electronic
devices and are essential for devices that require power
when no mains power is available. For example, without
the battery there would be no mobile phones or laptop
computers.

The battery is now over 200 years old and batteries are
found almost everywhere in consumer and industrial
products. Some practical examples where batteries are
used include:

in laptops, in cameras, in mobile phones, in
cars, in watches and clocks, for security equip-
ment, in electronic meters, for smoke alarms, for
meters used to read gas, water and electricity
consumption at home, to power a camera for an
endoscope looking internally at the body, and for
transponders used for toll collection on highways
throughout the world.

Batteries tend to be split into two categories — primary,
which are not designed to be electrically re-charged,
i.e. are disposable (see Section 4.6), and secondary
batteries, which are designed to be re-charged, such
as those used in mobile phones (see Section 4.7).

In more recent years it has been necessary to design
batteries with reduced size, but with increased lifespan
and capacity.

If an application requires small size and high power then
the 1.5 V battery is used. If longer lifetime is required
then the 3 to 3.6V battery is used. In the 1970s the
1.5 V manganese battery was gradually replaced by
the alkaline battery. Silver oxide batteries were grad-
ually introduced in the 1960s and are still the preferred
technology for watch batteries today.

Lithium-ion batteries were introduced in the 1970s
because of the need for longer lifetime applications.

Indeed, some such batteries have been known to last
well over ten years before replacement, a characteris-
tic that means that these batteries are still very much
in demand today for digital cameras, and sometimes
for watches and computer clocks. Lithium batteries
are capable of delivering high currents but tend to be
expensive.

More types of batteries and their uses are listed in
Table 4.2 on page 34.

4.2 Some chemical effects

of electricity

A material must contain charged particles to be able to
conduct electric current. In solids, the current is carried
by electrons. Copper, lead, aluminium, iron and carbon
are some examples of solid conductors. In liquids and
gases, the current is carried by the part of a molecule
which has acquired an electric charge, called ions.
These can possess a positive or negative charge, and
examples include hydrogen ion Ht, copper ion Cu**
and hydroxyl ion OH~. Distilled water contains no
ions and is a poor conductor of electricity, whereas salt
water contains ions and is a fairly good conductor of
electricity.

Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid compound
by the passage of electric current through it. Practical
applications of electrolysis include the electroplating
of metals (see below), the refining of copper and the
extraction of aluminium from its ore.

An electrolyte is a compound which will undergo elec-
trolysis. Examples include salt water, copper sulphate
and sulphuric acid.

The electrodes are the two conductors carrying current
to the electrolyte. The positive-connected electrode is
called the anode and the negative-connected electrode
the cathode.

When two copper wires connected to a battery are placed
in a beaker containing a salt water solution, current will


28 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

flow through the solution. Air bubbles appear around the
wires as the water is changed into hydrogen and oxygen
by electrolysis.

Electroplating uses the principle of electrolysis to
apply a thin coat of one metal to another metal. Some
practical applications include the tin-plating of steel,
silver-plating of nickel alloys and chromium-plating of
steel. If two copper electrodes connected to a battery
are placed in a beaker containing copper sulphate as the
electrolyte it is found that the cathode (i.e. the electrode
connected to the negative terminal of the battery) gains
copper whilst the anode loses copper.

4.3 The simple cell

The purpose of an electric cell is to convert chemical
energy into electrical energy.

A simple cell comprises two dissimilar conductors
(electrodes) in an electrolyte. Such a cell is shown in
Figure 4.1, comprising copper and zinc electrodes. An
electric current is found to flow between the electrodes.
Other possible electrode pairs exist, including zinc—lead
and zinc—iron. The electrode potential (i.e. the p.d.
measured between the electrodes) varies for each pair
of metals. By knowing the e.m.f. of each metal with
respect to some standard electrode, the e.m.f. of any
pair of metals may be determined. The standard used is
the hydrogen electrode. The electrochemical series is
a way of listing elements in order of electrical potential,
and Table 4.1 shows a number of elements in such
a series.

In a simple cell two faults exist — those due to
polarization and local action.

Table 4.1 Part of the electro-
chemical series

Carbon

Polarization

If the simple cell shown in Figure 4.1 is left connected
for some time, the current J decreases fairly rapidly.
This is because of the formation of a film of hydrogen
bubbles on the copper anode. This effect is known as
the polarization of the cell. The hydrogen prevents full
contact between the copper electrode and the electrolyte
and this increases the internal resistance of the cell. The
effect can be overcome by using a chemical depolariz-
ing agent or depolarizer, such as potassium dichromate,
which removes the hydrogen bubbles as they form. This
allows the cell to deliver a steady current.

Local action

When commercial zinc is placed in dilute sulphuric acid,
hydrogen gas is liberated from it and the zinc dissolves.
The reason for this is that impurities, such as traces of
iron, are present in the zinc which set up small primary
cells with the zinc. These small cells are short-circuited
by the electrolyte, with the result that localized currents
flow, causing corrosion. This action is known as local
action of the cell. This may be prevented by rubbing
a small amount of mercury on the zinc surface, which
forms a protective layer on the surface of the electrode.

When two metals are used in a simple cell the elec-
trochemical series may be used to predict the behaviour
of the cell:

(i) The metal that is higher in the series acts as the
negative electrode, and vice-versa. For example,

Batteries and alternative sources of energy 29

the zinc electrode in the cell shown in Figure 4.1
is negative and the copper electrode is positive.

(ii) The greater the separation in the series between
the two metals the greater is the e.m.f. produced
by the cell.

The electrochemical series is representative of the order
of reactivity of the metals and their compounds:

Gi) The higher metals in the series react more readily
with oxygen and vice-versa.

(ii) When two metal electrodes are used in a simple
cell the one that is higher in the series tends to
dissolve in the electrolyte.

Corrosion is the gradual destruction of a metal in a
damp atmosphere by means of simple cell action. In
addition to the presence of moisture and air required
for rusting, an electrolyte, an anode and a cathode are
required for corrosion. Thus, if metals widely spaced in
the electrochemical series are used in contact with each
other in the presence of an electrolyte, corrosion will
occur. For example, if a brass valve is fitted to a heating
system made of steel, corrosion will occur.

The effects of corrosion include the weakening of
structures, the reduction of the life of components and
materials, the wastage of materials and the expense of
replacement.

Corrosion may be prevented by coating with paint,
grease, plastic coatings and enamels, or by plating with
tin or chromium. Also, iron may be galvanized, i.e.
plated with zinc, the layer of zinc helping to prevent
the iron from corroding.

4.5 E.m.f. and internal resistance

of a cell

The electromotive force (e.m.f.), E, of a cell is the p.d.
between its terminals when it is not connected to a load
(i.e. the cell is on ‘no load’).

The e.m.f. of a cell is measured by using a high resis-
tance voltmeter connected in parallel with the cell. The
voltmeter must have a high resistance otherwise it will
pass current and the cell will not be on ‘no-load’. For
example, if the resistance of a cell is 1 Q and that of
a voltmeter 1 MQ, then the equivalent resistance of the
circuit is 1MQ+1Q, i.e. approximately 1 MQ, hence
no current flows and the cell is not loaded.

The voltage available at the terminals of a cell falls
when a load is connected. This is caused by the internal
resistance of the cell which is the opposition of the
material of the cell to the flow of current. The internal
resistance acts in series with other resistances in the
circuit. Figure 4.2 shows a cell of e.m.f. E volts and
internal resistance, r, and XY represents the terminals
of the cell.

=<

Figure 4.2

When a load (shown as resistance R) is not connected,
no current flows and the terminal p.d., V= E. When R is
connected a current J flows which causes a voltage drop
in the cell, given by Jr. The p.d. available at the cell ter-
minals is less than the e.m.f. of the cell and is given by:

V=E-Ir

Thus if a battery of e.m.f. 12 volts and internal
resistance 0.01 Q delivers a current of 100A, the ter-
minal p.d.,

V =12—(100)(0.01)
=12-1=11V

When different values of potential difference V
across a cell or power supply are measured for different
values of current J, a graph may be plotted as shown
in Figure 4.3. Since the e.m.f. E of the cell or power
supply is the p.d. across its terminals on no load (i.e.
when J =0), then E is as shown by the broken line.

Since V = E — Ir then the internal resistance may be
calculated from

When a current is flowing in the direction shown in
Figure 4.2 the cell is said to be discharging (E > V).
When a current flows in the opposite direction to that
shown in Figure 4.2 the cell is said to be charging
(V>E).

A battery is a combination of more than one cell.
The cells in a battery may be connected in series or
in parallel.

(i) For cells connected in series:
Total e.m.f. = sum of cells’ e.m.f.s

Total internal resistance = sum of cells’ internal
resistances

(ii) For cells connected in parallel:

If each cell has the same e.m.f. and internal
resistance:

Total e.m.f. = e.m.f. of one cell
Total internal resistance of n cells

=— x internal resistance of one cell

Problem 1. Eight cells, each with an internal
resistance of 0.2 Q and an e.m.f. of 2.2 V are
connected (a) in series, (b) in parallel. Determine
the e.m.f. and the internal resistance of the batteries
so formed.
(a) When connected in series, total e.m.f.
=sum of cells’ e.m.f.

Total internal resistance

=2.2V

Total internal resistance of 8 cells

Problem 2. A cell has an internal resistance of
0.02 Q and an e.m.f. of 2.0 V. Calculate its terminal
p.d. if it delivers (a) 5 A, (b) 50A.

(a) Terminal p.d. V=E-—Jr where E =e.m.f. of
cell, J = current flowing and r = internal resis-
tance of cell

E=2.0V,1 =5Aandr =0.02Q

Hence terminal p.d.

V =2.0—(5)(0.02) =2.0-0.1=1.9V

(b) When the current is 50A, terminal p.d.,
V =E-—-Ir=2.0—50(0.02)
i.e. V=2.0-10=1.0V

Thus the terminal p.d. decreases as the current
drawn increases.

Problem 3. The p.d. at the terminals of a battery
is 25 V when no load is connected and 24 V when a
load taking 10 A is connected. Determine the
internal resistance of the battery.

When no load is connected the e.m-f. of the battery, E,
is equal to the terminal p.d., V, ie. E=25V
When current J = 10A and terminal p.d.

V =24V, thenV = E—Ir
Le. 24 = 25 — (10)r
Hence, rearranging gives
10r = 25—24=1

and the internal resistance,

Problem 4. Ten 1.5 V cells, each having an
internal resistance of 0.2 Q, are connected in series
to a load of 58 Q. Determine (a) the current flowing
in the circuit and (b) the p.d. at the battery terminals.

(a) For ten cells, battery e.m.f., E=10 x 1.5=15V,
and the total internal resistance, r=10 x 0.2=2Q.

4.6 Primary cells

Primary cells cannot be recharged, that is, the con-
version of chemical energy to electrical energy is irre-
versible and the cell cannot be used once the chemicals
are exhausted. Examples of primary cells include the
Leclanché cell and the mercury cell.


32 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

Leclanché* cell

A typical dry Leclanché cell is shown in Figure 4.6. Such
a cell has an e.m.f. of about 1.5 V when new, but this
falls rapidly if in continuous use due to polarization. The
hydrogen film on the carbon electrode forms faster than
can be dissipated by the depolarizer. The Leclanché cell
is suitable only for intermittent use; applications include
torches, transistor radios, bells, indicator circuits, gas
lighters, controlling switch-gear, and so on. The cell
is the most commonly used of primary cells, is cheap,
requires little maintenance and has a shelf life of about
two years.

stant for a relatively long time. Its main advantages over
the Leclanché cell is its smaller size and its long shelf
life. Typical practical applications include hearing aids,
medical electronics, cameras and guided missiles.

4.7 Secondary cells

Secondary cells can be recharged after use, that is, the
conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy is
reversible and the cell may be used many times. Exam-
ples of secondary cells include the lead—acid cell and the
nickel cadmium and nickel—metal cells. Practical appli-
cations of such cells include car batteries, telephone
circuits and for traction purposes — such as milk delivery
vans and fork-lift trucks.

Lead-acid cell
A typical lead-acid cell is constructed of:
(i) Acontainer made of glass, ebonite or plastic.

(ii) Lead plates

(a) the negative plate (cathode) consists of
spongy lead

(b) the positive plate (anode) is formed by press-
ing lead peroxide into the lead grid.

The plates are interleaved as shown in the plan
view of Figure 4.8 to increase their effective
cross-sectional area and to minimize internal
resistance.

(iii) Separators made of glass, celluloid or wood.

(iv) An electrolyte which is a mixture of sulphuric
acid and distilled water.

The relative density (or specific gravity) of a lead—acid
cell, which may be measured using a hydrometer, varies
between about 1.26 when the cell is fully charged to
about 1.19 when discharged. The terminal p.d. of a lead—
acid cell is about 2 V.

When a cell supplies current to a load it is said to be
discharging. During discharge:

(i) the lead peroxide (positive plate) and the spongy
lead (negative plate) are converted into lead sul-
phate, and

Batteries and alternative sources ofenergy 33

(ii) the oxygen in the lead peroxide combines with
hydrogen in the electrolyte to form water. The
electrolyte is therefore weakened and the relative
density falls.

The terminal p.d. of a lead—acid cell when fully dis-
charged is about 1.8 V. A cell is charged by connecting
a d.c. supply to its terminals, the positive terminal of
the cell being connected to the positive terminal of the
supply. The charging current flows in the reverse direc-
tion to the discharge current and the chemical action is
reversed. During charging:

(i) the lead sulphate on the positive and negative
plates is converted back to lead peroxide and lead,
respectively, and

(ii) the water content of the electrolyte decreases as
the oxygen released from the electrolyte combines
with the lead of the positive plate. The relative
density of the electrolyte thus increases.

The colour of the positive plate when fully charged is
dark brown and when discharged is light brown. The
colour of the negative plate when fully charged is grey
and when discharged is light grey.

Nickel cadmium and nickel-metal cells

In both types the positive plate is made of nickel
hydroxide enclosed in finely perforated steel tubes, the
resistance being reduced by the addition of pure nickel
or graphite. The tubes are assembled into nickel-steel
plates.

In the nickel—metal cell (sometimes called the Edi-
son* cell or nife cell), the negative plate is made of
iron oxide, with the resistance being reduced by a little
mercuric oxide, the whole being enclosed in perforated
steel tubes and assembled in steel plates. In the nickel—
cadmium cell the negative plate is made of cadmium.
The electrolyte in each type of cell is a solution of potas-
sium hydroxide which does not undergo any chemical
change and thus the quantity can be reduced to a min-
imum. The plates are separated by insulating rods and
assembled in steel containers which are then enclosed
in a non-metallic crate to insulate the cells from one
another. The average discharge p.d. of an alkaline cell
is about 1.2 V.

Advantages of a nickel cadmium cell or a nickel-
metal cell over a lead—acid cell include:

(i) more robust construction

*Who was Edison? Go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

(ii) capable of withstanding heavy charging and dis-
charging currents without damage

(iii) has a longer life
(iv) fora given capacity is lighter in weight

(v) can be left indefinitely in any state of charge or
discharge without damage

(vi) is not self-discharging.

Disadvantages of a nickel cadmium and nickel—metal
cell over a lead—acid cell include:

(i) is relatively more expensive

(ii) requires more cells for a given e.m_f.
(iii) has a higher internal resistance
(iv) must be kept sealed

(v) has a lower efficiency.

Nickel cells may be used in extremes of temperature,
in conditions where vibration is experienced or where
duties require long idle periods or heavy discharge cur-
rents. Practical examples include traction and marine
work, lighting in railway carriages, military portable
radios and for starting diesel and petrol engines.

See also Table 4.2, page 34.

4.8 Cell capacity

The capacity of a cell is measured in ampere-hours
(Ah). A fully charged 50 Ah battery rated for 10h dis-
charge can be discharged at a steady current of 5 A for
10h, but if the load current is increased to 10 A then the
battery is discharged in 34h, since the higher the dis-
charge current, the lower is the effective capacity of the
battery. Typical discharge characteristics for a lead—acid
cell are shown in Figure 4.9

4.9 Safe disposal of batteries

Battery disposal has become a topical subject in the UK
because of greater awareness of the dangers and impli-
cations of depositing up to 300 million batteries per
annum — a waste stream of over 20000 tonnes — into
landfill sites.

Certain batteries contain substances which can be a
hazard to humans, wildlife and the environment, as well
as posing a fire risk. Other batteries can be recycled for
their metal content.

Waste batteries are a concentrated source of toxic
heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium. If
batteries containing heavy metals are disposed of incor-
rectly, the metals can leach out and pollute the soil
and groundwater, endangering humans and wildlife.
Long-term exposure to cadmium, a known human car-
cinogen (i.e. a substance producing cancerous growth),
can cause liver and lung disease. Mercury can cause
damage to the human brain, spinal system, kidneys and
liver. Sulphuric acid in lead—acid batteries can cause
severe skin burns or irritation upon contact. It is increas-
ingly important to correctly dispose of all types of
batteries.

Table 4.2 lists types of batteries, their common uses,
their hazardous components and disposal recycling
options.

Battery disposal has become more regulated since
the Landfill Regulations 2002 and Hazardous Waste
Regulations 2005. From the Waste Electrical and Elec-
tronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations 2006, com-
mencing July 2007 all producers (manufacturers and
importers) of electrical and electronic equipment
will be responsible for the cost of collection, treat-
ment and recycling of obligated WEEE generated in
the UK.

4.10 Fuelcells

A fuel cell is an electrochemical energy conversion
device, similar to a battery, but differing from the latter
in that it is designed for continuous replenishment of
the reactants consumed, i.e. it produces electricity from
an external source of fuel and oxygen, as opposed to
the limited energy storage capacity of a battery. Also,
the electrodes within a battery react and change as a
battery is charged or discharged, whereas a fuel cell’s
electrodes are catalytic (i.e. not permanently changed)
and relatively stable.

Batteries and alternative sources ofenergy 35

Typical reactants used in a fuel cell are hydrogen
on the anode side and oxygen on the cathode side
(i.e. a hydrogen cell). Usually, reactants flow in and
reaction products flow out. Virtually continuous long-
term operation is feasible as long as these flows are
maintained.

Fuel cells are very attractive in modern applications
for their high efficiency and ideally emission-free use, in
contrast to currently more modern fuels such as methane
or natural gas that generate carbon dioxide. The only
by-product of a fuel cell operating on pure hydrogen is
water vapour.

Currently, fuel cells are a very expensive alterna-
tive to internal combustion engines. However, contin-
ued research and development is likely to make fuel
cell vehicles available at market prices within a few
years.

Fuel cells are very useful as power sources in remote
locations, such as spacecraft, remote weather stations,
and in certain military applications. A fuel cell running
on hydrogen can be compact, lightweight and has no
moving parts.

4.11 Alternative and renewable

energy sources

Alternative energy refers to energy sources which
could replace coal, traditional gas and oil, all of
which increase the atmospheric carbon when burned
as fuel.
Renewable energy implies that it is derived from a
source which is automatically replenished or one that is
effectively infinite so that it is not depleted as it is used.
Coal, gas and oil are not renewable because, although
the fields may last for generations, their time span is
finite and will eventually run out.

There are many means of harnessing energy which
have less damaging impacts on our environment, includ-
ing the following:

1. Solar energy is one of the most resourceful sources
of energy for the future. The reason for this is that
the total energy received each year from the sun is
around 35 000 times the total energy used by man.
However, about one-third of this energy is either
absorbed by the outer atmosphere or reflected back
into space. Solar energy could be used to run cars,
power plants and space ships. Solar panels on roofs
capture heat in water storage systems. Photovoltaic


36 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

cells, when suitably positioned, convert sunlight to
electricity.

Wind power is another alternative energy source
that can be used without producing by-products that
are harmful to nature. The fins of a windmill rotate
in a vertical plane which is kept vertical to the wind
by means of a tail fin and as wind flow crosses the
blades of the windmill it is forced to rotate and can
be used to generate electricity (see Chapter 9). Like
solar power, harnessing the wind is highly depen-
dent upon weather and location. The average wind
velocity of Earth is around 9 m/s, and the power that
could be produced when a windmill is facing a wind
of 10 m.p.h. (i.e. around 4.5 m/s) is around 50 watts.
Hydroelectricity is achieved by the damming
of rivers and utilizing the potential energy in the
water. As the water stored behind a dam is released
at high pressure, its kinetic energy is transferred
onto turbine blades and used to generate electricity.
The system has enormous initial costs but has

relatively low maintenance costs and provides
power quite cheaply.

Tidal power utilizes the natural motion of the tides
to fill reservoirs which are then slowly discharged
through electricity-producing turbines.
Geothermal energy is obtained from the internal
heat of the planet and can be used to generate steam
to run a steam turbine which, in turn, generates elec-
tricity. The radius of the Earth is about 4000 miles,
with an internal core temperature of around 4000°C
at the centre. Drilling 3 miles from the surface of
the Earth, a temperature of 100°C is encountered;
this is sufficient to boil water to run a steam-
powered electric power plant. Although drilling 3
miles down is possible, it is not easy. Fortunately,
however, volcanic features called geothermal
hotspots are found all around the world. These are
areas which transmit excess internal heat from the
interior of the Earth to the outer crust, which can
be used to generate electricity.

Series and parallel networks

There are two ways in which components may be connected together in an electric circuit. One way is ‘in
series’ where components are connected ‘end-to-end’; another way is ‘in parallel’ where components are
connected ‘across each other’. When a circuit is more complicated than two or three elements, it is very
likely to be a network of individual series and parallel circuits. A firm understanding of the basic principles
associated with series and parallel circuits is a sufficient background to begin an investigation of any single-
source d.c. network having a combination of series and parallel elements or branches. Confidence in the
analysis of series-parallel networks comes only through exposure, practice and experience. At first glance,
these circuits may seem very complicated, but with a methodical analysis approach the functionality of
the circuit can become obvious. This chapter explains with examples, series, parallel and series/parallel
networks. The relationships between voltages, currents and resistances for these networks are considered
through calculations.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

e calculate unknown voltages, currents and resistances in a series circuit

e understand voltage division in a series circuit

e calculate unknown voltages, currents and resistances in a parallel network

e calculate unknown voltages, currents and resistances in series-parallel networks

Figure 5.1 shows three resistors, Ri, R2 and R3, con-
nected end to end, i.e. in series, with a battery source
of V volts. Since the circuit is closed a current J will
flow and the p.d. across each resistor may be determined
from the voltmeter readings V\, V2 and V3

R, Ro Rg

Figure 5.1

In a series circuit

(a) The current / is the same in all parts of the circuit
and hence the same reading is found on each of
the two ammeters shown.

(b) The sum of the voltages Vj, V2 and V3 is equal to
the total applied voltage, V, i.e.

V=Vi4+V24+V3

From Ohm’s law:
V, =1R,, V2 = IR, V3 = IR3 and V =IR

where R is the total circuit resistance.
Since V=V, + V2 + V3

then JR =/R,+/R2+IR3
Dividing throughout by J gives

R=R,+R2+R3

Thus for a series circuit, the total resistance is obtained
by adding together the values of the separate resistances.

determine (a) the battery voltage V, (b) the total

respectively.

It is important to note that current division can only be
applied to two parallel resistors. If there are more than
two parallel resistors, then current division cannot be
determined using the above formulae.

The equivalent resistance of resistors R3 and R,
in parallel is equal to 25 Q — 6Q, ie. 19Q.
There are three methods whereby R, can be
determined.

Method 1

The voltage V; =/R, where R is 6 Q, from above,
ie. Vj =(10)(6)=60V
Hence V2 =250 V — 60 V=190 V =p.d. across R3

=p.d. across Ry

V> 190
h= R. = Gg =5A. Thus 14 =54 also,
since [=10A
V> 190
Thus Ry = — =— =38
14 5
Method 2

Since the equivalent resistance of R3 and R, in
parallel is 19 Q,

38R, . product
~ 38 +R, sum

Hence 19(38 + R,) = 38R,

19

722+ 19R, = 38R,
722 = 38R, — 19R, = 19R,

722

Method 3

When two resistors having the same value are
connected in parallel the equivalent resistance is
always half the value of one of the resistors.
Thus, in this case, since Rr = 19Q and R3=38Q,
then R, =38Q could have been deduced on
sight.

5.5 Loading effect

Loading effect is the terminology used when a measur-
ing instrument such as an oscilloscope or voltmeter is
connected across a component and the current drawn
by the instrument upsets the circuit under test. The best
way of demonstrating loading effect is by a numerical
example.

In the simple circuit of Figure 5.32, the voltage across
each of the resistors can be calculated using voltage
division, or by inspection. In this case, the voltage shown
as V should be 20 V.

of 20 V to 10.91 V.

When taking measurements, it is vital that the load-
ing effect is understood and kept in mind at all times.
An incorrect voltage reading may be due to this load-
ing effect rather than the equipment under investigation
being defective. Ideally, the resistance of a voltmeter
should be infinite.

5.6 Potentiometers and rheostats

It is frequently desirable to be able to vary the value of
a resistor in a circuit. A simple example of this is the
volume control of a radio or television set.

Voltages and currents may be varied in electrical circuits
by using potentiometers and rheostats.

Potentiometers

When a variable resistor uses three terminals, it is
known as a potentiometer. The potentiometer provides
an adjustable voltage divider circuit, which is useful
as a means of obtaining various voltages from a fixed
potential difference. Consider the potentiometer circuit
shown in Figure 5.35 incorporating a lamp and supply
voltage V.

Lamp

Figure 5.35

In the circuit of Figure 5.35, the input voltage is
applied across points A and B at the ends of the poten-
tiometer, while the output is tapped off between the
sliding contact S and the fixed end B. It will be seen that
with the slider at the far left-hand end of the resistor,
the full voltage will appear across the lamp, and as the
slider is moved towards point B the lamp brightness will
reduce. When S is at the far right of the potentiometer,
the lamp is short-circuited, no current will flow through
it, and the lamp will be fully off.

Problem 14. Calculate the volt drop across the
60 © load in the circuit shown in Figure 5.36 when
the slider S is at the halfway point of the 200 Q
potentiometer.

Figure 5.38

The volt drop across the 37.5 Q resistor in Figure 5.38
is the same as the volt drop across both of the parallel
resistors in Figure 5.37.

There are two methods for determining the volt
drop, Vsp:

Method 1

Total circuit resistance, Rr = 1004+ 37.5 = 137.50

30
H ; 1 t, J = —— =0.2182A
ence, supply curren 1375

Thus, volt drop, Vsp = / x 37.5 = 0.2182 x 37.5

= 8.18 V
Method 2
By the principle of voltage division,
37.5
Vsp = 30) = 8.18 V
SB (Goes) (30)

Hence, the volt drop across the 60& load of
Figure 5.36 is 8.18 V

Rheostats

A variable resistor where only two terminals are used,
one fixed and one sliding, is known as a rheostat. The
rheostat circuit, shown in Figure 5.39, similar in con-
struction to the potentiometer, is used to control current
flow. The rheostat also acts as a dropping resistor, reduc-
ing the voltage across the load, but is more effective at
controlling current.

For this reason the resistance of the rheostat should
be greater than that of the load, otherwise it will
have little or no effect. Typical uses are in a train set
or Scalextric. Another practical example is in varying
the brilliance of the panel lighting controls in a car.

The rheostat resistance is connected in series with
the load circuit, RL, with the slider arm tapping off an
amount of resistance (i.e. that between A and S) to pro-
vide the current flow required. With the slider at the far
left-hand end, the load receives maximum current; with
the slider at the far right-hand end, minimum current
flows. The current flowing can be calculated by finding
the total resistance of the circuit (i.e. Rt = Ras + RL),
then by applying Ohm’s law, I = Ras RL

Calculations involved with the rheostat circuit are
simpler than those for the potentiometer circuit.

5.7 Relative and absolute voltages

In an electrical circuit, the voltage at any point can
be quoted as being ‘with reference to’ (w.rt.) any
other point in the circuit. Consider the circuit shown
in Figure 5.46. The total resistance,

Rr = 30+50+5+4 15 = 1009

Figure 5.46

If a voltage at point A is quoted with reference to
point B then the voltage is written as Vag. This is
known as a ‘relative voltage’. In the circuit shown
in Figure 5.46, the voltage at A w.r.t. B is J x 50, ie.
2 x 50=100V and is written as Vag = 100 V

It must also be indicated whether the voltage at A
w.r.t. B is closer to the positive terminal or the negative
terminal of the supply source. Point A is nearer to the
positive terminal than B so is written as Vag = 100 V or
Vag =+100V or Vap = 100 V-+Ve.
If no positive or negative is included, then the voltage is
always taken to be positive.
If the voltage at B w.r.t. A is required, then Vga is nega-
tive and written as Vga =—100V or Vga = 100 V —Vve.
If the reference point is changed to the earth point
then any voltage taken w.rt. the earth is known as
an ‘absolute potential’. If the absolute voltage of
A in Figure 5.46 is required, then this will be the
sum of the voltages across the 50Q and 5 Q resistors,
ie. 100+10=110V and is written as Va =110V or
Va=+110V or Va=110V +Ve, positive since mov-
ing from the earth point to point A is moving towards
the positive terminal of the source. If the voltage is
negative w.r.t. earth then this must be indicated; for
example, Vc =30 V negative w.r.t. earth, and is written
as Vc =—30V or Vc =30V —Ve.

Problem 16. For the circuit shown in Figure 5.47,
calculate (a) the voltage drop across the 4kQ
resistor, (b) the current through the 5 kQ resistor,
(c) the power developed in the 1.5 k resistor,

drop across the 4kQ is 12 V, from part (a). Since
moving from the earth point to point X is mov-
ing towards the negative terminal of the voltage
source, the voltage at point X w.r.t. earth is —12 V.

(e) The ‘absolute voltage at point X’ means the ‘volt-

age at point X w.r.t. earth’, hence the absolute
voltage at point X is —12 V. Questions (d) and
(e) mean the same thing.

5.8 Earth potential and short circuits

The earth, and hence the sea, is at a potential of zero
volts. Items connected to the earth (or sea), i.e. cir-
cuit wiring and electrical components, are said to be
earthed or at earth potential. This means that there is no
difference of potential between the item and earth. A

ship’s hull, being immersed in the sea, is at earth poten-
tial and therefore at zero volts. Earth faults, or short
circuits, are caused by low resistance between the
current-carrying conductor and earth. This occurs when
the insulation resistance of the circuit wiring decreases,
and is normally caused by:

1. dampness
2. insulation becoming hard or brittle with age or heat

3. accidental damage.

Capacitors and capacitance

The capacitor is a widely used electrical component and it has several features that make it useful and
important. A capacitor can store energy, so capacitors are often found in power supplies. Capacitors
are used for timing — for example with a 555 timer IC controlling the charging and discharging; for
smoothing — for example in a power supply; for coupling — for example between stages of an audio system
and a loudspeaker; for filtering — for example in the tone control of an audio system; for tuning — for
example in a radio system; and for storing energy — for example in a camera flash circuit. Capacitors
find uses in virtually every form of electronics circuit from analogue circuits, including amplifiers and
power supplies, through to oscillators, integrators and many more. Capacitors are also used in logic
circuits, primarily for providing decoupling to prevent spikes and ripple on the supply lines which could
cause spurious triggering of the circuits. Capacitors are often used in car stereo systems and hooked up
to the sub-woofer speaker because the loud bass ‘boom’ sounds require a lot of power: the capacitors
store a steady amount of charge and then quickly release it when the sub needs it for its boom. In some
applications a capacitor can be used to reduce the spark created by the opening of the points on a switch
or relay. A capacitor has a voltage that is proportional to the charge that is stored in the capacitor, so a
capacitor can be used to perform interesting computations in op-amp circuits. Circuits with capacitors
exhibit frequency-dependent behaviour so that circuits that amplify certain frequencies selectively can
be built. Capacitors are very important components in electrical and electronic circuits, and this chapter
introduces the terminology and calculations to aid understanding.

Capacitors and capacitance 55

6.1 Introduction to capacitors

A capacitor is an electrical device that is used to store
electrical energy. Next to the resistor, the capacitor is
the most commonly encountered component in electri-
cal circuits. Capacitors are used extensively in electrical
and electronic circuits. For example, capacitors are used
to smooth rectified a.c. outputs, they are used in telecom-
munication equipment — such as radio receivers — for
tuning to the required frequency, they are used in time
delay circuits, in electrical filters, in oscillator circuits
and in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in medical
body scanners, to name but a few practical applications.

6.2 Electrostatic field

Figure 6.1 represents two parallel metal plates, A and B,
charged to different potentials. If an electron that has a
negative charge is placed between the plates, a force will
act on the electron, tending to push it away from the neg-
ative plate B towards the positive plate, A. Similarly, a
positive charge would be acted on by a force tending to
move it towards the negative plate. Any region such as
that shown between the plates in Figure 6.1, in which
an electric charge experiences a force, is called an elec-
trostatic field. The direction of the field is defined as
that of the force acting on a positive charge placed in
the field. In Figure 6.1, the direction of the force is from
the positive plate to the negative plate.

Such a field may be represented in magnitude and
direction by lines of electric force drawn between the

Att++4+++++++4++++4++4+4

charged surfaces. The closeness of the lines is an indica-
tion of the field strength. Whenever a p.d. is established
between two points, an electric field will always exist.
Figure 6.2(a) shows a typical field pattern for an isolated
point charge, and Figure 6.2(b) shows the field pattern
for adjacent charges of opposite polarity. Electric lines
of force (often called electric flux lines) are continu-
ous and start and finish on point charges. Also, the lines
cannot cross each other. When a charged body is placed
close to an uncharged body, an induced charge of oppo-
site sign appears on the surface of the uncharged body.
This is because lines of force from the charged body
terminate on its surface.

The concept of field lines or lines of force is used
to illustrate the properties of an electric field. However,
it should be remembered that they are only aids to the
imagination.

opposite polarity


56 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

The force of attraction or repulsion between two
electrically charged bodies is proportional to the mag-
nitude of their charges and inversely proportional to the
square of the distance separating them,

charge of +1.6\C is given by:

(1.6 x 107°)?
(16 x 10-3)?

arated from each other by air. They are connected to
opposite terminals of a battery of voltage V volts.

There is therefore an electric field in the space
between the plates. If the plates are close together, the
electric lines of force will be straight and parallel and
equally spaced, except near the edge where fringing will
occur (see Figure 6.1). Over the area in which there is
negligible fringing,

6.4 Capacitance

Static electric fields arise from electric charges, elec-
tric field lines beginning and ending on electric charges.
Thus the presence of the field indicates the presence of
equal positive and negative electric charges on the two
plates of Figure 6.3. Let the charge be + Q coulombs on
one plate and — Q coulombs on the other. The property
of this pair of plates which determines how much charge
corresponds to a given p.d. between the plates is called
their capacitance:

capacitance C = <

The unit of capacitance is the farad, F (or more usually
LF = 10°F or pF = 107!” B), which is defined as the
capacitance when a p.d. of one volt appears across the
plates when charged with one coulomb. The unit farad
is named after Michael Faraday.*

6.5 Capacitors

Every system of electrical conductors possesses capac-
itance. For example, there is capacitance between the
conductors of overhead transmission lines and also
between the wires of a telephone cable. In these exam-
ples the capacitance is undesirable but has to be accep-
ted, minimized or compensated for. There are other
situations where capacitance is a desirable property.

Devices specially constructed to possess capacitance
are called capacitors (or condensers, as they used to
be called). In its simplest form a capacitor consists of
two plates which are separated by an insulating material
known as a dielectric. A capacitor has the ability to store
a quantity of static electricity.

The symbols for a fixed capacitor and a variable
capacitor used in electrical circuit diagrams are shown
in Figure 6.4.

Problem 3. A 5\F capacitor is charged so that
the p.d. between its plates is 800 V. Calculate how
long the capacitor can provide an average discharge
current of 2mA.

C =5ynF=5 x 10-°F: V = 800V;
T=2mA=2x107A

Q=CV =5x 10° x 800=4x 10 °C

6.6 Electric flux density

Unit flux is defined as emanating from a positive charge
of 1 coulomb. Thus electric flux Y is measured in
coulombs, and for a charge of Q coulombs, the flux
'’ = Q coulombs.

Electric flux density D is the amount of flux passing
through a defined area A that is perpendicular to the
direction of the flux:

electric flux density, D = £ coulombs/metre”

Electric flux density is also called charge density, o

6.7 Permittivity

At any point in an electric field, the electric field strength
E maintains the electric flux and produces a particular
value of electric flux density D at that point. For a field
established in vacuum (or for practical purposes in air),
the ratio D/E is a constant ¢o, 1.e.

where € is called the permittivity of free space or the
free space constant. The value of ¢9 is 8.85 x 10—!? F/m.

When an insulating medium, such as mica, paper,
plastic or ceramic, is introduced into the region of an
electric field the ratio of D/E is modified:

where ¢,, the relative permittivity of the insulating
material, indicates its insulating power compared with
that of vacuum:

The product ¢o¢; is called the absolute permittivity,
é, Le.

& = &0&;

The insulating medium separating charged surfaces is
called a dielectric. Compared with conductors, dielec-
tric materials have very high resistivities. They are there-
fore used to separate conductors at different potentials,
such as capacitor plates or electric power lines.

(a) Capacitors connected in parallel

Figure 6.6 shows three capacitors, C,, C2 and C3, con-
nected in parallel with a supply voltage V applied across

When the charging current J reaches point A it
divides, some flowing into C;, some flowing into C2
and some into C3. Hence the total charge Or (=I x t)
is divided between the three capacitors. The capacitors
each store a charge and these are shown as Q1, Q2 and
Q3, respectively. Hence

Or =Q1+ Q2+ Q3

charge of —Q coulombs on plate ‘b’. The conductor
between plates ‘b’ and ‘c’ is electrically isolated from
the rest of the circuit so that an equal but opposite
charge of + Q coulombs must appear on plate ‘c’, which,
in turn, induces an equal and opposite charge of —Q

6.12 Practical types of capacitor

Practical types of capacitor are characterized by the
material used for their dielectric. The main types include:
variable air, mica, paper, ceramic, plastic, titanium oxide
and electrolytic.

1.

Variable air capacitors. These usually consist of

two sets of metal plates (such as aluminium), one
fixed, the other variable. The set of moving plates

rotate on a spindle as shown by the end view of

Figure 6.14.


66

Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

Spindle

Figure 6.14

As the moving plates are rotated through half a
revolution, the meshing, and therefore the capaci-
tance, varies from a minimum to a maximum value.
Variable air capacitors are used in radio and elec-
tronic circuits where very low losses are required, or
where a variable capacitance is needed. The maxi-
mum value of such capacitors is between 500 pF
and 1000 pF.

Mica capacitors. A typical older type construction
is shown in Figure 6.15.

Mica sheets

SAN Metal foil

(lead or aluminium)

Figure 6.15

Usually the whole capacitor is impregnated with
wax and placed in a bakelite case. Mica is easily
obtained in thin sheets and is a good insulator. How-
ever, mica is expensive and is not used in capacitors
above about 0.2 wF. A modified form of mica capac-
itor is the silvered mica type. The mica is coated on
both sides with a thin layer of silver which forms
the plates. Capacitance is stable and less likely to
change with age. Such capacitors have a constant
capacitance with change of temperature, a high
working voltage rating and a long service life and
are used in high-frequency circuits with fixed values
of capacitance up to about 1000 pF.

Paper capacitors. A typical paper capacitor is
shown in Figure 6.16 where the length of the roll
corresponds to the capacitance required. The whole
is usually impregnated with oil or wax to exclude
moisture, and then placed in a plastic or aluminium
container for protection. Paper capacitors are made

foil Paper

in various working voltages up to about 150kV
and are used where loss is not very important.
The maximum value of this type of capacitor is
between 500 pF and 10 \1F. Disadvantages of paper
capacitors include variation in capacitance with
temperature change and a shorter service life than
most other types of capacitor.

Ceramic capacitors. These are made in various
forms, each type of construction depending on the
value of capacitance required. For high values, a
tube of ceramic material is used as shown in the
cross-section of Figure 6.17. For smaller values the
cup construction is used as shown in Figure 6.18,
and for still smaller values the disc construction
shown in Figure 6.19 is used. Certain ceramic mate-
rials have a very high permittivity and this enables
capacitors of high capacitance to be made which

are of small physical size with a high working volt-
age rating. Ceramic capacitors are available in the
range 1 pF to 0.1,.F and may be used in high-
frequency electronic circuits subject to a wide range
of temperatures.

Plastic capacitors. Some plastic materials such as
polystyrene and Teflon can be used as dielectrics.
Construction is similar to the paper capacitor
but using a plastic film instead of paper. Plastic
capacitors operate well under conditions of high
temperature, provide a precise value of capacitance,
a very long service life and high reliability.

Titanium oxide capacitors have a very high capa-
citance with a small physical size when used at a
low temperature.

Electrolytic capacitors. Construction is similar to
the paper capacitor, with aluminium foil used for the
plates and with a thick absorbent material, such as
paper, impregnated with an electrolyte (ammonium
borate), separating the plates. The finished capaci-
tor is usually assembled in an aluminium container
and hermetically sealed. Its operation depends on
the formation of a thin aluminium oxide layer on the
positive plate by electrolytic action when a suitable
direct potential is maintained between the plates.
This oxide layer is very thin and forms the dielec-
tric. (The absorbent paper between the plates is a
conductor and does not act as a dielectric.) Such
capacitors must always be used on d.c. and must
be connected with the correct polarity; if this is not
done the capacitor will be destroyed since the oxide
layer will be destroyed. Electrolytic capacitors are
manufactured with working voltage from 6V to
600 V, although accuracy is generally not very high.
These capacitors possess a much larger capacitance
than other types of capacitors of similar dimensions
due to the oxide film being only afew microns thick.
The fact that they can be used only on d.c. supplies
limits their usefulness.

Capacitors and capacitance 67

6.13 Supercapacitors

Electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) are, together
with pseudocapacitors, part of a new type of electro-
chemical capacitor called supercapacitors, also known
as ultracapacitors. Supercapacitors do not have a con-
ventional solid dielectric. The capacitance value of an
electrochemical capacitor is determined by two storage
principles:

(a) Double-layer capacitance is the electrostatic stor-
age of the electrical energy achieved by separation
of charge in a Helmholtz double layer at the inter-
face between the surface of a conductor electrode
and an electrolytic solution electrolyte. The sep-
aration of charge distance in a double-layer is of
the order of a few Angstroms (0.3—-0.8 nm) and is
static in origin.

(b) Pseudocapacitance is the electrochemical storage
of the electrical energy, achieved by redox reac-
tions on the surface of the electrode or by specif-
ically adsorped ions that results in a reversible
faradaic charge-transfer on the electrode.

Double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance both
contribute to the total capacitance value of a superca-
pacitor.

Supercapacitors have the highest available capaci-
tance values per unit volume and the greatest energy
density of all capacitors. Supercapacitors support up
to 12000 F/1.2 V, with specific capacitance values
up to 10000 times that of electrolytic capacitors.
Supercapacitors bridge the gap between capacitors and
batteries. In terms of specific energy as well as in
terms of specific power this gap covers several orders
of magnitude. However, batteries still have about 10
times the capacity of supercapacitors. While exist-
ing supercapacitors have energy densities that are
approximately 10% of a conventional battery, their
power density is generally 10 to 100 times as great.
Power density combines energy density with the speed
at which the energy can be delivered to the load.

Supercapacitors are polarized and must operate with
the correct polarity. Polarity is controlled by design with
asymmetric electrodes, or, for symmetric electrodes, by
a voltage applied during manufacture.

Applications of supercapacitors

Applications of supercapacitors for power and energy
requirements include long, small currents for static


68 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

memory (SRAM) in electronic equipment, power
electronics that require very short, high currents as in
the KERS system in Formula 1 cars, and recovery of
braking energy in vehicles.

Advantages of supercapacitors include:

(i) Long life, with little degradation over hundreds
of thousands of charge cycles. Due to the capac-
itor’s high number of charge—discharge cycles
(millions or more compared to 200 to 1000 for
most commercially available rechargeable bat-
teries) it will last for the entire lifetime of most
devices, which makes the device environmen-
tally friendly. Rechargeable batteries wear out
typically over a few years and their highly reac-
tive chemical electrolytes present a disposal and
safety hazard. Battery lifetime can be optimized
by charging only under favourable conditions,
at an ideal rate and, for some chemistries, as
infrequently as possible. EDLCs can help in con-
junction with batteries by acting as a charge
conditioner, storing energy from other sources
for load balancing purposes and then using
any excess energy to charge the batteries at a
suitable time.

(ii) Low cost per cycle.
(iii) Good reversibility.
(iv) Very high rates of charge and discharge.

(v) Extremely low internal resistance (ESR) and
consequent high cycle efficiency (95% or more)
and extremely low heating levels.

(vi) High output power.

(vii) High specific power; the specific power of elec-
tric double-layer capacitors can exceed 6 kW/kg
at 95% efficiency.

(viii) Improved safety, no corrosive electrolyte and
low toxicity of materials.

(ix) Simple charge methods — no full-charge detec-
tion is needed; no danger of overcharging.

(x) When used in conjunction with rechargeable
batteries, in some applications the EDLC can
supply energy for a short time, reducing battery
cycling duty and extending life.

Disadvantages of supercapacitors include:

(i) The amount of energy stored per unit weight is
generally lower than that of an electrochemical
battery (3 to 5 Wh/kg for a standard ultracapaci-
tor, although 85 Wh/kg has been achieved in the
lab compared to 30 to 40 Wh/kg for a lead—acid
battery, 100 to 250 Wh/kg for a lithium-ion bat-
tery and about 0.1% of the volumetric energy
density of gasoline.

Gi) Has the highest dielectric absorption of any type
of capacitor.

(iii) High self-discharge — the rate is considerably
higher than that of an electrochemical battery.

(iv) Low maximum voltage — series connections are
needed to obtain higher voltages and voltage
balancing may be required.

(v) Unlike practical batteries, the voltage across any
capacitor, including EDLCs, drops significantly
as it discharges. Effective storage and recovery of
energy requires complex electronic control and
switching equipment, with consequent energy
loss.

(vi) Very low internal resistance allows extremely
rapid discharge when shorted, resulting in a spark
hazard similar to any other capacitor of similar
voltage and capacitance (generally much higher
than electrochemical cells).

Summary

Ultracapacitors are some of the best devices available for
delivering a quick surge of power. Because an ultraca-
pacitor stores energy in an electric field, rather than in a
chemical reaction, it can survive hundreds of thousands
more charge and discharge cycles than a battery can.

6.14 Discharging capacitors

When a capacitor has been disconnected from the sup-
ply it may still be charged and it may retain this charge
for some considerable time. Thus precautions must be
taken to ensure that the capacitor is automatically dis-
charged after the supply is switched off. This is done
by connecting a high-value resistor across the capacitor
terminals.

Magnetic circuits

Many common devices rely on magnetism. Familiar examples include computer disk drives, tape
recorders, VCRs, transformers, motors, generators and so on. Practically all transformers and electric
machinery uses magnetic material for shaping and directing the magnetic fields which act as a medium
for transferring and connecting energy. It is therefore important to be able to analyse and describe mag-
netic field quantities for understanding these devices. Magnetic materials are significant in determining
the properties of a piece of electromagnetic equipment or an electric machine, and affect its size and
efficiency. To understand their operation, knowledge of magnetism and magnetic circuit principles is
required. In this chapter, we look at fundamentals of magnetism, relationships between electrical and
magnetic quantities, magnetic circuit concepts and methods of analysis.

7.1 Introduction to magnetism

and magnetic circuits

The study of magnetism began in the thirteenth century
with many eminent scientists and physicists such as
William Gilbert,* Hans Christian Oersted,* Michael
Faraday,* James Maxwell,* André Ampére* and Wil-
helm Weber* all having some input on the subject since.
The association between electricity and magnetism is a
fairly recent finding in comparison with the very first
understanding of basic magnetism.

Today, magnets have many varied practical appli-
cations. For example, they are used in motors and
generators, telephones, relays, loudspeakers, computer
hard drives and floppy disks, anti-lock brakes, cameras,
fishing reels, electronic ignition systems, keyboards, TV
and radio components and in transmission equipment.

The full theory of magnetism is one of the most com-
plex of subjects; this chapter provides an introduction
to the topic.

7.2 Magnetic fields

A permanent magnet is a piece of ferromagnetic
material (such as iron, nickel or cobalt) which has
properties of attracting other pieces of these materi-
als. A permanent magnet will position itself in a north
and south direction when freely suspended. The north-
seeking end of the magnet is called the north pole, N,
and the south-seeking end the south pole, S.

The area around a magnet is called the magnetic field
and it is in this area that the effects of the magnetic force
produced by the magnet can be detected. A magnetic
field cannot be seen, felt, smelled or heard and there-
fore is difficult to represent. Michael Faraday suggested
that the magnetic field could be represented pictorially,
by imagining the field to consist of lines of magnetic
flux, which enables investigation of the distribution and
density of the field to be carried out.

The distribution of a magnetic field can be investi-
gated by using some iron filings. A bar magnet is placed
on a flat surface covered by, say, cardboard, upon which
is sprinkled some iron filings. If the cardboard is gently
tapped the filings will assume a pattern similar to that
shown in Figure 7.1. Ifa number of magnets of different
strength are used, itis found that the stronger the field the

Figure 7.1

closer are the lines of magnetic flux and vice-versa. Thus
a magnetic field has the property of exerting a force,
demonstrated in this case by causing the iron filings to
move into the pattern shown. The strength of the mag-
netic field decreases as we move away from the magnet.
It should be realized, of course, that the magnetic field
is three dimensional in its effect, and not acting in one
plane as appears to be the case in this experiment.

If a compass is placed in the magnetic field in various
positions, the direction of the lines of flux may be deter-
mined by noting the direction of the compass pointer.
The direction of a magnetic field at any point is taken as
that in which the north-seeking pole of a compass needle
points when suspended in the field. The direction of a
line of flux is from the north pole to the south pole on
the outside of the magnet and is then assumed to con-
tinue through the magnet back to the point at which it
emerged at the north pole. Thus such lines of flux always
form complete closed loops or paths, they never inter-
sect and always have a definite direction. The laws of
magnetic attraction and repulsion can be demonstrated
by using two bar magnets. In Figure 7.2(a), with unlike
poles adjacent, attraction takes place. Lines of flux are
imagined to contract and the magnets try to pull together.

Figure 7.2

Magnetic circuits

The magnetic field is strongest in between the two mag-
nets, shown by the lines of flux being close together.
In Figure 7.2(b), with similar poles adjacent (i.e. two
north poles), repulsion occurs, i.e. the two north poles
try to push each other apart, since magnetic flux lines
running side by side in the same direction repel.

7.3 Magnetic flux and flux density

Magnetic flux is the amount of magnetic field (or the
number of lines of force) produced by a magnetic source.
The symbol for magnetic flux is ® (Greek letter ‘phi’).
The unit of magnetic flux is the weber,* Wb.
Magnetic flux density is the amount of flux passing
through a defined area that is perpendicular to the
direction of the flux:

magnetic flux
Magnetic flux density = mae
area

The symbol for magnetic flux density is B. The
unit of magnetic flux density is the tesla,* T, where
1T= 1 Wb/m?. Hence

®
B= q tesla where A(m7) is the area

Problem 1. A magnetic pole face has a

7.4 Magnetomotive force and

magnetic field strength

Magnetomotive force (mmf) is the cause of the exis-
tence of a magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit,

mmf, F’, =NI amperes

where N is the number of conductors (or turns) and J is
the current in amperes. The unit of mmf is sometimes
expressed as ‘ampere-turns’. However, since ‘turns’
have no dimensions, the SI unit of mmf is the ampere.
Magnetic field strength (or magnetizing force),

H= NI/l ampere per metre

where / is the mean length of the flux path in metres.
Thus mmf = NJ = HI amperes.

Problem 3. A magnetizing force of 8000 A/m is
applied to a circular magnetic circuit of mean
diameter 30 cm by passing a current through a coil
wound on the circuit. If the coil is uniformly wound
around the circuit and has 750 turns, find the
current in the coil.

H =8000A/m;1 =a2d =z x30x1072m;
N = 750 turns

NI HI 8000x x x 30x 10-7
Since H=— then, J = =

Thus, current 7=10.05 A

7.5 Permeability and B-H curves

For air, or any non-magnetic medium, the ratio of mag-
netic flux density to magnetizing force is a constant,
i.e. B/H = a constant. This constant is wo, the perme-
ability of free space (or the magnetic space constant)
and is equal to 42 x 10-7 H/m, ice. for air, or any
non-magnetic medium, the ratio B/H = ji). (Although
all non-magnetic materials, including air, exhibit
slight magnetic properties, these can effectively be
neglected.)

For all media other than free space, B/H = 9 [,.

7.9 Hysteresis and hysteresis loss

Hysteresis loop

Let a ferromagnetic material which is completely
demagnetized, i.e. one in which B = H =0 be sub-
jected to increasing values of magnetic field strength
H and the corresponding flux density B measured. The
resulting relationship between B and H is shown by the
curve Oab in Figure 7.8. At a particular value of H,
shown as Oy, it becomes difficult to increase the flux
density any further. The material is said to be saturated.
Thus by is the saturation flux density.

Figure 7.8

If the value of H is now reduced it is found that the
flux density follows curve bc. When H is reduced to
zero, flux remains in the iron. This remanent flux den-
sity or remanence is shown as Oc in Figure 7.8. When

H is increased in the opposite direction, the flux density
decreases until, at a value shown as Od, the flux density
has been reduced to zero. The magnetic field strength Od
required to remove the residual magnetism, i.e. reduce
B to zero, is called the coercive force.

Further increase of H in the reverse direction causes
the flux density to increase in the reverse direction until
saturation is reached, as shown by curve de. If H is var-
ied backwards from Ox to Oy, the flux density follows
the curve efgb, similar to curve bede.

Itis seen from Figure 7.8 that the flux density changes
lag behind the changes in the magnetic field strength.
This effect is called hysteresis. The closed figure
bcdefgb is called the hysteresis loop (or the B/H loop).

Hysteresis loss

A disturbance in the alignment of the domains (i.e.
groups of atoms) of a ferromagnetic material causes
energy to be expended in taking it through a cycle
of magnetization. This energy appears as heat in the
specimen and is called the hysteresis loss.
The energy loss associated with hysteresis is propor-
tional to the area of the hysteresis loop.

The area of a hysteresis loop varies with the type of
material. The area, and thus the energy loss, is much
greater for hard materials than for soft materials.

Figure 7.9 shows typical hysteresis loops for: For a.c.-excited devices the hysteresis loop is repeated

since the energy loss would be considerable. Silicon

Electromagnetism

While the basic facts about magnetism have been known since ancient times, it was not until the early
1800s that the connection between electricity and magnetism was made and the foundations of modern
electromagnetic theory established. In 1819, Hans Christian Oersted, a Danish scientist, demonstrated
that electricity and magnetism were related when he showed that a compass needle was deflected by a
current-carrying conductor. The following year, Andre Ampére showed that current-carrying conductors
attract or repel each other just like magnets. However, it was Michael Faraday who developed our present
concept of the magnetic field as a collection of flux lines in space that conceptually represent both the
intensity and the direction of the field. It was this concept that led to an understanding of magnetism and
the development of important practical devices such as the transformer and the electric generator. In
electrical machines, ferromagnetic materials may form the magnetic circuits (as in transformers), or by
ferromagnetic materials in conjunction with air (as in rotating machines). In most electrical machines, the
magnetic field is produced by passing an electric current through coils wound on ferromagnetic material.
In this chapter important concepts of electromagnetism are explained and simple calculations performed.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

e understand that magnetic fields are produced by electric currents

e apply the screw rule to determine direction of a magnetic field

8.1 Magnetic field due to an electric
current

Magnetic fields can be set up not only by permanent
magnets, as shown in Chapter 7, but also by electric
currents.

Let a piece of wire be arranged to pass vertically
through a horizontal sheet of cardboard, on which is
placed some iron filings, as shown in Figure 8.1 (a).

Current |
direction a

Sheet of
“—" cardboard

lron filings

(a)

Figure 8.1

If a current is now passed through the wire, then
the iron filings will form a definite circular field pat-
tern with the wire at the centre when the cardboard
is gently tapped. By placing a compass in different
positions the lines of flux are seen to have a definite
direction, as shown in Figure 8.1(b). If the current direc-
tion is reversed, the direction of the lines of flux is also
reversed. The effect on both the iron filings and the
compass needle disappears when the current is switched
off. The magnetic field is thus produced by the electric
current. The magnetic flux produced has the same prop-
erties as the flux produced by a permanent magnet. If
the current is increased the strength of the field increases
and, as for the permanent magnet, the field strength
decreases as we move away from the current-carrying
conductor.

In Figure 8.1 the effect of only a small part of the
magnetic field is shown.

If the whole length of the conductor is similarly inves-
tigated it is found that the magnetic field around a
straight conductor is in the form of concentric cylinders
as shown in Figure 8.2, the field direction depending on
the direction of the current flow.

Figure 8.2

When dealing with magnetic fields formed by electric
current it is usual to portray the effect as shown in
Figure 8.3. The convention adopted is:

(i) Current flowing away from the viewer, i.e. into
the paper, is indicated by @. This may be thought
of as the feathered end of the shaft of an arrow.
See Figure 8.3(a).

Gi) Current flowing towards the viewer, i.e. out of the
paper, is indicated by ©. This may be thought of
as the tip of an arrow. See Figure 8.3(b).

The direction of the magnetic lines of flux is best
remembered by the screw rule. This states that:

‘Tf a normal right-hand thread screw is screwed along
the conductor in the direction of the current, the
direction of rotation of the screw is in the direction of
the magnetic field.’

For example, with current flowing away from the
viewer (Figure 8.3(a)) a right-hand thread screw driven
into the paper has to be rotated clockwise. Hence the
direction of the magnetic field is clockwise.

A magnetic field set up by a long coil, or solenoid, is
shown in Figure 8.4(a) and is seen to be similar to that
of a bar magnet. If the solenoid is wound on an iron bar,
as shown in Figure 8.4(b), an even stronger magnetic
field is produced, the iron becoming magnetized and
behaving like a permanent magnet.

Figure 8.5

The magnetic field associated with the solenoid in
Figure 8.5 is similar to the field associated with a bar
magnet and is as shown in Figure 8.6. The polarity of
the field is determined either by the screw rule or by the
grip rule. Thus the north pole is at the bottom and the
south pole at the top.

(b) Magnetic field of an iron-cored solenoid

Figure 8.4

The direction of the magnetic field produced by the
current J in the solenoid may be found by either of two
methods, i.e. the screw rule or the grip rule.

(a) The screw rule states that if a normal right-
hand thread screw is placed along the axis of the
solenoid and is screwed in the direction of the cur-
rent it moves in the direction of the magnetic field
inside the solenoid. The direction of the magnetic
field inside the solenoid is from south to north.
Thus in Figures 8.4(a) and (b) the north pole is to
the right.

(b) The grip rule states that if the coil is gripped
with the right hand, with the fingers pointing in
the direction of the current, then the thumb, out-
stretched parallel to the axis of the solenoid, points
in the direction of the magnetic field inside the
solenoid.

Problem 1. Figure 8.5 shows a coil of wire
wound on an iron core connected to a battery.
Sketch the magnetic field pattern associated with
the current-carrying coil and determine the polarity
of the field.

Figure 8.6

8.2 Electromagnets

The solenoid is very important in electromagnetic the-
ory since the magnetic field inside the solenoid is
practically uniform for a particular current, and is
also versatile, inasmuch that a variation of the current
can alter the strength of the magnetic field. An elec-
tromagnet, based on the solenoid, provides the basis
of many items of electrical equipment, examples of
which include electric bells, relays, lifting magnets and
telephone receivers.

(i) Electric bell

There are various types of electric bell, including the
single-stroke bell, the trembler bell, the buzzer and
a continuously ringing bell, but all depend on the


84 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

attraction exerted by an electromagnet on a soft iron
armature. A typical single-stroke bell circuit is shown
in Figure 8.7. When the push button is operated a
current passes through the coil. Since the iron-cored
coil is energized the soft iron armature is attracted
to the electromagnet. The armature also carries a
striker which hits the gong. When the circuit is bro-
ken the coil becomes demagnetized and the spring
steel strip pulls the armature back to its original posi-
tion. The striker will only operate when the push is
operated.

(ii) Relay

A relay is similar to an electric bell except that con-
tacts are opened or closed by operation instead of a
gong being struck. A typical simple relay is shown
in Figure 8.8, which consists of a coil wound on a
soft iron core. When the coil is energized the hinged
soft iron armature is attracted to the electromagnet

and pushes against two fixed contacts so that they are
connected together, thus closing some other electrical
circuit.

Giii) Lifting magnet

Lifting magnets, incorporating large electromagnets,
are used in iron and steel works for lifting scrap metal.
A typical robust lifting magnet, capable of exerting
large attractive forces, is shown in the elevation and
plan view of Figure 8.9, where a coil, C, is wound
round a central core, P, of the iron casting. Over the
face of the electromagnet is placed a protective non-
magnetic sheet of material, R. The load, Q, which
must be of magnetic material, is lifted when the coils
are energized, the magnetic flux paths, M, being shown
by the broken lines.

(iv) Telephone receiver

Whereas a transmitter or microphone changes sound
waves into corresponding electrical signals, a tele-
phone receiver converts the electrical waves back into
sound waves. A typical telephone receiver is shown in
Figure 8.10 and consists of a permanent magnet with
coils wound on its poles. A thin, flexible diaphragm
of magnetic material is held in position near to the
magnetic poles but not touching them. Variation in
current from the transmitter varies the magnetic field
and the diaphragm consequently vibrates. The vibra-
tion produces sound variations corresponding to those
transmitted.

8.3 Force ona current-carrying

conductor

If a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic
field produced by permanent magnets, then the fields
due to the current-carrying conductor and the permanent
magnets interact and cause a force to be exerted on the
conductor. The force on the current-carrying conductor
in a magnetic field depends upon:

(a) the flux density of the field, B teslas

(b) the strength of the current, 7 amperes

(c) the length of the conductor perpendicular to
the magnetic field, / metres, and

(d) the directions of the field and the current.

When the magnetic field, the current and the conductor
are mutually at right-angles, then:

Force F = Bil newtons

When the conductor and the field are at an angle 0° to
each other then:

Force F = Bil sin 0 newtons

Since when the magnetic field, current and conduc-
tor are mutually at right angles, F = BI, the magnetic
flux density B may be defined by B= F/II, i.e. the
flux density is 1T if the force exerted on 1m of a
conductor when the conductor carries a current of 1A
is IN.

Loudspeaker

A simple application of the above force is the moving-
coil loudspeaker. The loudspeaker is used to convert
electrical signals into sound waves.

Electromagnetism 85

Soft iron pole pieces

Permanent

Figure 8.11

Figure 8.11 shows a typical loudspeaker having a
magnetic circuit comprising a permanent magnet and
soft iron pole pieces so that a strong magnetic field
is available in the short cylindrical air gap. A mov-
ing coil, called the voice or speech coil, is suspended
from the end of a paper or plastic cone so that it lies
in the gap. When an electric current flows through
the coil it produces a force which tends to move the
cone backwards and forwards according to the direc-
tion of the current. The cone acts as a piston, transferring
this force to the air, and producing the required sound
waves.

Problem 2. A conductor carries a current of 20A
and is at right-angles to a magnetic field having a
flux density of 0.9T. If the length of the conductor
in the field is 30cm, calculate the force acting on
the conductor. Determine also the value of the force
if the conductor is inclined at an angle of 30° to the
direction of the field.

B=0.9T; 1 =20A; /=30cm=0.30m

Force F = Bil = (0.9)(20)(0.30) newtons when the
conductor is at right-angles to the field, as shown in
Figure 8.12(a), 1.e. F=5.4N

Figure 8.12

shown in Figure 8.12(b), then force F=Bl/sin@

Le. F=2.7N

If the current-carrying conductor shown in
Figure 8.3(a) is placed in the magnetic field shown
in Figure 8.13(a), then the two fields interact and
cause a force to be exerted on the conductor as shown
in Figure 8.13(b). The field is strengthened above
the conductor and weakened below, thus tending to
move the conductor downwards. This is the basic
principle of operation of the electric motor (see
Section 8.4) and the moving-coil instrument (see
Section 8.5).

Direction of motion
of conductor

(b)

Figure 8.13

The direction of the force exerted on a conductor can
be pre-determined by using Fleming’s* left-hand rule
(often called the motor rule), which states:

Let the thumb, first finger and second finger of the left
hand be extended such that they are all at right-angles
to each other (as shown in Figure 8.14). If the first finger
points in the direction of the magnetic field, the second
finger points in the direction of the current, then the
thumb will point in the direction of the motion of the
conductor.

Summarizing:

First finger — Field
SeCond finger — Current
ThuMb — Motion

Problem 3. Determine the current required in a
400 mm length of conductor of an electric motor,
when the conductor is situated at right-angles to a
magnetic field of flux density 1.2 T, if a force of
1.92 is to be exerted on the conductor. If the

hence current J = ————- =
(1.2)(0.4)

If the current flows downwards, the direction of its mag-
netic field due to the current alone will be clockwise
when viewed from above. The lines of flux will rein-
force (i.e. strengthen) the main magnetic field at the
back of the conductor and will be in opposition in the
front (i.e. weaken the field).

Hence the force on the conductor will be from back
to front (i.e. towards the viewer). This direction
may also have been deduced using Fleming’s left-hand
rule.

Problem 4. A conductor 350mm long carries a
current of 10 A and is at right-angles to a magnetic
field lying between two circular pole faces each of
radius 60mm. If the total flux between the pole
faces is 0.5 mWb, calculate the magnitude of the
force exerted on the conductor.

the field. If the coil carries a current of 120mA,
determine the force exerted on each coil side,
(a) for a single-turn coil, (b) for a coil wound

8.4 Principle of operation of a simple

d.c. motor

A rectangular coil which is free to rotate about a fixed
axis is shown placed inside a magnetic field produced
by permanent magnets in Figure 8.17. A direct current
is fed into the coil via carbon brushes bearing on a com-
mutator, which consists of a metal ring split into two
halves separated by insulation.

/ Axis of

8 Y rotation
Cc

Figure 8.17

When current flows in the coil a magnetic field is
set up around the coil which interacts with the mag-
netic field produced by the magnets. This causes a
force F to be exerted on the current-carrying conduc-
tor which, by Fleming’s left-hand rule, is downwards
between points A and B and upward between C and D
for the current direction shown. This causes a torque and
the coil rotates anticlockwise. When the coil has turned
through 90° from the position shown in Figure 8.17 the

brushes connected to the positive and negative termi-
nals of the supply make contact with different halves
of the commutator ring, thus reversing the direction
of the current flow in the conductor. If the current is
not reversed and the coil rotates past this position the
forces acting on it change direction and it rotates in
the opposite direction, thus never making more than
half a revolution. The current direction is reversed
every time the coil swings through the vertical posi-
tion and thus the coil rotates anticlockwise for as long
as the current flows. This is the principle of opera-
tion of a d.c. motor which is thus a device that takes
in electrical energy and converts it into mechanical
energy.

8.5 Principle of operation

of a moving-coil instrument

A moving-coil instrument operates on the motor prin-
ciple. When a conductor carrying current is placed in a
magnetic field, a force F is exerted on the conductor,
given by F= Bil. If the flux density B is made constant
(by using permanent magnets) and the conductor is a
fixed length (say, a coil) then the force will depend only
on the current flowing in the conductor.

In a moving-coil instrument a coil is placed cen-
trally in the gap between shaped pole pieces as shown
by the front elevation in Figure 8.18(a). (The air gap
is kept as small as possible, although for clarity it is
shown exaggerated in Figure 8.18.) The coil is sup-
ported by steel pivots, resting in jewel bearings, on
a cylindrical iron core. Current is led into and out
of the coil by two phosphor bronze spiral hairsprings
which are wound in opposite directions to minimize
the effect of temperature change and to limit the coil
swing (i.e. to control the movement) and return the
movement to zero position when no current flows.
Current flowing in the coil produces forces as shown
in Figure 8.18(b), the directions being obtained by
Fleming’s left-hand rule. The two forces, F4 and Fz,
produce a torque which will move the coil in a clock-
wise direction, i.e. move the pointer from left to right.
Since force is proportional to current the scale is
linear.

When the aluminium frame, on which the coil is
wound, is rotated between the poles of the magnet,
small currents (called eddy currents) are induced into
the frame, and this provides automatically the nec-
essary damping of the system due to the reluctance
of the former to move within the magnetic field. The

the coil in the correct direction to deflect the pointer ‘up

The range of this sensitive instrument is extended by
using shunts and multipliers (see Chapter 10).

8.6 Force ona charge

When a charge of Q coulombs is moving at a velocity
of v m/s in a magnetic field of flux density B tes-
las, the charge moving perpendicular to the field, then
the magnitude of the force F' exerted on the charge, is
given by:

F = QvB newtons

Problem 7. An electron in a television tube has a
charge of 1.6x10~!° coulombs and travels at
3x10’ m/s perpendicular to a field of flux density
18.5 T. Determine the force exerted on the

Electromagnetic induction

Electromagnetic induction is the production of a potential difference (voltage) across a conductor when
it is exposed to a varying magnetic field. Michael Faraday is generally credited with the discovery of
induction in the 1830s. Faraday’s law of induction is a basic law of electromagnetism that predicts
how a magnetic field will interact with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force (e.m.f.). It
is the fundamental operating principle of transformers, inductors and many types of electrical motors,
generators and solenoids. A.c. generators use Faraday’s law to produce rotation and thus convert electrical
and magnetic energy into rotational kinetic energy. This idea can be used to run all kinds of motors.
Probably one of the greatest inventions of all time is the transformer. Alternating current from the
primary coil moves quickly back and forth across the secondary coil. The moving magnetic field caused
by the changing field (flux) induces a current in the secondary coil. This chapter explains electromagnetic
induction, Faraday’s laws, Lenz’s law and Fleming’s rule and develops various calculations to help
understanding of the concepts.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

9.1 Introduction to electromagnetic

induction

When a conductor is moved across a magnetic field so
as to cut through the lines of force (or flux), an electro-
motive force (e.m.f.) is produced in the conductor. If the
conductor forms part of a closed circuit then the e.m-.f.
produced causes an electric current to flow round the cir-
cuit. Hence an e.m.f. (and thus current) is ‘induced’ in
the conductor as aresult of its movement across the mag-
netic field. This effect is known as ‘electromagnetic
induction’.

Figure 9.1(a) shows a coil of wire connected to a
centre-zero galvanometer, which is a sensitive ammeter
with the zero-current position in the centre of the scale.

(a) When the magnet is moved at constant speed
towards the coil (Figure 9.1(a)), a deflection is
noted on the galvanometer showing that a current
has been produced in the coil.

(b) When the magnet is moved at the same speed as
in (a) but away from the coil the same deflec-
tion is noted but is in the opposite direction (see
Figure 9.1(b)).

(c) When the magnet is held stationary, even within
the coil, no deflection is recorded.

(d) When the coil is moved at the same speed as
in (a) and the magnet held stationary the same
galvanometer deflection is noted.

(e) When the relative speed is, say, doubled, the
galvanometer deflection is doubled.

(f) When a stronger magnet is used, a greater gal-
vanometer deflection is noted.

(g) When the number of turns of wire of the coil
is increased, a greater galvanometer deflection is
noted.

Figure 9.1(c) shows the magnetic field associated with
the magnet. As the magnet is moved towards the coil,
the magnetic flux of the magnet moves across, or
cuts, the coil. It is the relative movement of the mag-
netic flux and the coil that causes an e.m.f., and
thus current, to be induced in the coil. This effect is
known as electromagnetic induction. The laws of elec-
tromagnetic induction stated in Section 9.2 evolved from
experiments such as those described above.

9.2 Laws of electromagnetic

induction

Faraday’s* laws of electromagnetic induction state:

(i) Aninduced e.mf. is set up whenever the magnetic
field linking that circuit changes.
(ii) The magnitude of the induced e.m,f. in any cir-

cuit is proportional to the rate of change of the
magnetic flux linking the circuit.

Lenz’s* law states:

The direction of an induced e.mf. is always such that
it tends to set up a current opposing the motion or the
change of flux responsible for inducing that e.mf.

tive directions is given by Fleming’s* Right-hand rule
(often called the geneRator rule) which states:

Let the thumb, first finger and second finger of the right
hand be extended such that they are all at right-angles
to each other (as shown in Figure 9.2).

Induced e.m.f

Figure 9.2

If the first finger points in the direction of the magnetic
field, the thumb points in the direction of motion of the
conductor relative to the magnetic field, then the second
finger will point in the direction of the induced e.mf.
Summarizing:

First finger — Field

ThuMb — Motion

SEcond finger — E.m-f.

In a generator, conductors forming an electric circuit
are made to move through a magnetic field. By Fara-
day’s law an e.m.f. is induced in the conductors and
thus a source of e.m.f. is created. A generator converts
mechanical energy into electrical energy. (The action
of a simple a.c. generator is described in Chapter 14.)
The induced e.m.f. E set up between the ends of the
conductor shown in Figure 9.3 is given by:

E=Blv volts

where B, the flux density, is measured in teslas, /, the
length of conductor in the magnetic field, is measured

If the conductor moves at an angle 0° to the magnetic
field (instead of at 90°, as assumed above) then

Problem 1. A conductor 300mm long moves at a
uniform speed of 4 m/s at right-angles to a uniform
magnetic field of flux density 1.25 T. Determine the
current flowing in the conductor when (a) its ends
are open-circuited, (b) its ends are connected to a
load of 20 Q resistance.

When a conductor moves in a magnetic field it will have
an e.m.f. induced in it, but this e.m.f. can only produce
a current if there is a closed circuit.

The direction of the e.m.f., and thus the current due
to the e.m.f., may be obtained by either Lenz’s law or
Fleming’s Right-hand rule (i.e. GeneRator rule).

(i) Using Lenz’s law: the field due to the magnet and
the field due to the current-carrying conductor are
shown in Figure 9.5(a) and are seen to reinforce to
the left of the conductor. Hence the force on the
conductor is to the right. However, Lenz’s law
states that the direction of the induced e.m.f. is
always such as to oppose the effect producing it.
Thus the conductor will have to be moved to
the left.

(ii) Using Fleming’s right-hand rule:
First finger — Field, i.e. N — S, or right to left;
ThuMb — Motion, i.e. upwards;
SEcond finger — E.m.f., i.e. towards the viewer

9.3 Rotation of a loop in a magnetic

field

Figure 9.6 shows a view of a looped conductor whose
sides are moving across a magnetic field.

Figure 9.6

The left-hand side is moving in an upward direction
(check using Fleming’s right-hand rule), with length /
cutting the lines of flux which are travelling from left to
right. By definition, the induced e.m.f. will be equal to
Blv sin@ and flowing into the page.

The right-hand side is moving in a downward direc-
tion (again, check using Fleming’s right-hand rule), with
length / cutting the same lines of flux as above. The
induced e.m.f. will also be equal to Blv sin@ but flowing
out of the page.

Therefore the total e.m.f. for the loop conductor

9.4 Inductance

Inductance is the name given to the property of a circuit
whereby there is an e.m.f. induced into the circuit by the
change of flux linkages produced by a current change.
When the e.m.f. is induced in the same circuit as that
in which the current is changing, the property is called
self inductance, L.

When the e.m.f. is induced in a circuit by a change of
flux due to current changing in an adjacent circuit, the
property is called mutual inductance, M.

The unit of inductance is the henry,* H.

A circuit has an inductance of one henry when an e.mf.
of one volt is induced in it by a current changing at the
rate of one ampere per second.

A component called an inductor is used when the prop-
erty of inductance is required in a circuit. The basic form
of an inductor is simply a coil of wire.

Factors which affect the inductance of an inductor
include:

(i) the number of turns of wire — the more turns the
higher the inductance


98 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

(ii) the cross-sectional area of the coil of wire — the
greater the cross-sectional area the higher the
inductance

(iii) the presence of a magnetic core — when the coil
is wound on an iron core the same current sets
up a more concentrated magnetic field and the
inductance is increased

(iv) the way the turns are arranged — a short, thick coil
of wire has a higher inductance than a long, thin
one.

Two examples of practical inductors are shown in
Figure 9.7, and the standard electrical circuit diagram
symbols for air-cored and iron-cored inductors are

An iron-cored inductor is often called a choke since,
when used in a.c. circuits, it has a choking effect,
limiting the current flowing through it. Inductance is

often undesirable in a circuit. To reduce inductance to
a minimum the wire may be bent back on itself, as
shown in Figure 9.9, so that the magnetizing effect
of one conductor is neutralized by that of the adja-
cent conductor. The wire may be coiled around an
insulator, as shown, without increasing the inductance.
Standard resistors may be non-inductively wound in this
manner.

The phenomenon of mutual inductance is used in trans-
formers (see Chapter 20, page 280). Mutual inductance
is developed further in Chapter 43 on magnetically
coupled circuits (see page 656).

Let an iron ring have two coils, A and B, wound on it.

Electrical measuring
instruments and
measurements

Future electrical engineers need to be able to appreciate basic measurement techniques, instruments
and methods used in everyday practice. This chapter covers both analogue and digital instruments,
measurement errors, bridges, oscilloscopes, data acquisition, instrument controls and measurement
systems. Accurate measurements are central to virtually every scientific and engineering discipline.
Electrical measurements often come down to either measuring current or measuring voltage. Even if
you are measuring frequency, you will be measuring the frequency of a current signal or a voltage signal
and you will need to know how to measure either voltage or current. Many times you will use a digital
multimeter —-a DMM - to measure either voltage or current; actually, a DMM will also usually measure
frequency (of a voltage signal) and resistance. The quality of a measuring instrument is assessed from
its accuracy, precision, reliability, durability and so on, all of which are related to its cost.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

e recognize the importance of testing and measurements in electric circuits

e appreciate the essential devices comprising an analogue instrument

e explain the operation of an attraction and a repulsion type of moving-iron instrument
e explain the operation of a moving coil rectifier instrument

e compare moving coil, moving iron and moving coil rectifier instruments

10.1 Introduction

Tests and measurements are important in designing,
evaluating, maintaining and servicing electrical circuits
and equipment. In order to detect electrical quantities
such as current, voltage, resistance or power, it is neces-
sary to transform an electrical quantity or condition into
a visible indication. This is done with the aid of instru-
ments (or meters) that indicate the magnitude of quan-
tities either by the position of a pointer moving over a
graduated scale (called an analogue instrument) or in the
form of a decimal number (called a digital instrument).

The digital instrument has, in the main, become
the instrument of choice in recent years; in particular,
computer-based instruments are rapidly replacing items
of conventional test equipment, with the virtual storage
test instrument, the digital storage oscilloscope, being
the most common. This is explained later in this chapter,
but before that some analogue instruments, which are
still used in some installations, are explored.

10.2 Analogue instruments

All analogue electrical indicating instruments require
three essential devices:

(a) A deflecting or operating device. A mechanical
force is produced by the current or voltage which
causes the pointer to deflect from its zero position.

(b) A controlling device. The controlling force acts
in opposition to the deflecting force and ensures
that the deflection shown on the meter is always
the same for a given measured quantity. It also
prevents the pointer always going to the maximum
deflection. There are two main types of controlling
device — spring control and gravity control.

(c) A damping device. The damping force ensures
that the pointer comes to rest in its final position
quickly and without undue oscillation. There are
three main types of damping used — eddy-current
damping, air-friction damping and fluid-friction
damping.

There are basically two types of scale — linear and
non-linear.

A linear scale is shown in Figure 10.1(a), where
the divisions or graduations are evenly spaced. The
voltmeter shown has a range 0-100V, i.e. a full-scale
deflection (f.s.d.) of 100 V. A non-linear scale is shown
in Figure 10.1(b). The scale is cramped at the beginning
and the graduations are uneven throughout the range.
The ammeter shown has a f.s.d. of 10 A.

10.3 Moving-iron instrument

(a) An attraction type of moving-iron instrument is
shown diagrammatically in Figure 10.2(a). When
current flows in the solenoid, a pivoted soft-iron
disc is attracted towards the solenoid and the
movement causes a pointer to move across a
scale.

A moving-coil instrument, which measures only
d.c., may be used in conjunction with a bridge rectifier
Air-piston damping circuit as shown in Figure 10.3 to provide an indication
of alternating currents and voltages (see Chapter 14).
The average value of the full wave rectified current is
0.6371. However, a meter being used to measure a.c.
is usually calibrated in rm.s. values. For sinusoidal
quantities the indication is (0.707J,)/(0.637In) i.e.
1.11 times the mean value. Rectifier instruments have

10.6 Shunts and multipliers

An ammeter, which measures current, has a low resist-
ance (ideally zero) and must be connected in series with
the circuit.

A voltmeter, which measures p.d., has a high resistance
(ideally infinite) and must be connected in parallel with
the part of the circuit whose p.d. is required.

There is no difference between the basic instrument
used to measure current and voltage since both use
a milliammeter as their basic part. This is a sensitive
instrument which gives f.s.d. for currents of only a few

Figure 10.4

milliamperes. When an ammeter is required to measure
currents of larger magnitude, a proportion of the current
is diverted through a low-value resistance connected in
parallel with the meter. Such a diverting resistor is called
a shunt.

From Figure 10.4(a), Veg = Vrs. Hence Igrg = Is Rs

Tara

Thus the value of the shunt, R,; = ohms

Ss

The milliammeter is converted into a voltmeter by con-
necting a high-value resistance (called a multiplier)
in series with it, as shown in Figure 10.4(b). From
Figure 10.4(b), V = Va + Vy =Irg +1Ru

—Irg

Thus the value of the multiplier, R yy = ohms

Problem 1. A moving-coil instrument gives an
f.s.d. when the current is 40 mA and its resistance is
25 Q. Calculate the value of the shunt to be
connected in parallel with the meter to enable it to
be used as an ammeter for measuring currents up

to 50A.

The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 10.5,

f=50A f,=40mA 50A

Figure 10.5

Electrical measuring instruments and measurements 107

where ra = resistance of instrument = 25 Q,
Rs = resistance of shunt,
Iq = maximum permissible current flowing in

J; = current flowing in shunt,

7 = total circuit current required to give

Thus for the moving-coil instrument to be used as an
ammeter with a range 0-50A, a resistance of value
20.02 mQ needs to be connected in parallel with the
instrument.

Problem 2. A moving-coil instrument having a
resistance of 10 © gives an f.s.d. when the current is
8 mA. Calculate the value of the multiplier to be
connected in series with the instrument so that it
can be used as a voltmeter for measuring p.d.s up to
100 V.

The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 10.6,

Figure 10.6

where rg =resistance of instrument = 10Q,
Rw =resistance of multiplier,
I =total permissible instrument current

V =total p.d. required to give f.s.d. = 100 V

V=V,+ Vy =Irg +IRu
ie. 100=(0.008)(10) + (0.008) Ri
or 100 — 0.08 = 0.008 Ry

99.92
thus Ry =—— =12490Q=12.49k2
0.008

Hence for the moving-coil instrument to be used as a
voltmeter with a range 0-100 V, a resistance of value
12.49kQ needs to be connected in series with the
instrument.

Now try the following Practice Exercise

Practice Exercise 32 Shunts and multipliers
(Answers on page 745)

1. A moving-coil instrument gives f.s.d. for a cur-
rent of 1OmA. Neglecting the resistance of the
instrument, calculate the approximate value of
series resistance needed to enable the instru-
ment to measure up to (a) 20V, (b) 100V,
(c) 250 V.

2. A meter of resistance 50Q has an f.s.d. of
4mA. Determine the value of shunt resistance
required in order that f.s.d. should be (a) 15 mA,
(b) 20 A, (c) 100A.

3. A moving-coil instrument having a resistance
of 20 Q gives an f.s.d. when the current is 5 mA.
Calculate the value of the multiplier to be con-
nected in series with the instrument so that it
can be used as a voltmeter for measuring p.d.s
up to 200 V.

4. A moving-coil instrument has a f.s.d. of 20mA
and a resistance of 25 Q. Calculate the values
of resistance required to enable the instrument
to be used (a) as a0—10 A ammeter, and (b) as a
0-100 V voltmeter. State the mode of resistance
connection in each case.

10.7 Electronic instruments

Electronic measuring instruments have advantages over
instruments such as the moving-iron or moving-coil
meters, in that they have a much higher input resistance
(some as high as 1000 MQ) and can handle a much wider
range of frequency (from d.c. up to MHz).

The digital voltmeter (DVM) is one which provides
a digital display of the voltage being measured. Advan-
tages of a DVM over analogue instruments include
higher accuracy and resolution, no observational or
parallax errors (see Section 10.21) and a very high input
resistance, constant on all ranges.


108 — Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

A digital multimeter is a DVM with additional cir-
cuitry which makes it capable of measuring a.c. voltage,
d.c. and a.c. current and resistance.

Instruments for a.c. measurements are generally cal-
ibrated with a sinusoidal alternating waveform to indi-
cate r.m.s. values when a sinusoidal signal is applied to
the instrument. Some instruments, such as the moving-
iron and electro-dynamic instruments, give a true r.m.s.
indication. With other instruments the indication is
either scaled up from the mean value (such as with the
rectifier moving-coil instrument) or scaled down from
the peak value.

Sometimes quantities to be measured have complex
waveforms (see Section 10.15), and whenever a quan-
tity is non-sinusoidal, errors in instrument readings can
occur if the instrument has been calibrated for sine
waves only.

Such waveform errors can be largely eliminated by
using electronic instruments.

10.8 The ohmmeter

An ohmmeter is an instrument for measuring electrical
resistance.

A simple ohmmeter circuit is shown in Figure 10.7(a).
Unlike the ammeter or voltmeter, the ohmmeter circuit
does not receive the energy necessary for its operation
from the circuit under test. In the ohmmeter this energy
is supplied by a self-contained source of voltage, such as
a battery. Initially, terminals XX are short-circuited and
R adjusted to give f.s.d. on the milliammeter. If current
7 is ata maximum value and voltage E is constant, then
resistance R = E/is at a minimum value. Thus f.s.d. on
the milliammeter is made zero on the resistance scale.
When terminals XX are open circuited no current flows
and R(=E/O) is infinity, oo.

Figure 10.7

The milliammeter can thus be calibrated directly in
ohms. A cramped (non-linear) scale results and is ‘back
to front’, as shown in Figure 10.7(b). When calibrated,
an unknown resistance is placed between terminals XX
and its value determined from the position of the pointer
on the scale. An ohmmeter designed for measuring low
values of resistance is called a continuity tester. An
ohmmeter designed for measuring high values of resis-
tance (i.e. megohms) is called an insulation resistance
tester (c.g. ‘Megger’).

10.9 Multimeters

Instruments are manufactured that combine a moving-
coil meter with a number of shunts and series mul-
tipliers, to provide a range of readings on a single
scale graduated to read current and voltage. If a battery
is incorporated then resistance can also be measured.
Such instruments are called multimeters or universal
instruments or multirange instruments. An ‘Avome-
ter’ is a typical example. A particular range may be
selected either by the use of separate terminals or
by a selector switch. Only one measurement can be
performed at a time. Often such instruments can be
used in a.c. as well as d.c. circuits when a rectifier is
incorporated in the instrument.

Digital multimeters (DMM) are now almost uni-
versally used, the Fluke Digital Multimeter being an
industry leader for performance, accuracy, resolution,
ruggedness, reliability and safety. These instruments
measure d.c. currents and voltages, resistance and con-
tinuity, a.c. (1.m.s.) currents and voltages, temperature
and much more.

10.10 Wattmeters

A wattmeter is an instrument for measuring electrical
power in a circuit. Figure 10.8 shows typical connec-
tions of a wattmeter used for measuring power supplied
to a load. The instrument has two coils:

e calculate the frequency of an oscillating signal

e see the ‘moving parts’ of a circuit represented by
the signal

e  tellif a malfunctioning component is distorting the
signal

e find out how much of a signal is d.c. or a.c.

e tell how much of the signal is noise and whether
the noise is changing with time

Oscilloscopes are used by everyone from television
repair technicians to physicists. They are indispensable
for anyone designing or repairing electronic equipment.
The usefulness of an oscilloscope is not limited to the
world of electronics. With the proper transducer (i.e.
a device that creates an electrical signal in response
to physical stimuli, such as sound, mechanical stress,
pressure, light or heat), an oscilloscope can measure
any kind of phenomena. An automobile engineer uses
an oscilloscope to measure engine vibrations; a medical

researcher uses an oscilloscope to measure brain waves,
and so on.

Oscilloscopes are available in both analogue and dig-
ital types. An analogue oscilloscope works by directly
applying a voltage being measured to an electron beam
moving across the oscilloscope screen. The voltage
deflects the beam up or down proportionally, tracing
the waveform on the screen. This gives an immediate
picture of the waveform.

In contrast, a digital oscilloscope samples the wave-
form and uses an analogue-to-digital converter (see
Section 18.11, page 264) to convert the voltage being
measured into digital information. It then uses this dig-
ital information to reconstruct the waveform on the
screen.

For many applications either an analogue or digital
oscilloscope is appropriate. However, each type does
possess some unique characteristics making it more or
less suitable for specific tasks.

Analogue oscilloscopes are often preferred when it
is important to display rapidly varying signals in ‘real
time’ (i.e. as they occur).

Digital oscilloscopes allow the capture and viewing
of events that happen only once. They can process the
digital waveform data or send the data to a computer
for processing. Also, they can store the digital wave-
form data for later viewing and printing. Digital storage
oscilloscopes are explained in Section 10.14.

Analogue oscilloscopes

When an oscilloscope probe is connected to a circuit, the
voltage signal travels through the probe to the vertical
system of the oscilloscope. Figure 10.14 shows a simple
block diagram that shows how an analogue oscilloscope
displays a measured signal.

Depending on how the vertical scale (volts/division
control) is set, an attenuator reduces the signal voltage or
an amplifier increases the signal voltage. Next, the sig-
nal travels directly to the vertical deflection plates of the
cathode ray tube (CRT). Voltage applied to these deflec-
tion plates causes a glowing dot to move. (An electron
beam hitting phosphor inside the CRT creates the glow-
ing dot.) A positive voltage causes the dot to move up
while a negative voltage causes the dot to move down.
The signal also travels to the trigger system to start or
trigger a ‘horizontal sweep’. Horizontal sweep is a term
referring to the action of the horizontal system causing
the glowing dot to move across the screen. Triggering
the horizontal system causes the horizontal time base
to move the glowing dot across the screen from left
to right within a specific time interval. Many sweeps

in rapid sequence cause the movement of the glowing
dot to blend into a solid line. At higher speeds, the dot
may sweep across the screen up to 500000 times each
second.

Together, the horizontal sweeping action (i.e. the
X direction) and the vertical deflection action (i.e.
the Y direction), trace a graph of the signal on the
screen. The trigger is necessary to stabilize a repeat-
ing signal. It ensures that the sweep begins at the
same point of a repeating signal, resulting in a clear
picture.

In conclusion, to use an analogue oscilloscope, three
basic settings to accommodate an incoming signal need
to be adjusted:

e the attenuation or amplification of the signal —
use the volts/division control to adjust the ampli-
tude of the signal before it is applied to the vertical
deflection plates

e the time base — use the time/division control to
set the amount of time per division represented
horizontally across the screen

e the triggering of the oscilloscope — use the trig-
ger level to stabilize a repeating signal, as well as
triggering on a single event.

Also, adjusting the focus and intensity controls enable
a sharp, visible display to be created.

(i) With direct voltage measurements, only the Y
amplifier ‘volts/cm’ switch on the oscilloscope is
used. With no voltage applied to the Y plates the

position of the spot trace on the screen is noted.
When a direct voltage is applied to the Y plates
the new position of the spot trace is an indication
of the magnitude of the voltage. For example, in
Figure 10.15(a), with no voltage applied to the Y
plates, the spot trace is in the centre of the screen
(initial position) and then the spot trace moves
2.5cm to the final position shown, on application
of a d.c. voltage. With the ‘volts/cm’ switch on
10 volts/cm the magnitude of the direct voltage is
2.5cm x 10 volts/cm, i.e. 25 volts.

(ii) With alternating voltage measurements, let a
sinusoidal waveform be displayed on an oscillo-
scope screen as shown in Figure 10.15(b). If the
time/cm switch is on, say, 5 ms/cm then the peri-
odic time T of the sinewave is 5 ms/cm x 4cm, i.e.

The oscilloscope demands reasonable skill in adjust-
ment and use. However, its greatest advantage is in
observing the shape of a waveform — a feature not
possessed by other measuring instruments.

Digital oscilloscopes

Some of the systems that make up digital oscillo-
scopes are the same as those in analogue oscilloscopes;

Electrical measuring instruments and measurements 113

however, digital oscilloscopes contain additional data
processing systems — as shown in the block diagram
of Figure 10.16. With the added systems, the digital
oscilloscope collects data for the entire waveform and
then displays it.

When a digital oscilloscope probe is attached to a
circuit, the vertical system adjusts the amplitude of
the signal, just as in the analogue oscilloscope. Next,
the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) in the acqui-
sition system samples the signal at discrete points in
time and converts the signals’ voltage at these points
to digital values called sample points. The horizontal
systems’ sample clock determines how often the ADC
takes a sample. The rate at which the clock ‘ticks’ is
called the sample rate and is measured in samples per
second.

The sample points from the ADC are stored in mem-
ory as waveform points. More than one sample point
may make up one waveform point.

Together, the waveform points make up one wave-
form record. The number of waveform points used to
make a waveform record is called a record length. The
trigger system determines the start and stop points of
the record. The display receives these record points after
being stored in memory.

Depending on the capabilities of an oscilloscope,
additional processing of the sample points may take
place, enhancing the display. Pre-trigger may be avail-
able, allowing events to be seen before the trigger

point.

10.13 Virtual test and measuring

instruments

Computer-based instruments are rapidly replacing items
of conventional test equipment in many of today’s test
and measurement applications. Probably the most com-
monly available virtual test instrument is the digital
storage oscilloscope (DSO). Because of the processing
power available from the PC coupled with the mass stor-
age capability, a computer-based virtual DSO is able to
provide a variety of additional functions, such as spec-
trum analysis and digital display of both frequency and
voltage. In addition, the ability to save waveforms and
captured measurement data for future analysis or for
comparison purposes can be extremely valuable, partic-
ularly where evidence of conformance with standards
or specifications is required.

Unlike a conventional oscilloscope (which is pri-
marily intended for waveform display), a computer-
based virtual oscilloscope effectively combines several
test instruments in one single package. The functions
and available measurements from such an instrument
usually includes:

e real-time or stored waveform display

e precise time and voltage measurement (using
adjustable cursors)

e digital display of voltage

e digital display of frequency and/or periodic time

e accurate measurement of phase angle

e frequency spectrum display and analysis

e datalogging (stored waveform data can be exported
in formats that are compatible with conventional
spreadsheet packages, e.g. as .xls files)

e ability to save/print waveforms and other infor-

mation in graphical format (e.g. as .jpg or .bmp
files).

Virtual instruments can take various forms, including:

e internal hardware in the form of a conventional PCI
expansion card

e external hardware unit which is connected to the
PC by means of either a conventional 25-pin par-
allel port connector or by means of a serial USB
connector.

The software (and any necessary drivers) is invari-
ably supplied on CD-ROM or can be downloaded
from the manufacturer’s website. Some manufacturers
also supply software drivers together with sufficient

accompanying documentation in order to allow users
to control virtual test instruments from their own soft-
ware developed using popular programming languages
such as VisualBASIC or C++.

10.14 Virtual digital storage

oscilloscopes

Several types of virtual DSO are currently available.
These can be conveniently arranged into three different
categories according to their application:

e low-cost DSO
e high-speed DSO
e high-resolution DSO.

Unfortunately, there is often some confusion between
the last two categories. A high-speed DSO is designed
for examining waveforms that are rapidly changing.
Such an instrument does not necessarily provide high-
resolution measurement. Similarly, a high-resolution
DSO is useful for displaying waveforms with a high
degree of precision, but it may not be suitable for exam-
ining fast waveforms. The difference between these two
types of DSO should become a little clearer later on.

Low-cost DSO are primarily designed for low-
frequency signals (typically signals up to around
20kHz) and are usually able to sample their signals at
rates of between 10K and 100K samples per second.
Resolution is usually limited to either 8-bits or 12-bits
(corresponding to 256 and 4096 discrete voltage levels,
respectively).

High-speed DSOs are rapidly replacing CRT-based
oscilloscopes. They are invariably dual-channel instru-
ments and provide all the features associated with a
conventional ‘scope’, including trigger selection, time-
base and voltage ranges, and an ability to operate in X-Y
mode.

Additional features available with a computer-based
instrument include the ability to capture transient signals
(as with a conventional digital storage ‘scope’ ) and save
waveforms for future analysis. The ability to analyse a
signal in terms of its frequency spectrum is yet another
feature that is only possible with a DSO (see later).

Upper frequency limit

The upper signal frequency limit of a DSO is determined
primarily by the rate at which it can sample an incom-
ing signal. Typical sampling rates for different types of
virtual instrument are:

Type of DSO

Typical sampling rate

Electrical measuring instruments and measurements 117

Square and pulse waveforms d.c. to 100 kHz

(up to 5kHz)

High-speed DSO 100M to 1000M per second

In order to display waveforms with reasonable accu-
racy it is normally suggested that the sampling rate
should be at least twice and preferably more than five
times the highest signal frequency. Thus, in order to
display a 10 MHz signal with any degree of accuracy
a sampling rate of 50M samples per second will be
required.

The ‘five times rule’ merits a little explanation. When
sampling signals in a digital-to-analogue converter we
usually apply the Nyquist* criterion that the sampling
frequency must be at least twice the highest analogue
signal frequency. Unfortunately, this no longer applies
in the case of a DSO where we need to sample at an even
faster rate if we are to accurately display the signal.
In practise we would need a minimum of about five
points within a single cycle of a sampled waveform in
order to reproduce it with approximate fidelity. Hence
the sampling rate should be at least five times that of the
highest signal frequency in order to display a waveform
reasonably faithfully.

A special case exists with dual channel DSOs. Here
the sampling rate may be shared between the two chan-
nels. Thus an effective sampling rate of 20M samples
per second might equate to 10M samples per second
for each of the two channels. In such a case the upper
frequency limit would not be 4MHz but only a mere
2 MHz.

The approximate bandwidth required to display dif-
ferent types of signals with reasonable precision is given
in the table below:

Bandwidth
required (approx.)

Audio frequency (general) d.c. to 20 kHz

*Who was Nyquist? Go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

Video d.c. to 1OMHz

The general rule is that, for sinusoidal signals, the
bandwidth should ideally be at least double that of the
highest signal frequency whilst for square wave and
pulse signals, the bandwidth should be at least ten times
that of the highest signal frequency.

It is worth noting that most manufacturers define the
bandwidth of an instrument as the frequency at which
a sine wave input signal will fall to 0.707 of its true
amplitude (i.e. the —3 dB point). To put this into context,
at the cut-off frequency the displayed trace will be in
error by a whopping 29%!

Resolution

The relationship between resolution and signal accuracy
(not bandwidth) is simply that the more bits used in the
conversion process the more discrete voltage levels can
be resolved by the DSO. The relationship is as follows:

x =2”

where x is the number of discrete voltage levels and n is
the number of bits. Thus, each time we use an additional
bit in the conversion process we double the resolution
of the DSO, as shown in the table below:

Number of discrete
voltage levels, x

Number of bits, n

10-bit 1024
16-bit 65 536

Buffer memory capacity

A DSO stores its captured waveform samples in a buffer
memory. Hence, for a given sampling rate, the size of

118 — Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

this memory buffer will determine for how long the
DSO can capture a signal before its buffer memory
becomes full.

The relationship between sampling rate and buffer
memory capacity is important. A DSO with a high
sampling rate but small memory will only be able to use
its full sampling rate on the top few time base ranges.

To put this into context, it’s worth considering a sim-
ple example. Assume that we need to display 10000
cycles of a 10 MHz square wave. This signal will occur
in a time frame of | ms. If applying the ‘five times rule’
we would need a bandwidth of at least 50 MHz to display
this signal accurately.

To reconstruct the square wave we would need a min-
imum of about five samples per cycle so a minimum
sampling rate would be 5 x 10 MHz=50M samples per
second. To capture data at the rate of 50M samples
per second for a time interval of 1 ms requires a mem-
ory that can store 50000 samples. If each sample uses
16-bits we would require 100kbyte of extremely fast
memory.

Accuracy

The measurement resolution or measurement accuracy
of a DSO (in terms of the smallest voltage change that
can be measured) depends on the actual range that is
selected. So, for example, on the 1 V range an 8-bit DSO
is able to detect a voltage change of one two hundred and
fifty sixth of a volt or (1/256) V or about 4mV. For most
measurement applications this will prove to be perfectly
adequate as it amounts to an accuracy of about 0.4% of
full-scale.

Figure 10.24 depicts a PicoScope software dis-
play showing multiple windows providing conventional
oscilloscope waveform display, spectrum analyser dis-
play, frequency display and voltmeter display.

Adjustable cursors make it possible to carry out
extremely accurate measurements. In Figure 10.25 the
peak value of the (nominal 10V peak) waveform is
measured at precisely 9625 mV (9.625 V). The time to
reach the peak value (from 0 V) is measured as 246.7 Ls
(0.2467 ms).

The addition of a second time cursor makes it possible
to measure the time accurately between two events. In
Figure 10.26, event ‘o’ occurs 131 ns before the trigger
point whilst event ‘x’ occurs 397 ns after the trigger
point. The elapsed time between these two events is
528 ns. The two cursors can be adjusted by means of the
mouse (or other pointing device) or, more accurately,
using the PC’s cursor keys.

Autoranging

Autoranging is another very useful feature that is often
provided with a virtual DSO. If you regularly use a con-
ventional ‘scope’ for a variety of measurements you
will know only too well how many times you need

High-resolution DSO

High-resolution DSOs are used for precision applica-
tions where it is necessary to faithfully reproduce a
waveform and also to be able to perform an accurate
analysis of noise floor and harmonic content. Typical
applications include small-signal work and high-quality
audio.

Unlike the low-cost DSO, which typically has 8-bit
resolution and poor d.c. accuracy, these units are usu-
ally accurate to better than 1% and have either 12-bit or
16-bit resolution. This makes them ideal for audio, noise
and vibration measurements.

The increased resolution also allows the instrument to
be used as a spectrum analyser with very wide dynamic
range (up to 100dB). This feature is ideal for perform-
ing noise and distortion measurements on low-level
analogue circuits.

Bandwidth alone is not enough to ensure that a DSO
can accurately capture a high-frequency signal. The goal
of manufacturers is to achieve a flat frequency response.
This response is sometimes referred to as a Maximally
Flat Envelope Delay (MFED). A frequency response of
this type delivers excellent pulse fidelity with minimum
overshoot, undershoot and ringing.

It is important to remember that if the input signal is
not a pure sine wave it will contain a number of higher-
frequency harmonics. For example, a square wave will
contain odd harmonics that have levels that become pro-
gressively reduced as their frequency increases. Thus,
to display a 1 MHz square wave accurately you need
to take into account the fact that there will be signal
components present at 3 MHz, 5 MHz, 7 MHz, 9 MHz,
11 MHz and so on.

Spectrum analysis

The technique of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)
calculated using software algorithms using data cap-
tured by a virtual DSO has made it possible to produce
frequency spectrum displays. Such displays can be used
to investigate the harmonic content of waveforms as
well as the relationship between several signals within
a composite waveform.

Figure 10.27 shows the frequency spectrum of the
1kHz sine wave signal from a low-distortion signal
generator. Here the virtual DSO has been set to capture
samples at a rate of 4096 per second within a frequency
range of d.c. to 12.2kHz. The display clearly shows
the second harmonic (at a level of —50dB or —70dB

relative to the fundamental), plus further harmonics at
3kHz, 5kHz and 7kHz (all of which are greater than
75 dB down on the fundamental).

10.16 Logarithmic ratios

In electronic systems, the ratio of two similar quan-
tities measured at different points in the system are
often expressed in logarithmic units. By definition, if
the ratio of two powers P; and P 2 is to be expressed in
decibel (dB) units, then the number of decibels, X, is
given by:

(from the laws of logarithms).

From equation (1), X decibels is a logarithmic ratio of
two similar quantities and is not an absolute unit of mea-
surement. It is therefore necessary to state a reference
level to measure a number of decibels above or below
that reference. The most widely used reference level for
power is | mW, and when power levels are expressed in
decibels, above or below the 1 mW reference level, the
unit given to the new power level is dBm.

*Who was Bell? Go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

A voltmeter can be re-scaled to indicate the power
level directly in decibels. The scale is generally cali-
brated by taking a reference level of OdB when a power
of 1 mW is dissipated in a 600 Q resistor (this being the
natural impedance of a simple transmission line). The

10.17 Null method of measurement

A null method of measurement is a simple, accurate
and widely used method which depends on an instru-
ment reading being adjusted to read zero current only.
The method assumes:

(i) if there is any deflection at all, then some current
is flowing;

(ii) if there is no deflection, then no current flows (i.e.
a null condition).

Hence it is unnecessary for a meter sensing current
flow to be calibrated when used in this way. A sen-
sitive milliammeter or microammeter with centre-zero
position setting is called a galvanometer. Examples
where the method is used are in the Wheatstone bridge
(see Section 10.18), in the d.c. potentiometer (see
Section 10.19) and with a.c. bridges (see Section 10.20).

10.18 Wheatstone bridge

Figure 10.31 shows a Wheatstone* bridge circuit which
compares an unknown resistance R, with others of
known values, i.e. Rj and R2, which have fixed values,
and R3, which is variable. R3 is varied until zero deflec-
tion is obtained on the galvanometer G. No current then
flows through the meter, V4 = Vz, and the bridge is said
to be ‘balanced’.

R2R3

At balance, Rj R, = RoR3, ie. Ry = ohms

then the current flowing through the galvanometer, G,

There are many forms of a.c. bridge, and these include:
the Maxwell, Hay, Owen and Heaviside bridges for mea-
suring inductance, and the De Sauty, Schering and Wien
bridges for measuring capacitance. A commercial or
universal bridge is one which can be used to measure
resistance, inductance or capacitance.

A.c. bridges require a knowledge of complex num-
bers, as explained in Chapter 23, and such bridges are
discussed in detail in Chapter 27.

10.21 Measurement errors

Errors are always introduced when using instruments to
measure electrical quantities. The errors most likely to
occur in measurements are those due to:

(i) the limitations of the instrument
(ii) the operator
(iii) the instrument disturbing the circuit

(i) Errors in the limitations of the instrument

The calibration accuracy of an instrument
depends on the precision with which it is con-
structed. Every instrument has a margin of error
which is expressed as a percentage of the instru-
ment’s full-scale deflection.

For example, industrial-grade instruments have
an accuracy of +2% of f.s.d. Thus if a voltmeter
has an f.s.d. of 100 V and it indicates 40 V, say,
then the actual voltage may be anywhere between
40+(2% of 100), or 40+2, i.e. between 38 V
and 42 V.

When an instrument is calibrated, it is
compared against a standard instrument and
a graph is drawn of ‘error’ against ‘meter
deflection’.

A typical graph is shown in Figure 10.35
where it is seen that the accuracy varies over
the scale length. Thus a meter with a +2% f.s.d.

accuracy would tend to have an accuracy which
is much better than +2% f.s.d. over much of the
range.

(ii) Errors by the operator

Itis easy for an operator to misread an instrument.
With linear scales the values of the sub-divisions
are reasonably easy to determine; non-linear
scale graduations are more difficult to estimate.
Also, scales differ from instrument to instru-
ment and some meters have more than one
scale (as with multimeters) and mistakes in read-
ing indications are easily made. When reading
a meter scale it should be viewed from an
angle perpendicular to the surface of the scale
at the location of the pointer; a meter scale
should not be viewed ‘at an angle’. Errors by
the operator are largely eliminated using digital
instruments.

(iii) Errors due to the instrument disturbing the
circuit
Any instrument connected into a circuit will affect
that circuit to some extent. Meters require some
power to operate, but provided this power is small
compared with the power in the measured circuit,
then little error will result. Incorrect position-
ing of instruments in a circuit can be a source
of errors. For example, let a resistance be mea-
sured by the voltmeter-ammeter method as shown
in Figure 10.36. Assuming ‘perfect’ instruments,
the resistance should be given by the voltmeter
reading divided by the ammeter reading (i.e.
R=V/I).

Figure 10.36


126 — Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

However, in Figure 10.36(a), V/T=R+rg
and in Figure 10.36(b) the current through the
ammeter is that through the resistor plus that
through the voltmeter. Hence the voltmeter read-
ing divided by the ammeter reading will not give
the true value of the resistance R for either method
of connection.

Problem 19. The current flowing through a
resistor of 5kQ+0.4% is measured as 2.5 mA with
an accuracy of measurement of +0.5%. Determine
the nominal value of the voltage across the resistor
and its accuracy.

Voltage, V = IR = (2.5 x 1073)(5 x 10°) =12.5V.
The maximum possible error is 0.4% + 0.5% = 0.9%

Hence the voltage, V=125V+0.9% of 12.5V
= 0.9/100 x 12.5 =0.1125V =0.11 V correct to 2 sig-
nificant figures. Hence the voltage V may also be
expressed as 12.5+0.11 volts (ic. a voltage lying
between 12.39 V and 12.61 V).

Problem 20. The current / flowing in a resistor R
is measured by a 0-10 A ammeter which gives an
indication of 6.25 A. The voltage V across the
resistor is measured by a 0-50 V voltmeter, which
gives an indication of 36.5 V. Determine the
resistance of the resistor, and its accuracy of
measurement if both instruments have a limit of
error of 2% of f.s.d. Neglect any loading effects of
the instruments.

Maximum relative error = sum of errors = 2.74% +

Hence the resistance of the resistor may be expressed as:
5.842+45.94%, or 5.8440.35 Q (rounding off).

Semiconductor diodes

Why it is important to understand: Semiconductor diodes

Semiconductors have had a monumental impact on our society. Semiconductors are found at the heart of
microprocessor chips as well as transistors. Anything that’s computerized or uses radio waves depends
on semiconductors. Today, most semiconductor chips and transistors are created with silicon; semicon-
ductors are the foundation of modern electronics. Semiconductor-based electronic components include
transistors, solar cells, many kinds of diodes including the light-emitting diode (LED), the silicon con-
trolled rectifier, photo-diodes, and digital and analogue integrated circuits. A diode is the simplest possible
semiconductor device. The ability of the diode to conduct current easily in one direction, but not in the
reverse direction, is very useful. For example, in a car, diodes allow current from the alternator to charge
the battery when the engine is running. However, when the engine stops, the diode prevents the battery
from discharging through the alternator (preventing damage). Diodes are widely used in power supplies
and battery chargers to convert the mains a.c. voltage to a d.c. level (rectifiers). They are also used to
protect elements and systems from excessive voltages or currents, polarity reversals, arcing and shorting.
Diodes are one of the most fundamental devices that are used in electronics. This chapter explains the
operation of the p—n junction, and the characteristics and applications of various types of diode.

11.1 Types of material

Materials may be classified as conductors, semicon-
ductors or insulators. The classification depends on the
value of resistivity of the material. Good conductors are
usually metals and have resistivities in the order of 1077
to 10-8Qm, semiconductors have resistivities in the
order of 1077 to 3 x 10° Qm, and the resistivities of insu-
lators are in the order of 10* to 10!4Qm. Some typical
approximate values at normal room temperatures are:

Conductors

Brass (70 Cu/30 Zn) 8 x10-8§OQm

Steel (mild) 15 x10-8Qm

Semiconductors (at 27°C)

Germanium 0.45 Qm

Insulators

Mica >10!!Qm

Rubber (pure) 10/7 to 10!4Qm

In general, over a limited range of temperatures, the
resistance of a conductor increases with temperature
increase, the resistance of insulators remains approxi-
mately constant with variation of temperature and the
resistance of semiconductor materials decreases as the
temperature increases. For a specimen of each of these
materials, having the same resistance (and thus com-
pletely different dimensions) at, say, 15°C, the variation
for a small increase in temperature to t°C is as shown
in Figure 11.1.

As the temperature of semiconductor materials is
raised above room temperature, the resistivity is reduced
and ultimately a point is reached where they effectively
become conductors. For this reason, silicon should not
operate at a working temperature in excess of 150°C
to 200°C, depending on its purity, and germanium
should not operate at a working temperature in excess

of 75°C to 90°C, depending on its purity. As the tem-
perature of a semiconductor is reduced below normal
room temperature, the resistivity increases until, at
very low temperatures, the semiconductor becomes an
insulator.

11.2 Semiconductor materials

From Chapter 2, it was stated that an atom contains both
negative charge carriers (electrons) and positive charge
carriers (protons). Electrons each carry a single unit
of negative electric charge while protons each exhibit
a single unit of positive charge. Since atoms normally
contain an equal number of electrons and protons, the
net charge present will be zero. For example, if an atom
has 11 electrons, it will also contain 11 protons. The
end result is that the negative charge of the electrons
will be exactly balanced by the positive charge of the
protons.

Electrons are in constant motion as they orbit around
the nucleus of the atom. Electron orbits are organized
into shells. The maximum number of electrons present
in the first shell is two, in the second shell eight, and in
the third, fourth and fifth shells itis 18, 32 and 50, respec-
tively. In electronics, only the electron shell furthermost
from the nucleus of an atom is important. It is important
to note that the movement of electrons between atoms
only involves those present in the outer valence shell.

If the valence shell contains the maximum number
of electrons possible, the electrons are rigidly bonded
together and the material has the properties of an insu-
lator (see Figure 11.2). If, however, the valence shell
does not have its full complement of electrons, the elec-
trons can be easily detached from their orbital bonds,
and the material has the properties associated with an
electrical conductor.

In its pure state, silicon is an insulator because the
covalent bonding rigidly holds all of the electrons,
leaving no free (easily loosened) electrons to conduct
current. If, however, an atom of a different element (i.e.

an impurity) is introduced that has five electrons in
its valence shell, a surplus electron will be present (see
Figure 11.3). These free electrons become available for
use as charge carriers and they can be made to move
through the lattice by applying an external potential
difference to the material.

Similarly, if the impurity element introduced into the
pure silicon lattice has three electrons in its valence
shell, the absence of the fourth electron needed for
proper covalent bonding will produce a number of
spaces into which electrons can fit (see Figure 11.4).
These spaces are referred to as holes. Once again, cur-
rent will flow when an external potential difference is
applied to the material.

Regardless of whether the impurity element produces
surplus electrons or holes, the material will no longer
behave as an insulator, neither will it have the properties

that we normally associate with a metallic conductor.
Instead, we call the material a semiconductor — the
term simply serves to indicate that the material is no
longer a good insulator nor is it a good conductor but
is somewhere in between. Examples of semiconduc-
tor materials include silicon (Si), germanium (Ge),
gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium arsenide (InAs).

Antimony, arsenic and phosphorus are n-type
impurities and form an n-type material when any of
these impurities are added to pure semiconductor mate-
rial such as silicon or germanium. The amount of
impurity added usually varies from | part impurity in 10°
parts semiconductor material to 1 part impurity to 10°
parts semiconductor material, depending on the resis-
tivity required. Indium, aluminium and boron are all
p-type impurities and form a p-type material when any
of these impurities are added to a pure semiconductor.

The process of introducing an atom of another (impu-
rity) element into the lattice of an otherwise pure mate-
rial is called doping. When the pure material is doped
with an impurity with five electrons in its valence shell
(i.e. a pentavalent impurity) it will become an n-type
(i.e. negative type) semiconductor material. If, however,
the pure material is doped with an impurity having three
electrons in its valence shell (1.e. a trivalent impurity) it
will become a p-type (i.e. positive type) semiconductor
material. Note that n-type semiconductor material con-
tains an excess of negative charge carriers, and p-type
material contains an excess of positive charge carriers.

In semiconductor materials, there are very few charge
carriers per unit volume free to conduct. This is
because the ‘four electron structure’ in the outer shell
of the atoms (called valency electrons), form strong
covalent bonds with neighbouring atoms, resulting in

Semiconductor diodes 131

a tetrahedral (i.e. four-sided) structure with the electrons
held fairly rigidly in place.

11.3 Conduction in semiconductor

materials

Arsenic, antimony and phosphorus have five valency
electrons and when a semiconductor is doped with one
of these substances, some impurity atoms are incorpo-
rated in the tetrahedral structure. The ‘fifth’ valency
electron is not rigidly bonded and is free to conduct,
the impurity atom donating a charge carrier.

Indium, aluminium and boron have three valency
electrons, and when a semiconductor is doped with one
of these substances, some of the semiconductor atoms
are replaced by impurity atoms. One of the four bonds
associated with the semiconductor material is deficient
by one electron and this deficiency is called a hole.
Holes give rise to conduction when a potential difference
exists across the semiconductor material due to move-
ment of electrons from one hole to another, as shown in
Figure 11.5. In this diagram, an electron moves from A
to B, giving the appearance that the hole moves from B
to A. Then electron C moves to A, giving the appearance
that the hole moves to C, and so on.

11.4 The p-n junction

which part of the material is p-type and part is n-type.

In order to examine the charge situation, assume that
separate blocks of p-type and n-type materials are pus-
hed together. Also assume that a hole is a positive charge
carrier and that an electron is a negative charge carrier.

At the junction, the donated electrons in the n-type
material, called majority carriers, diffuse into the
p-type material (diffusion is from an area of high den-
sity to an area of lower density) and the acceptor holes
in the p-type material diffuse into the n-type material,
as shown by the arrows in Figure 11.6. Because the
n-type material has lost electrons, it acquires a positive
potential with respect to the p-type material and thus
tends to prevent further movement of electrons. The
p-type material has gained electrons and becomes
negatively charged with respect to the n-type material
and hence tends to retain holes. Thus after a short
while, the movement of electrons and holes stops due
to the potential difference across the junction, called
the contact potential. The area in the region of the
junction becomes depleted of holes and electrons due to
electron-hole recombination, and is called a depletion
layer, as shown in Figure 11.7.

132 — Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

Problem 1. Explain briefly the terms given below
when they are associated with a p—n junction:

(a) conduction in intrinsic semiconductors,

(b) majority and minority carriers, and

(c) diffusion.

(a) Silicon or germanium with no doping atoms added
are called intrinsic semiconductors. At room
temperature, some of the electrons acquire suffi-
cient energy for them to break the covalent bond
between atoms and become free mobile electrons.
This is called thermal generation of electron-
hole pairs. Electrons generated thermally create
a gap in the crystal structure called a hole, the
atom associated with the hole being positively
charged, since it has lost an electron. This positive
charge may attract another electron released from
another atom, creating a hole elsewhere. When
a potential is applied across the semiconductor
material, holes drift towards the negative termi-
nal (unlike charges attract), and electrons towards
the positive terminal, and hence a small current
flows.

(b) When additional mobile electrons are introduced
by doping a semiconductor material with pentava-
lent atoms (atoms having five valency electrons),
these mobile electrons are called majority carri-
ers. The relatively few holes in the n-type material
produced by intrinsic action are called minority
carriers.

For p-type materials, the additional holes are
introduced by doping with trivalent atoms (atoms
having three valency electrons). The holes are
apparently positive mobile charges and are major-
ity carriers in the p-type material. The relatively
few mobile electrons in the p-type material pro-
duced by intrinsic action are called minority
carriers.

(c) Mobile holes and electrons wander freely within
the crystal lattice of a semiconductor material.
There are more free electrons in n-type material
than holes and more holes in p-type material than
electrons. Thus, in their random wanderings, on
average, holes pass into the n-type material and
electrons into the p-type material. This process is
called diffusion.

Problem 2. Explain briefly why a junction
between p-type and n-type materials creates a
contact potential.

Intrinsic semiconductors have resistive properties, in
that when an applied voltage across the material is
reversed in polarity, a current of the same magnitude
flows in the opposite direction. When a p—n junction is
formed, the resistive property is replaced by a rectify-
ing property, that is, current passes more easily in one
direction than the other.

An n-type material can be considered to be a station-
ary crystal matrix of fixed positive charges together with
a number of mobile negative charge carriers (electrons).
The total number of positive and negative charges are
equal. A p-type material can be considered to be a num-
ber of stationary negative charges together with mobile
positive charge carriers (holes).

Again, the total number of positive and negative
charges are equal and the material is neither positively
nor negatively charged. When the materials are brought
together, some of the mobile electrons in the n-type
material diffuse into the p-type material. Also, some
of the mobile holes in the p-type material diffuse into
the n-type material.

Many of the majority carriers in the region of the
junction combine with the opposite carriers to complete
covalent bonds and create a region on either side of
the junction with very few carriers. This region, called
the depletion layer, acts as an insulator and is in the
order of 0.5j1m thick. Since the n-type material has
lost electrons, it becomes positively charged. Also, the
p-type material has lost holes and becomes negatively
charged, creating a potential across the junction, called
the barrier or contact potential.

11.5 Forward and reverse bias

When an external voltage is applied to a p—n junction
making the p-type material positive with respect to the
n-type material, as shown in Figure 11.8, the p—n junc-
tion is forward biased. The applied voltage opposes
the contact potential, and, in effect, closes the depletion
layer. Holes and electrons can now cross the junction
and a current flows. An increase in the applied voltage
above that required to narrow the depletion layer (about
0.2 V for germanium and 0.6 V for silicon), results in a
rapid rise in the current flow.

When an external voltage is applied to a p—n junction
making the p-type material negative with respect to the
n-type material, as shown in Figure 11.9, the p—n junc-
tion is reverse biased. The applied voltage is now in
the same sense as the contact potential and opposes the
movement of holes and electrons due to opening up the

depletion layer. Thus, in theory, no current flows. How-
ever, at normal room temperature certain electrons in
the covalent bond lattice acquire sufficient energy from
the heat available to leave the lattice, generating mobile
electrons and holes. This process is called electron-hole
generation by thermal excitation.

The electrons in the p-type material and holes in
the n-type material caused by thermal excitation are
called minority carriers and these will be attracted by
the applied voltage. Thus, in practice, a small current of
a few microamperes for germanium and less than one
microampere for silicon, at normal room temperature,
flows under reverse bias conditions.

Graphs depicting the current—voltage relationship for
forward and reverse biased p—n junctions, for both
germanium and silicon, are shown in Figure 11.10.

Figure 11.10

A typical characteristic for a silicon p—n junction is
shown in Figure 11.10. When the positive terminal of
the battery is connected to the p-type material and the
negative terminal to the n-type material, the diode is
forward biased. Due to like charges repelling, the holes
in the p-type material drift towards the junction. Simi-
larly, the electrons in the n-type material are repelled
by the negative bias voltage and also drift towards the
junction. The width of the depletion layer and size
of the contact potential are reduced. For applied volt-
ages from 0 to about 0.6 V, very little current flows. At
about 0.6 V, majority carriers begin to cross the junc-
tion in large numbers and current starts to flow. As
the applied voltage is raised above 0.6 V, the current
increases exponentially (see Figure 11.10).

When the negative terminal of the battery is connected
to the p-type material and the positive terminal to the
n-type material the diode is reverse biased. The holes
in the p-type material are attracted towards the nega-
tive terminal and the electrons in the n-type material are
attracted towards the positive terminal (unlike charges
attract). This drift increases the magnitude of both the
contact potential and the thickness of the depletion layer,
so that only very few majority carriers have sufficient
energy to surmount the junction.

The thermally excited minority carriers, however, can
cross the junction since it is, in effect, forward biased for
these carriers. The movement of minority carriers results
in a small constant current flowing. As the magnitude of
the reverse voltage is increased a point will be reached

11.6 Semiconductor diodes

When a junction is formed between p-type and n-type
semiconductor materials, the resulting device is called
a semiconductor diode. This component offers an
extremely low resistance to current flow in one direction
and an extremely high resistance to current flow in
the other. This property allows diodes to be used in
applications that require a circuit to behave differently
according to the direction of current flowing in it. Note
that an ideal diode would pass an infinite current in one
direction and no current at all in the other direction.


136 — Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

A semiconductor diode is an encapsulated p—n jun-
ction fitted with connecting leads or tags for connection
to external circuitry. Where an appreciable current is
present (as is the case with many rectifier circuits) the
diode may be mounted in a metal package designed to
conduct heat away from the junction. The connection to
the p-type material is referred to as the anode while that
to the n-type material is called the cathode.

Various different types of diode are available for dif-
ferent applications. These include rectifier diodes for
use in power supplies, zener diodes for use as voltage
reference sources, light emitting diodes and varactor
diodes. Figure 11.14 shows the symbols used to repre-
sent diodes in electronic circuit diagrams, where ‘a’ is
the anode and ‘k’ the cathode.

11.7 Characteristics and maximum

ratings

Signal diodes require consistent forward characteristics
with low forward voltage drop. Rectifier diodes need
to be able to cope with high values of reverse voltage

and large values of forward current, and consistency of
characteristics is of secondary importance in such appli-
cations. Table 11.1 summarizes the characteristics of
some common semiconductor diodes. It is worth noting
that diodes are limited by the amount of forward cur-
rent and reverse voltage they can withstand. This limit is
based on the physical size and construction of the diode.

A typical general-purpose diode may be specified as
having a forward threshold voltage of 0.6 V and areverse
breakdown voltage of 200 V. If the latter is exceeded,
the diode may suffer irreversible damage. Typical val-
ues of maximum repetitive reverse voltage (Vrrm) or
peak inverse voltage (PIV) range from about 50 V to
over 500 V. The reverse voltage may be increased until
the maximum reverse voltage for which the diode is
rated is reached. If this voltage is exceeded the junction
may break down and the diode may suffer permanent
damage.

11.8 Rectification

The process of obtaining unidirectional currents and
voltages from alternating currents and voltages is called
rectification. Semiconductor diodes are commonly
used to convert alternating current (a.c.) to direct current
(d.c.), in which case they are referred to as rectifiers.
The simplest form of rectifier circuit makes use of a sin-
gle diode and, since it operates on only either positive
or negative halfcycles of the supply, it is known as a
half-wave rectifier. Four diodes are connected as a
bridge rectifier — see Figure 11.14(d) — and are often
used as a full-wave rectifier. Note that in both cases,
automatic switching of the current is carried out by
the diode(s). For methods of half-wave and full-wave
rectification, see Section 14.8, page 199.

11.9 Zener diodes

Zener diodes are heavily doped silicon diodes that,
unlike normal diodes, exhibit an abrupt reverse break-
down at relatively low voltages (typically less than 6 V).
A similar effect, called avalanche breakdown, occurs
in less heavily doped diodes. These avalanche diodes
also exhibit a rapid breakdown with negligible current
flowing below the avalanche voltage and a relatively
large current flowing once the avalanche voltage has
been reached. For avalanche diodes, this breakdown
voltage usually occurs at voltages above 6 V. In prac-
tice, however, both types of diode are referred to as

4 Whereas reverse breakdown is a highly undesir-
able effect in circuits that use conventional diodes,
it can be extremely useful in the case of Zener
diodes where the breakdown voltage is precisely
known. When a diode is undergoing reverse break-
down and provided its maximum ratings are not
exceeded, the voltage appearing across it will remain
substantially constant (equal to the nominal Zener volt-
l age) regardless of the current flowing. This property
ccward stage. makes the Zener diode ideal for use as a voltage
(V) regulator.

11.10 Silicon controlled rectifiers

Silicon controlled rectifiers (or thyristors) are three-
terminal devices which can be used for switching and a.c.
power control. Silicon controlled rectifiers can switch
very rapidly from conducting to a non-conducting state.
In the off state, the silicon controlled rectifier exhibits
negligible leakage current, while in the on state the device
exhibits very low resistance. This results in very little
power loss within the silicon controlled rectifier even
when appreciable power levels are being controlled.

Once switched into the conducting state, the sili-
con controlled rectifier will remain conducting (i.e. it
is latched in the on state) until the forward current
is removed from the device. In d.c. applications this
necessitates the interruption (or disconnection) of the
supply before the device can be reset into its non-
conducting state. Where the device is used with an
alternating supply, the device will automatically become
reset whenever the main supply reverses. The device can
then be triggered on the next half cycle having correct
polarity to permit conduction.

Like their conventional silicon diode counterparts,
silicon controlled rectifiers have anode and cathode
connections; control is applied by means of a gate ter-
minal, g. The symbol for a silicon controlled rectifier is
shown in Figure 11.14(c).

In normal use, a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) is
triggered into the conducting (on) state by means of the
application of a current pulse to the gate terminal — see
Figure 11.17. The effective triggering of a silicon con-
trolled rectifier requires a gate trigger pulse having a fast
rise time derived from a low-resistance source. Trigger-
ing can become erratic when insufficient gate current
is available or when the gate current changes slowly.

11.11 Light emitting diodes

Light emitting diodes (LED) can be used as general-
purpose indicators and, compared with conventional
filament lamps, operate from significantly smaller volt-
ages and currents. LEDs are also very much more
reliable than filament lamps. Most LEDs will provide a
reasonable level of light output when a forward current
of between 5 mA and 20 mA is applied.

LEDs are available in various formats, with the round
types being most popular. Round LEDs are commonly

Semiconductor diodes 139

available in the 3mm and 5mm (0.2 inch) diameter
plastic packages and also in a 5mm x 2mm rectangu-
lar format. The viewing angle for round LEDs tends
to be in the region of 20° to 40°, whereas for rect-
angular types this is increased to around 100°. The
peak wavelength of emission depends on the type of
semiconductor employed, but usually lies in the range
630 to 690nm. The symbol for an LED is shown in
Figure 11.14(f).

11.12 Varactor diodes

It was shown earlier that when a diode is operated in
the reverse biased condition, the width of the depletion
region increases as the applied voltage increases. Vary-
ing the width of the depletion region is equivalent to
varying the plate separation of a very small capacitor
such that the relationship between junction capacitance
and applied reverse voltage will look something like
that shown in Figure 11.18. The typical variation of
capacitance provided by a varactor is from about 50 pF
to 1OpF as the reverse voltage is increased from 2 V
to 20 V. The symbol for a varactor diode is shown in
Figure 11.14(h).

The conventional p—n junction diode explained in
Section 11.4 operates well as a rectifier and switch-
ing device at relatively low frequencies (i.e. 50 Hz to
400Hz) but its performance as a rectifier becomes
seriously impaired at high frequencies due to the
presence of stored charge carriers in the junction. These
have the effect of momentarily allowing current to flow
in the reverse direction when reverse voltage is applied.
This problem becomes increasingly more problematic

as the frequency of the a.c. supply is increased and the
periodic time of the applied voltage becomes smaller.

To avoid these problems a diode that uses a metal—
semiconductor contact rather than a p—n junction (see
Figure 11.19) is employed. When compared with con-
ventional silicon junction diodes, these Schottky*
diodes have a lower forward voltage (typically 0.35 V)
and a slightly reduced maximum reverse voltage rat-
ing (typically 50V to 200V). Their main advantage,
however, is that they operate with high efficiency in
switched-mode power supplies (SMPS) at frequencies
of up to 1 MHz. Schottky diodes are also extensively
used in the construction of integrated circuits designed
for high-speed digital logic applications.

Transistors

The invention of the bipolar transistor in 1948 started a revolution in electronics. Technical feats previously
requiring relatively large, mechanically fragile, power-hungry vacuum tubes were suddenly achievable
with tiny, mechanically rugged, power-thrifty specks of crystalline silicon. This revolution made possible
the design and manufacture of lightweight, inexpensive electronic devices that we now take for granted.
Understanding how transistors function is of paramount importance to anyone interested in understand-
ing modern electronics. A transistor is a three-terminal semiconductor device that can perform two
functions that are fundamental to the design of electronic circuits — amplification and switching. Put
simply, amplification consists of magnifying a signal by transferring energy to it from an external source,
whereas a transistor switch is a device for controlling a relatively large current between or voltage across
two terminals by means of a small control current or voltage applied at a third terminal. Transistors can
be mass produced at very low costs, and transistors are the reason that computers keep getting smaller
yet more powerful every day. There are more than 60 million transistors built every year for every man,
woman and child on Earth. Transistors are the key to our modern world. This chapter explains the
structure and operation of the transistor, incorporating some simple calculations.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

e understand the structure of bipolar junction transistors (BJT) and junction gate field effect transistors (JFET)
e understand the action of BJT and JFET devices

e appreciate different classes and applications for BJT and JFET devices

12.1 Transistor classification

Transistors fall into two main classes — bipolar and
field effect. They are also classified according to semi-
conductor material employed — silicon or germanium,
and to their field of application (for example, general
purpose, switching, high frequency, and so on). Tran-
sistors are also classified according to the application
that they are designed for, as shown in Table 12.1.
Note that these classifications can be combined so that
it is possible, for example, to classify a transistor as
a ‘low-frequency power transistor’ or as a ‘low-noise
high-frequency transistor’.

12.2 Bipolar junction

transistors (BJTs)

Bipolar transistors generally comprise n—p—n or p—n—p
junctions of either silicon (Si) or germanium (Ge)
material. The junctions are, in fact, produced in a sin-
gle slice of silicon by diffusing impurities through a
photographically reduced mask. Silicon transistors are
superior when compared with germanium transistors in
the vast majority of applications (particularly at high
temperatures) and thus germanium devices are very
rarely encountered in modern electronic equipment.
The construction of typical n—p—n and p—n-p tran-
sistors is shown in Figures 12.1 and 12.2. In order to
conduct the heat away from the junction (important in
medium- and high-power applications) the collector is
connected to the metal case of the transistor.

n—p-n and p-n-p transistors are shown in Figure 12.3.
It is important to note that the base region (p-type mate-
rial in the case of an n—p-n transistor or n-type material
in the case of a p—n-p transistor) is extremely narrow.

12.3 Transistor action

In the n-p-—n transistor, connected as shown in
Figure 12.4(a), transistor action is accounted for as
follows:

(a)

(b)

(e)

the majority carriers in the n-type emitter material
are electrons

the base-emitter junction is forward biased to these
majority carriers and electrons cross the junction
and appear in the base region

the base region is very thin and only lightly doped
with holes, so some recombination with holes
occurs but many electrons are left in the base region

the base—collector junction is reverse biased to
holes in the base region and electrons in the col-
lector region, but is forward biased to electrons in
the base region; these electrons are attracted by the
positive potential at the collector terminal

a large proportion of the electrons in the base
region cross the base collector junction into the
collector region, creating a collector current.

The transistor action for an n—p—n device is shown
diagrammatically in Figure 12.5(a). Conventional cur-
rent flow is taken to be in the direction of the motion of
holes, that is, in the opposite direction to electron flow.
Around 99.5% of the electrons leaving the emitter will

(c) the base region is very thin and is only lightly

hole pairs are formed, many holes are left in the
base region

(d) the base—collector junction is reverse biased to
electrons in the base region and holes in the collec-
tor region, but forward biased to holes in the base
region; these holes are attracted by the negative
potential at the collector terminal

(e) a large proportion of the holes in the base region
cross the base—collector junction into the collector
region, creating a collector current; conventional
current flow is in the direction of hole movement.

The transistor action for a p—n—p device is shown dia-
grammatically in Figure 12.5(b). Around 99.5% of the
holes leaving the emitter will cross the base—collector
junction and only 0.5% of the holes will recombine with
electrons in the narrow base region.

12.4 Leakage current

For an n—-p-n transistor, the base—collector junction
is reversed biased for majority carriers, but a small
leakage current, Icgo, flows from the collector to the
base due to thermally generated minority carriers (holes
in the collector and electrons in the base) being present.
The base—collector junction is forward biased to these
minority carriers.

Similarly, for a p-n-p transistor, the base—collector
junction is reverse biased for majority carriers. How-
ever, a small leakage current, Jcgo, flows from the base
to the collector due to thermally generated minority car-
riers (electrons in the collector and holes in the base),
being present. Once again, the base—collector junction
is forward biased to these minority carriers.

With modern transistors, leakage current is usually
very small (typically less than 100nA) and in most
applications it can be ignored.

Problem 1. With reference to a p—n-p transistor,
explain briefly what is meant by the term ‘transistor
action’ and why a bipolar junction transistor is so
named.

For the transistor as depicted in Figure 12.4(b), the
emitter is relatively heavily doped with acceptor atoms
(holes). When the emitter terminal is made sufficiently
positive with respect to the base, the base-emitter junc-
tion is forward biased to the majority carriers. The
majority carriers are holes in the emitter and these drift
from the emitter to the base.

The base region is relatively lightly doped with
donor atoms (electrons) and although some electron—
hole recombinations take place, perhaps 0.5%, most
of the holes entering the base do not combine with
electrons.

The base—collector junction is reverse biased to elec-
trons in the base region, but forward biased to holes in
the base region. Since the base is very thin and now
is packed with holes, these holes pass the base-emitter
junction towards the negative potential of the collector
terminal. The control of current from emitter to collector
is largely independent of the collector—base voltage and
almost wholly governed by the emitter—base voltage.

The essence of transistor action is this current con-
trol by means of the base-emitter voltage. In a p—n—p
transistor, holes in the emitter and collector regions are
majority carriers, but are minority carriers when in the
base region. Also thermally generated electrons in the
emitter and collector regions are minority carriers as
are holes in the base region. However, both majority
and minority carriers contribute towards the total cur-
rent flow (see Figure 12.6). It is because a transistor

Transistors 145

makes use of both types of charge carriers (holes and
electrons) that they are called bipolar. The transistor
also comprises two p—n junctions and for this reason
it is a junction transistor; hence the name — bipolar
junction transistor.

12.5 Bias and current flow

In normal operation (i.e. for operation as a linear ampli-
fier) the base-emitter junction of a transistor is forward
biased and the collector—base junction is reverse biased.
The base region is, however, made very narrow so that
catriers are swept across it from emitter to collector so
that only a relatively small current flows in the base. To
put this into context, the current flowing in the emitter
circuit is typically 100 times greater than that flowing
in the base. The direction of conventional current flow
is from emitter to collector in the case of a p—n—p tran-
sistor, and collector to emitter in the case of an n—p—n
device, as shown in Figure 12.7.

The equation that relates current flow in the collector,
base, and emitter circuits (see Figure 12.7) is:

Ig=Ig+Ic

where J/g is the emitter current, /gp is the base current
and Jc is the collector current (all expressed in the same
units).

(b) p—n-p bipolar junction transistor (BUT)

Problem 2. A transistor operates with a collector
current of 100mA and an emitter current of
102 mA. Determine the value of base current.

Emitter current, J; = /p + Ic

from which, base current, Jp = Jp — Ic
Hence, base current, Jp = 102 —100=2mA

configurations

Three basic circuit configurations are used for transis-
tor amplifiers. These three circuit configurations depend
upon which one of the three transistor connections is
made common to both the input and the output. In the
case of bipolar junction transistors, the configurations
are known as common emitter, common collector
(or emitter follower) and common base, as shown in
Figure 12.8.

12.7 Bipolar transistor characteristics

The characteristics of a bipolar junction transistor are
usually presented in the form of a set of graphs relating
voltage and current present at the transistor terminals.
Figure 12.9 shows a typical input characteristic (/p
plotted against Vgp) for an n—p-n bipolar junction tran-
sistor operating in common-emitter mode. In this mode,
the input current is applied to the base and the output
current appears in the collector (the emitter is effectively

common to both the input and output circuits, as shown
in Figure 12.8(a)).

The input characteristic shows that very little base
current flows until the base-emitter voltage Vgz exceeds
0.6 V. Thereafter, the base current increases rapidly —
this characteristic bears a close resemblance to the
forward part of the characteristic for a silicon diode.

Figure 12.10 shows a typical set of output (collector)
characteristics (/c plotted against Vcg) for an n—p—n
bipolar transistor. Each curve corresponds to a different

tic below Vcg =2 V. Also note that the curves are quite
flat. For this reason (i.e. since the collector current does
not change very much as the collector—emitter voltage
changes) we often refer to this as a constant current
characteristic.

Figure 12.11 shows a typical transfer characteris-
tic for an n—p-n bipolar junction transistor. Here Jc is
plotted against Jp for a small-signal general-purpose
transistor. The slope of this curve (i.e. the ratio of Jc to
Ig) is the common-emitter current gain of the transistor
which is explored further in Section 12.9.

A circuit that can be used for obtaining the common-
emitter characteristics of an n—p-n BJT is shown in
Figure 12.12. For the input characteristic, VR1 is set
at a particular value and the corresponding values of
Vee and Jp are noted. This is repeated for various set-
tings of VR1 and plotting the values gives the typical
input characteristic of Figure 12.9.

For the output characteristics, VR1 is varied so that
Tp is, say, 20 1A. Then VR2 is set at various values and
corresponding values of Vcg and Jc are noted. The graph
of Vog/Ic is then plotted for Iz = 20 WA. This is repeated
for, say, Ip =40WA, Jpg =60\LA and so on. Plotting
the values gives the typical output characteristics of
Figure 12.10.

12.8 Transistor parameters

The transistor characteristics met in the previous section
provide us with some useful information that can help us
to model the behaviour of a transistor. In particular, the
three characteristic graphs can be used to determine the
following parameters for operation in common-emitter
mode:

The method for determining these parameters from
the relevant characteristic is illustrated in the following
worked problems.

characteristic for an n—p—n silicon transistor. When
the base-emitter voltage is 0.65 V, determine (a) the
value of base current, (b) the static value of input
resistance and (c) the dynamic value of input

12.9 Current gain

As stated earlier, the common-emitter current gain is
given by the ratio of collector current, Jc, to base current,
Ig. We use the symbol /gg to represent the static value
of common-emitter current gain, thus:

96

Similarly, we use hfe to represent the dynamic value of
common-emitter current gain, thus:

As we showed earlier, values of hpg and he can be
obtained from the transfer characteristic (ic plotted
against Jp). Note that pp is found from corresponding
static values while fe is found by measuring the slope
of the graph. Also note that, if the transfer characteristic
is linear, there is little Gf any) difference between hrE
and hfe.

It is worth noting that current gain (hfe) varies with
collector current. For most small-signal transistors, hfe
is a maximum at a collector current in the range | mA
and 10mA. Current gain also falls to very low values
for power transistors when operating at very high val-
ues of collector current. Furthermore, most transistor
parameters (particularly common-emitter current gain,
hfe) are liable to wide variation from one device to the
next. It is, therefore, important to design circuits on the
basis of the minimum value for /ye in order to ensure
successful operation with a variety of different devices.

common-emitter current gain of 125. If the
transistor operates with a collector current of

12.11 Field effect transistors

Field effect transistors are available in two basic forms;
junction gate and insulated gate. The gate source junc-
tion of a junction gate field effect transistor (JFET)
is effectively a reverse-biased p—n junction. The gate
connection of an insulated gate field effect transis-
tor (IGFET), on the other hand, is insulated from the
channel and charge is capacitively coupled to the chan-
nel. To keep things simple, we will consider only JFET
devices. Figure 12.16 shows the basic construction of
an n-channel JFET.

Low-frequency power

JFET transistors comprise a channel of p-type or
n-type material surrounded by material of the opposite
polarity. The ends of the channel (in which conduction
takes place) form electrodes known as the source and
drain. The effective width of the channel (in which con-
duction takes place) is controlled by a charge placed
on the third (gate) electrode. The effective resistance
between the source and drain is thus determined by the
voltage present at the gate. (The + signs in Figure 12.16
are used to indicate a region of heavy doping thus nt
simply indicates a heavily doped n-type region.)

JFETs offer a very much higher input resistance
when compared with bipolar transistors. For example,
the input resistance of a bipolar transistor operating
in common-emitter mode is usually around 2.5kQ.
A JFET transistor operating in equivalent common-
source mode would typically exhibit an input resistance
of 100 MQ! This feature makes JFET devices ideal for
use in applications where a very high input resistance is
desirable.

As with bipolar transistors, the characteristics of a
FET are often presented in the form of a set of graphs
relating voltage and current present at the transistor’s
terminals.

A typical mutual characteristic (Jp plotted against
Vas) for a small-signal general-purpose n-channel field
effect transistor operating in common-source mode is
shown in Figure 12.17. This characteristic shows that

the drain current is progressively reduced as the gate—
source voltage is made more negative. At a certain value
of Vos the drain current falls to zero and the device is
said to be cut-off.

Figure 12.18 shows a typical family of output char-
acteristics (/p plotted against Vps) for a small-signal
general-purpose n-channel FET operating in common-
source mode. This characteristic comprises a family of
curves, each relating to a different value of gate-source
voltage Vgs. You might also like to compare this char-
acteristic with the output characteristic for a transistor
operating in common-emitter mode that you met earlier
in Figure 12.10.

As in the case of the bipolar junction transistor, the
output characteristic curves for an n-channel FET have
a ‘knee’ that occurs at low values of Vps. Also, note
how the curves become flattened above this value with
the drain current Jp not changing very significantly
for a comparatively large change in drain—source volt-
age Vps. These characteristics are, in fact, even flatter
than those for a bipolar transistor. Because of their flat-
ness, they are often said to represent a constant current
characteristic.

The gain offered by a field effect transistor is normally
expressed in terms of its forward transconductance
(gts or Ys) in common-source mode. In this mode, the
input voltage is applied to the gate and the output current
appears in the drain (the source is effectively common
to both the input and output circuits).

In common-source mode, the static (or d.c.) forward
transfer conductance is given by:

I;

8ts = wT (from corresponding points on the graph)
GS

whilst the dynamic (or a.c.) forward transfer

conductance is given by:

8ts = Alp (from the slope of the graph)
AVocs
(Note that A/p means ‘change of Jp’ and A Ves means
‘change of Vgs’.)
The method for determining these parameters from the
relevant characteristic is illustrated in worked Problem
8 below.
Forward transfer conductance (gf;) varies with drain
current. For most small-signal devices, g¢s, is quoted for
values of drain current between | mA and 10mA. Most
FET parameters (particularly forward transfer conduc-
tance) are liable to wide variation from one device to
the next. It is, therefore, important to design circuits
on the basis of the minimum value for ggs, in order
to ensure successful operation with a variety of differ-
ent devices. The experimental circuit for obtaining the
common-source characteristics of an n-channel JFET
transistor is shown in Figure 12.19.

12.14 Transistor amplifiers

Three basic circuit arrangements are used for transistor
amplifiers and these are based on the three circuit config-
urations that we met earlier (i.e. they depend upon which
one of the three transistor connections is made common
to both the input and the output). In the case of bipolar
transistors, the configurations are known as common
emitter, common collector (or emitter follower) and
common base.

Where field effect transistors are used, the corre-
sponding configurations are common source, common
drain (or source follower) and common gate.

These basic circuit configurations, depicted in
Figures 12.21 and 12.22, exhibit quite different perfor-
mance characteristics, as shown in Tables 12.4 and 12.5,
respectively.

A requirement of most amplifiers is that the output
signal should be a faithful copy of the input signal or be

somewhat larger in amplitude. Other types of amplifier
are ‘non-linear’, in which case their input and output
waveforms will not necessarily be similar. In practice,
the degree of linearity provided by an amplifier can be
affected by a number of factors, including the amount of
bias applied and the amplitude of the input signal. It is
also worth noting that a linear amplifier will become
non-linear when the applied input signal exceeds a
threshold value. Beyond this value the amplifier is said
to be overdriven and the output will become increasingly
distorted if the input signal is further increased.

The optimum value of bias for linear (Class A)
amplifiers is that value which ensures that the
active devices are operated at the mid-point of their

characteristics. In practice, this means that a static value
of collector current will flow even when there is no sig-
nal present. Furthermore, the collector current will flow
throughout the complete cycle of an input signal (i.e.
conduction will take place over an angle of 360°). At
no stage should the transistor be saturated (VcE ~0V
or Vps ¥ OV) nor should it be cut-off (Vcg © Vcc or
Vps © Vpp).

In order to ensure that a static value of collector cur-
rent flows in a transistor, a small current must be applied
to the base of the transistor. This current can be derived
from the same voltage rail that supplies the collector
circuit (via the collector load). Figure 12.23 shows a
simple Class-A common-emitter circuit in which the

Simple Class-A amplifier

Figure 12.23

base bias resistor, R1, and collector load resistor, R2,
are connected to a common positive supply rail.

The a.c. signal is applied to the base terminal of the
transistor via a coupling capacitor, Cl. This capacitor
removes the d.c. component of any signal applied to the
input terminals and ensures that the base bias current
delivered by R1 is unaffected by any device connected
to the input. C2 couples the signal out of the stage and
also prevents d.c. current flow appearing at the output
terminals.

12.15 Load lines

The a.c. performance of a transistor amplifier stage can
be predicted using a load line superimposed on the rele-
vant set of output characteristics. For a bipolar transistor
operating in common-emitter mode the required charac-
teristics are Jc plotted against Vcg. One end of the load
line corresponds to the supply voltage (Vcc) while the
other end corresponds to the value of collector or drain
current that would flow with the device totally saturated
(Vcz =0V). In this condition:

Vi
Io = MEE
Ri

where Ry, is the value of collector or drain load
resistance.

Figure 12.24 shows a load line superimposed on a set
of output characteristics for a bipolar transistor oper-
ating in common-emitter mode. The quiescent point
(or operating point) is the point on the load line that
corresponds to the conditions that exist when no sig-
nal is applied to the stage. In Figure 12.24, the base
bias current is set at 201A so that the quiescent point
effectively sits roughly halfway along the load line.
This position ensures that the collector voltage can

swing both positively (above) and negatively (below)
its quiescent value (Vcq).

The effect of superimposing an alternating base cur-
rent (of 201A peak—peak) to the d.c. bias current (of
20 wA) can be clearly seen. The corresponding collector
current signal can be determined by simply moving up
and down the load line.

Problem 11. The characteristic curves shown in
Figure 12.25 relate to a transistor operating in
common-emitter mode. If the transistor is operated
with Jp =30A, a load resistor of 1.2 kQ and an
18 V supply, determine (a) the quiescent values of
collector voltage and current (Vcg and Jcq), and
(b) the peak—peak output voltage that would be
produced by an input signal of 40 wA peak—peak.

Chapter 13

D.c. circuit theory

Why it is important to understand: D.c circuit theory

In earlier chapters it was seen that a single equivalent resistance can be found when two or more resistors
are connected together in either series, parallel or combinations of both, and that these circuits obey
Ohm’s law. However, sometimes in more complex circuits we cannot simply use Ohm’s law alone to find
the voltages or currents circulating within the circuit. For these types of calculations we need certain rules
which allow us to obtain the circuit equations and for this we can use Kirchhoff’s laws. In addition, there
are a number of circuit theorems — superposition theorem, Thévenin’s theorem, Norton’s theorem — which
allow us to analyse more complex circuits. In addition, the maximum power transfer theorem enables us
to determine maximum power in a d.c. circuit. In this chapter Kirchhoff’s laws and the circuit theorems
are explained in detail using many numerical worked examples. An electrical/electronic engineer often
needs to be able to analyse an electrical network to determine currents flowing in each branch and the
voltage across each branch.

; following). In addition, there are a number of circuit
13.1 Introduction theorems which have been developed for solving prob-

lems in electrical networks. These include:

The laws which determine the currents and voltage

drops in d.c. networks are: (a) Ohm’s law (see Chapter (i) the superposition theorem (see Section 13.3),
2), (b) the laws for resistors in series and in parallel (see (ii) Thévenin’s theorem (see Section 13.5),
Chapter 5) and (c) Kirchhoff’s laws (see Section 13.2 (iii) Norton’s theorem (see Section 13.7) and

(iv) the maximum power transfer theorem (see
Section 13.9).

Kirchhoff’s* laws state:

(a) Current Law. Af any junction in an electric circuit
the total current flowing towards that junction is
equal to the total current flowing away from the
junction, i.e. UI =0
Thus, referring to Figure 13.1:
h+h=h+4+1s5 or

Khth-h-k-Ilk=0

Figure 13.1

(b) Voltage Law. /n any closed loop in a network, the
algebraic sum of the voltage drops (i.e. products
of current and resistance) taken around the loop is
equal to the resultant e.m.f. acting in that loop.

Thus, referring to Figure 13.2:
E, — Ex =I1R, + IR2.+IR3

(Note that if current flows away from the positive
terminal of a source, that source is considered by
convention to be positive. Thus moving anticlock-
wise around the loop of Figure 13.2, E1 is positive
and E> is negative.)

(a) Applying Kirchhoff’s current law:
For junction B: 50=20+/,. Hence 11 =30A
For junctionC: 20+15=h. Hence I2= 35A
For junction D: [;=4+120
ie. 30=1,4120. Hence l3=—90A

(i.e. in the opposite direction to that shown in
Figure 13.3(a).)

For junction E: 44+48=15
ie. I4=15—(—90).
Hence 14=105A
For junction F: 120=/5 +40. Hence Is =80A

Hence E=14-5=9V

Problem 2. Use Kirchhoff’s laws to determine
the currents flowing in each branch of the network
shown in Figure 13.4.

Figure 13.4

Procedure

1.

Use Kirchhoff’s current law and label current direc-
tions on the original circuit diagram. The directions
chosen are arbitrary, but it is usual, as a starting
point, to assume that current flows from the posi-
tive terminals of the batteries. This is shown in
Figure 13.5, where the three branch currents are
expressed in terms of J; and J) only, since the
current through R is 1; +h

Figure 13.5

Divide the circuit into two loops and apply Kirch-
hoff’s voltage law to each. From loop 1 of
Figure 13.5, and moving in a clockwise direction
as indicated (the direction chosen does not matter),
gives
Ey=hrt+(h+h)R, ie.4=2h +4 +h)
ie. 61) +4h =4 (1)
From loop 2 of Figure 13.5, and moving in an anti-
clockwise direction as indicated (once again, the
choice of direction does not matter; it does not have
to be in the same direction as that chosen for the first
loop), gives:
Fo=hrrat+(h+h)R, ie. 2=h+4h4+ bh)
ie.44,+5hb =2 (2)
Solve equations (1) and (2) for J; and Jy
2x (1) gives: 124, 4+8h=8 (3)
3 x (2) gives: 124, +15h =6 (4)

2
(3)-(4) gives: —71p =2 hence Ih = —3

= —0.286A
(i.e. Jy is flowing in the opposite direction to that
shown in Figure 13.5.)

From (1) 6/; + 4(—0.286)=4
67, =44+1.144

5.144
Hence = a =0.857 A

D.c. circuit theory 167

Current flowing through resistance R is
Ty + Iz = 0.857 + (—0.286) = 0.571 A

Note that a third loop is possible, as shown in
Figure 13.6, giving a third equation which can be
used as a check:

each branch current for the network shown in
Figure 13.7.

Ey=4V

Currents and their directions are shown labelled in
Figure 13.8 following Kirchhoff’s current law. It is

2. The network is divided into two loops as shown
in Figure 13.8. Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law
gives:

For loop 1:
FE, + £2=NR}+hR2
1.e. 16=0.544+2h (1)

For loop 2:
Ey =1R2-( — 1) R3

Note that since loop 2 is in the opposite direction

to current (J; — Jy), the volt drop across R3 (i.e.

(1; — In)(R3)) is by convention negative.

Thus 12 = 2b —5( — Ih)

Le. 12=-5h,+7h (2)
3. Solving equations (1) and (2) to find 4; and hh:

10 x (1) gives 160 = 57, + 20/2 (3)

(2) + (3) gives 172 = 27J5 hence Ih = a

Let the current in the 2. resistor be /,, then by Kirch-
hoff’s current law, the current in the 14Q resistor is
(J—1,). Let the current in the 32Q resistor be 1
as shown in Figure 13.10. Then the current in the
11Q resistor is (J; —J2) and that in the 3Q resistor
is (I—1,;+ 2). Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to

However I=8A
Hence 0=27,4+32h —14(8—-h)
i.e. 161, +32h =112 (2)

Equations (1) and (2) are simultaneous equations with
two unknowns, J; and Jy.

16 x (1) gives: 2081; — 1761, = 864 (3)
13 x (2) gives: 2087, +416h = 1456 (4)
(4) — (8) gives: 592 Ip = 592

hh=1A

Substituting for Jy in (1) gives:

13.3 The superposition theorem

The superposition theorem states:

‘In any network made up of linear resistances and con-
taining more than one source of e.m.f., the resultant
current flowing in any branch is the algebraic sum of
the currents that would flow in that branch if each
source was considered separately, all other sources
being replaced at that time by their respective internal
resistances.’

The following points involving d.c. circuit analysis
need to be appreciated before proceeding with problems
using Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems:

(i) The open-circuit voltage, E, across terminals

no voltage drop occurs.

For the circuit shown in Figure 13.30(a), the 3 Q

If the 10 V battery in Figure 13.30(a) is removed
and replaced by a short-circuit, as shown in
Figure 13.30(c), then the 20 resistor may be
removed. The reason for this is that a short-
circuit has zero resistance, and 20Q in paral-
lel with zero ohms gives an equivalent resis-
tance of: (20 x 0/20+0), i.e. 0Q. The circuit
is then as shown in Figure 13.30(d), which is
redrawn in Figure 13.30(e).

(ix) In the worked problems in Sections 13.5 and
13.7 following, it may be considered that
Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems have no obvi-
ous advantages compared with, say, Kirchhoff’s
laws. However, these theorems can be used to
analyse part of a circuit, and in much more
complicated networks the principle of replac-
ing the supply by a constant voltage source in
series with a resistance (or impedance) is very
useful.

13.5 Thévenin’s theorem

Thévenin’s* theorem states:

‘The current in any branch of a network is that which
would result if an e.m.f. equal to the p.d. across a break
made in the branch, were introduced into the branch,
all other e.mf.s being removed and represented by the
internal resistances of the sources.’

The procedure adopted when using Thévenin’s theorem
is summarized below. To determine the current in any
branch of an active network (i.e. one containing a source
of e.m.f.):

(i) remove the resistance R from that branch,
(ii) determine the open-circuit voltage, E,, across the
break,
(iii) remove each source of e.m.f. and replace them
by their internal resistances and then determine
the resistance, 7, ‘looking-in’ at the break,

Hence the p.d. between A and B

=44.47 —8.31= 36.16 V

Point C is at a potential of +54 V. Between C and
A is a voltage drop of 8.31 V. Hence the voltage at
point A is 54—8.31=45.69 V. Between C and B
is a voltage drop of 44.47 V. Hence the voltage at
point B is 54—44.47=9.53 V. Since the voltage
at A is greater than at B, current must flow in the
direction A to B (see Section 13.4 (vii)).

Replacing the source of e.m.f. with a short-circuit
(i.e. zero internal resistance) gives the circuit
shown in Figure 13.38(c). The circuit is redrawn

13.6 Constant-current source

A source of electrical energy can be represented by
a source of e.m.f. in series with a resistance. In
Section 13.5, the Thévenin constant-voltage source con-
sisted of a constant e.m.f. E in series with an internal
resistance r. However, this is not the only form of rep-
resentation. A source of electrical energy can also be
represented by a constant-current source in parallel with
a resistance. It may be shown that the two forms are
equivalent. An ideal constant-voltage generator is one
with zero internal resistance so that it supplies the same
voltage to all loads. An ideal constant-current gen-
erator is one with infinite internal resistance so that it
supplies the same current to all loads.

Note the symbol for an ideal current source (from BS EN
60617-2: 1996, which superseded BS 3939-2: 1985),
shown in Figure 13.43.

short-circuit current of which is equal to the current that
would flow in a short-circuit across the branch, and
the internal resistance of which is equal to the resist-
ance which appears across the open-circuited branch
terminals.’

The procedure adopted when using Norton’s theorem is
summarized below.

To determine the current flowing in a resistance R of a
branch AB of an active network:

(i) short-circuit branch AB

(ii) determine the short-circuit current sc flowing in
the branch
(iii) remove all sources of e.m.f. and replace them | 20

source exists, replace with an open-circuit), then
determine the resistance 7, ‘looking-in’ at a break

The open-circuit voltage E across terminals AB in

E = Usc) (r) = (4) 3) =12V.

The resistance ‘looking-in’ at terminals AB is 3Q.

Hence the equivalent Thévenin circuit is as shown in

Problem 18. (a) Convert the circuit to the left of
terminals AB in Figure 13.56(a) to an equivalent
Thévenin circuit by initially converting to a Norton
equivalent circuit. (b) Determine the current
flowing in the 1.8 © resistor.

(a) For the branch containing the 12 V source, con-
verting to a Norton equivalent circuit gives
Isc =12/3=4A andr; =3 Q. For the branch con-
taining the 24V source, converting to a Norton
equivalent circuit gives I[sc2=24/2=12A and
72 =2Q.
Thus Figure 13.56(b) shows a network equivalent
to Figure 13.56(a).

From Figure 13.56(b) the total short-circuit current
is4+ 12=16A and the total resistance is given by:

Thus Figure 13.56(b) simplifies to Figure 13.56(c).

The open-circuit voltage across AB of Figure

For the branch containing the 6 V source, converting to

Combining the 5mA and 2mA current sources gives
the equivalent network of Figure 13.57(c), where the

Both of the Norton equivalent networks shown in

is: (7x 1074)(1.2 x 10°?)=8.4V and the resistance
‘looking-in’ at CD is 1.2kQ.

The open-circuit voltage across EF is (1 x 10~)(600)
=0.6 V and the resistance ‘looking-in’ at EF is 0.6kQ.
Thus Figure 13.57(c) converts to Figure 13.57(d). Com-
bining the two Thévenin circuits gives

E=8.4—0.6=7.8 V and the resistance

13.9 Maximum power transfer
theorem

The maximum power transfer theorem states:

‘The power transferred from a supply source to a load is
at its maximum when the resistance of the load is equal
to the internal resistance of the source.’

Hence, in Figure 13.62, when R=r the power trans-
ferred from the source to the load is a maximum.

Typical practical applications of the maximum power
transfer theorem are found in stereo amplifier design,
seeking to maximize power delivered to speakers, and
in electric vehicle design, seeking to maximize power
delivered to drive a motor.

Alternating voltages and

Why it is important to understand: Alternating voltages and currents

With alternating current (a.c.), the flow of electric charge periodically reverses direction, whereas with
direct current (d.c.), the flow of electric charge is only in one direction. In a power station, electricity can
be made most easily by using a gas or steam turbine or water impeller to drive a generator consisting of a
spinning magnet inside a set of coils. The resultant voltage is always ‘alternating’ by virtue of the magnet’s
rotation. Alternating voltage can be carried around the country via cables far more effectively than direct
current because a.c. can be passed through a transformer and a high voltage can be reduced to a low
voltage, suitable for use in homes. The electricity arriving at your home is alternating voltage. Electric
light bulbs and toasters can operate perfectly from 230 volts a.c. Other equipment such as televisions
has an internal power supply which converts the 230 volts a.c. to a low d.c. voltage for the electronic
circuits. How is this done? There are several ways, but the simplest is to use a transformer to reduce
the voltage to, say, 12 volts a.c. This lower voltage can be fed through a ‘rectifier’ which combines the
negative and positive alternating cycles so that only positive cycles emerge. A.c. is the form in which
electric power is delivered to businesses and residences. The usual waveform of an a.c. power circuit is
a sine wave. In certain applications, different waveforms are used, such as triangular or square waves.
Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. The frequency
of the electrical system varies by country; most electric power is generated at either 50 or 60 hertz. Some
countries have a mixture of 50 Hz and 60 Hz supplies, notably Japan. A low frequency eases the design of
electric motors, particularly for hoisting, crushing and rolling applications, and commutator-type traction
motors for applications such as railways. However, low frequency also causes noticeable flicker in arc
lamps and incandescent light bulbs. The use of lower frequencies also provides the advantage of lower
impedance losses, which are proportional to frequency. 16.7 Hz frequency is still used in some European
rail systems, such as in Austria, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Off-shore, military, textile
industry, marine, computer mainframe, aircraft, and spacecraft applications sometimes use 400 Hz, for
benefits of reduced weight of apparatus or higher motor speeds. This chapter introduces alternating
current and voltages, with its terminology and values and its sinusoidal expression. Also, the addition of
two sine waves is explained, as are rectifiers and their smoothing.

Electricity is produced by generators at power stations
and then distributed by a vast network of transmission
lines (called the National Grid system) to industry and
for domestic use. It is easier and cheaper to generate
alternating current (a.c.) than direct current (d.c.) and
a.c. is more conveniently distributed than d.c. since its
voltage can be readily altered using transformers. When-
ever d.c. is needed in preference to a.c., devices called
rectifiers are used for conversion (see Section 14.7).

Let a single turn coil be free to rotate at constant angular
velocity symmetrically between the poles of a magnet
system, as shown in Figure 14.1.

An e.m.f. is generated in the coil (from Faraday’s
laws) which varies in magnitude and reverses its direc-
tion at regular intervals. The reason for this is shown in
Figure 14.2. In positions (a), (e) and (i) the conductors
of the loop are effectively moving along the magnetic
field, no flux is cut and hence no e.m-.f. is induced.
In position (c) maximum flux is cut and hence maximum
e.m.f. is induced. In position (g), maximum flux is cut -F
and hence maximum e.m.f. is again induced. However,
using Fleming’s right-hand rule, the induced e.m-f. is

in the opposite direction to that in position (c) and is
thus shown as —E. In positions (b), (d), (f) and (h) some
flux is cut and hence some e.mf. is induced. If all such
positions of the coil are considered, in one revolution
of the coil one cycle of alternating e.m.f. is produced
as shown. This is the principle of operation of the a.c.
generator (i.e. the alternator).

14.3 Waveforms

If values of quantities which vary with time ¢ are plot-
ted to a base of time, the resulting graph is called
a waveform. Some typical waveforms are shown in
Figure 14.3. Waveforms (a) and (b) are unidirectional
waveforms, for, although they vary considerably with
time, they flow in one direction only (i.e. they do not
cross the time axis and become negative). Waveforms
(c) to (g) are called alternating waveforms since their
quantities are continually changing in direction (i.e.
alternately positive and negative).

Figure 14.3

A waveform of the type shown in Figure 14.3(g) is called
a sine wave. It is the shape of the waveform of e.m-f.
produced by an alternator and thus the mains electricity
supply is of ‘sinusoidal’ form.

One complete series of values is called a cycle (i.e. from
O to P in Figure 14.3(g)).

The time taken for an alternating quantity to complete
one cycle is called the period or the periodic time, T,
of the waveform.

The number of cycles completed in one second is called
the frequency, f, of the supply and is measured in
hertz,* Hz. The standard frequency of the electricity
supply in Great Britain is 50 Hz.

14.4 A.c. values

Instantaneous values are the values of the alternating
quantities at any instant of time. They are represented
by small letters, i, v, e, etc. (see Figures 14.3(f) and (g)).

The largest value reached in a half cycle is called the
peak value or the maximum value or the amplitude of
the waveform. Such values are represented by Vin, Im,
etc. (see Figures 14.3(f) and (g)). A peak-to-peak value
of e.m.f. is shown in Figure 14.3(g) and is the difference
between the maximum and minimum values in a cycle.

The average or mean value of a symmetrical alter-
nating quantity (such as a sine wave) is the average value
measured over a half cycle (since over a complete cycle
the average value is zero).

area under the curve

Average or mean value =
S length of base

The area under the curve is found by approximate

methods such as the trapezoidal rule, the mid-ordinate

rule or Simpson’s rule. Average values are represented

by Vay, Tay, ete.

For a sine wave,
average value= 0.637 x maximum value
(i.e. 2/2 x maximum value)

The effective value of an alternating current is that cur-
rent which will produce the same heating effect as an
equivalent direct current. The effective value is called
the root mean square (r.m.s.) value and whenever an
alternating quantity is given, itis assumed to be the r.m.s.
value. For example, the domestic mains supply in Great
Britain is 240 V and is assumed to mean ‘240 Vr.m.s’.
The symbols used for r.m.s. values are J, V, EF, etc. For
a non-sinusoidal waveform as shown in Figure 14.4 the
r.m.s. value is given by:

An alternating voltage is triangular in shape,
rising at a constant rate to a maximum of 300 V
in 8ms and then falling to zero at a constant
rate in 4 ms. The negative half cycle is identical
in shape to the positive half cycle. Calculate
(a) the mean voltage over half a cycle, and
(b) the r.m.s. voltage.

Calculate the r.m.s. value of a sinusoidal curve

Find the peak and mean values for a 200 V

A sinusoidal voltage has a maximum value of
120 V. Calculate its r.m.s. and average values.

A sinusoidal current has a mean value of
15.0A. Determine its maximum and r.m.s.
values.

Insulation is used to prevent ‘leakage’, and when deter-
mining what type of insulation should be used, the
maximum voltage present must be taken into account.
For this reason, peak values are always considered
when choosing insulation materials.

Fuses are the weak link in a circuit and are used to
break the circuit if excessive current is drawn. Exces-
sive current could lead to a fire. Fuses rely on the
heating effect of the current, and for this reason r.m.s
values must always be used when calculating the
appropriate fuse size.

14.6 The equation of a sinusoidal

waveform

In Figure 14.8, OA represents a vector that is free to
rotate anticlockwise about 0 at an angular velocity of
orad/s. A rotating vector is known as a phasor.

Figure 14.8

After time f seconds the vector OA has turned through
an angle ot. If the line BC is constructed perpendicular
to OA as shown, then

i = BC BC = OBsinat
sin @. = OB i.e. = sina

If all such vertical components are projected on to a
graph of y against angle wf (in radians), a sine curve
results of maximum value OA. Any quantity which
varies sinusoidally can thus be represented as a phasor.

A sine curve may not always start at 0°. To show this
a periodic function is represented by y=sin(w@t+¢),
where ¢ is the phase (or angle) difference compared with
y=sinot. In Figure 14.9(a), y2=sin(@t+¢) starts
¢ radians earlier than yj =sinqt and is thus said to
lead y; by ¢ radians. Phasors y; and y2 are shown in
Figure 14.9(b) at the time when tf =0

In Figure 14.9(c), y4=sin(@t—¢) starts ¢@ radians
later than y3= sinq@t and is thus said to lag y3 by ¢

Comparing v = 75 sin(200zt —0.25) with the general

14.7 Combination of waveforms

The resultant of the addition (or subtraction) of two
sinusoidal quantities may be determined either:

(a) _ by plotting the periodic functions graphically (see
worked Problems 13 and 16), or

(b) by resolution of phasors by drawing or calculation
(see worked Problems 14 and 15).

Problem 13. The instantaneous values of two
alternating currents are given by 7; =20sinat
amperes and i2 = 10 sin(@t + 2/3) amperes. By
plotting 7; and 2 on the same axes, using the same
scale, over one cycle, and adding ordinates at
intervals, obtain a sinusoidal expression for i; +i2

ij =20sin@t and i2=10sin (cor + *) are shown plot-

ted in Figure 14.10.
Ordinates of i; and i2 are added at, say, 15° intervals (a
pair of dividers are useful for this).

i, = 20 sine?

For example,
at 30°, ij t+i2=10+10=20A
at 60°, ij) +i2=8.7+17.3=26A
at 150°, ij +i2=10+(—5)=5A, and so on.

The resultant waveform for i; +i2 is shown by the bro-
ken line in Figure 14.10. It has the same period, and
hence frequency, as i; and iz. The amplitude or peak
value is 26.5 A.

The resultant waveform leads the curve i; =20sinwt
by 19°,

. 1
1.e. (19 x Ty) rads = 0.332 rads

Hence the sinusoidal expression for the resultant i; +i2
is given by:

ig =iy + i2=26.5sin (wt +0.332)A

Problem 14. Two alternating voltages are
represented by vj =S50sinat volts and

v2 = 100 sin (wt — 7/6) V. Draw the phasor diagram
and find, by calculation, a sinusoidal expression

to represent 0; +02

Phasors are usually drawn at the instant when time tf =0.
Thus v; is drawn horizontally 50 units long and v2 is
drawn 100 units long, lagging v1 by z/6rads, i.e. 30°.
This is shown in Figure 14.11(a), where 0 is the point
of rotation of the phasors.

Procedure to draw phasor diagram to represent
vj +02:

(iii) The resultant or =v; +02 is given by the length
Ob and its phase angle ¢ may be measured with
respect to v1

Alternatively, when two phasors are being added the
resultant is always the diagonal of the parallelogram, as
shown in Figure 14.11(c).
From the drawing, by measurement, vr =145V and
angle 6=20° lagging v1

A more accurate solution is obtained by calculation,
using the cosine and sine rules. Using the cosine rule on
triangle Oab of Figure 14.11(b) gives:

vp = vt + v3 — 2v1v2c08 150°

= 507 + 1007 — 2(50)(100) cos 150°
= 2500 + 10000 — (—8660)

and ¢= sin—! 0.3436 = 0.35 radians, and lags 01
Hence vr =v; +02= 145.5 sin(wt — 0.35) V

Problem 15. Find a sinusoidal expression for
(ii +i2) of worked Problem 13, (a) by drawing
phasors, (b) by calculation.

(a) The relative positions of i; and i2 at time t =0 are
shown as phasors in Figure 14.12(a). The phasor
diagram in Figure 14.12(b) shows the resultant ip,
and ir is measured as 26A and angle ¢ as 19° or

An alternative method of calculation is to use complex
numbers (see Chapter 23).

Then i, +i2 = 20sinet + 10sin (or + *)

or 200° + 1060°

or 26.4620.333 rad

Problem 16. Two alternating voltages are given
by 01 =120sinat volts and v2 =200 sin(wt — 7/4)
volts. Obtain sinusoidal expressions for 01 — v2

(a) by plotting waveforms, and (b) by resolution of
phasors.

(a) vy =120sin@t and v2=200sin(wt—7/4) are
shown plotted in Figure 14.13. Care must be taken
when subtracting values of ordinates, especially
when at least one of the ordinates is negative. For
example

at 30°, vj —v2 = 60—(—52)=112 V
at 60°, v1 —v2 = 104—52=52V

at 150°, vy —v2 = 60 — 193 =—133 V and so on.

Hence, by drawing, vr =v; —02

(b) The relative positions of bj and v2 are shown at

opposite direction to +v2 and is shown by the bro-
ken line in Figure 14.14(a). The phasor diagram

14.8 Rectification

The process of obtaining unidirectional currents and
voltages from alternating currents and voltages is called
rectification. Automatic switching in circuits is achieved
using diodes (see Chapter 11).

Half-wave rectification

Using a single diode, D, as shown in Figure 14.15,
half-wave rectification is obtained. When P is suffi-
ciently positive with respect to Q, diode D is switched
on and currenti flows. When P is negative with respect
to Q, diode D is switched off. Transformer T isolates
the equipment from direct connection with the mains
supply and enables the mains voltage to be changed.
Thus, an alternating, sinusoidal waveform applied to
the transformer primary is rectified into a unidirectional
waveform. Unfortunately, the output waveform shown
in Figure 14.15 is not constant (i.e. steady), and as such,
would be unsuitable as a d.c. power supply for electronic

equipment. It would, however, be satisfactory as a bat-
tery charger. In Section 14.9, methods of smoothing the
output waveform are discussed.

Full-wave rectification using a
centre-tapped transformer

Two diodes may be used as shown in Figure 14.16 to
obtain full-wave rectification where a centre-tapped
transformer T is used. When P is sufficiently posi-
tive with respect to Q, diode D; conducts and current
flows (shown by the broken line in Figure 14.16). When
S is positive with respect to Q, diode D2 conducts
and current flows (shown by the continuous line in
Figure 14.16).

Figure 14.16

The current flowing in the load R is in the same
direction for both half-cycles of the input. The output
waveform is thus as shown in Figure 14.16. The output
is unidirectional, but is not constant; however, it is bet-
ter than the output waveform produced with a half-wave
rectifier. Section 14.8 explains how the waveform may
be improved so as to be of more use.

A disadvantage of this type of rectifier is that centre-
tapped transformers are expensive.

Full-wave bridge rectification

Four diodes may be used in a bridge rectifier circuit,
as shown in Figure 14.17, to obtain full-wave rectifica-
tion. (Note, the term ‘bridge’ means a network of four
elements connected to form a square, the input being
applied to two opposite corners and the output being
taken from the remaining two corners.) As for the recti-
fier shown in Figure 14.16, the current flowing in load R
is in the same direction for both half cycles of the input
giving the output waveform shown.

Following the broken line in Figure 14.17:
When P is positive with respect to Q, current flows from
the transformer to point E, through diode Dg to point F,

—— = — Current flow when P
is positive w.r.t. Q
Current flow when Q
is positive w.r.t. P

then through load R to point H, through D2 to point G,
and back to the transformer.

Following the full line in Figure 14.17:

When Q is positive with respect to P, current flows from
the transformer to point G, through diode D3 to point F,
then through load R to point H, through D, to point E,
and back to the transformer. The output waveform is not
steady and needs improving; a method of smoothing is
explained in the next section.

14.9 Smoothing of the rectified

output waveform

The pulsating outputs obtained from the half- and full-
wave rectifier circuits are not suitable for the operation
of equipment that requires a steady d.c. output, such
as would be obtained from batteries. For example, for
applications such as audio equipment, a supply with
a large variation is unacceptable since it produces ‘hum’
in the output. Smoothing is the process of removing the
worst of the output waveform variations.

To smooth out the pulsations a large capacitor, C, is
connected across the output of the rectifier, as shown in
Figure 14.18; the effect of this is to maintain the output
voltage at a level which is very near to the peak of the
output waveform. The improved waveforms for half-
wave and full-wave rectifiers are shown in more detail
in Figure 14.19.

Figure 14.20

During each pulse of output voltage, the capacitor C
charges to the same potential as the peak of the wave-
form, as shown as point X in Figure 14.19. As the
waveform dies away, the capacitor discharges across
the load, as shown by XY. The output voltage is then
restored to the peak value the next time the rectifier
conducts, as shown by YZ. This process continues as
shown in Figure 14.19.

Capacitor C is called a reservoir capacitor since
it stores and releases charge between the peaks of the
rectified waveform.

The variation in potential between points X and Y is
called ripple, as shown in Figure 14.19; the object is
to reduce ripple to a minimum. Ripple may be reduced
even further by the addition of inductance and another
capacitor in a ‘filter’ circuit arrangement, as shown in
Figure 14.20.

The output voltage from the rectifier is applied to
capacitor C, and the voltage across points AA is
shown in Figure 14.20, similar to the waveforms of
Figure 14.19. The load current flows through the induc-
tance L; when current is changing, e.m.f.s are induced,
as explained in Chapter 9. By Lenz’s law, the induced
voltages will oppose those causing the current changes.

As the ripple voltage increases and the load current
increases, the induced e.m.f. in the inductor will oppose
the increase. As the ripple voltage falls and the load
current falls, the induced e.m.f. will try to maintain the
current flow.

The voltage across points BB in Figure 14.20 and
the current in the inductance are almost ripple-free. A
further capacitor, C2, completes the process.

For a practical laboratory experiment on the use of
the CRO with a bridge rectifier circuit, see the website.

Chapter 15

Single-phase series
a.c. circuits

Why it is important to understand: Single-phase series a.c. circuits

The analysis of basic a.c. electric circuits containing impedances and ideal a.c. supplies are presented
in this chapter. Series circuits containing pure resistance, R, pure inductance, L, and pure capacitance,
C, are initially explained. Then series R-L, R-C and R-L-C series circuits are explored using phasors
which greatly simplifies the analysis. When capacitors or inductors are involved in an a.c. circuit, the
current and voltage do not peak at the same time. The fraction of a period difference between the peaks
expressed in degrees is said to be the phase difference. The phase difference is less than or equal to
90°. Calculations of current, voltage, reactance, impedance and phase are explained via many worked
examples. The important phenomena of resonance are explored in an R-L-C series circuit — there are
many applications for this circuit — together with Q-factor, bandwidth and selectivity. Resonance is used
in many different types of oscillator circuits; another important application is for tuning, such as in radio
receivers or television sets, where it is used to select a narrow range of frequencies from the ambient
radio waves. In this role the circuit is often referred to as a tuned circuit. Finally, power in a.c. circuits
is explained, together with the terms true power, apparent power, reactive power and power factor.

Single-phase series a.c. circuit theory is of great importance in electrical/electronic engineering.

The relationship between voltage and current for the
inductive and capacitive circuits can be summarized
using the word ‘CIVIL’, which represents the follow-
ing: in a capacitor (C) the current (I) is ahead of
the voltage (V), and the voltage (V) is ahead of the
current (I) for the inductor (L).

In an a.c. circuit containing inductance L and resistance
R, the applied voltage V is the phasor sum of Vr and
Vy (see Figure 15.6), and thus the current 7 lags the
applied voltage V by an angle lying between 0° and
90° (depending on the values of Vr and V;,), shown as
angle ¢. In any a.c. series circuit the current is common
to each component and is thus taken as the reference
phasor.

Figure 15.22 shows how current J varies with frequency
in an R-L-C series circuit. At the resonant frequency
j-, current is a maximum value, shown as /[,. Also
shown are the points A and B where the current is 0.707
of the maximum value at frequencies f; and f2. The
power delivered to the circuit is /*R. At [=0.7071,
the power is (0.7071,)° R=0.517 R, i.e. half the power
that occurs at frequency f;. The points corresponding
to fi and fy are called the half-power points. The dis-
tance between these points, i.e. (f2 — f1), is called the
bandwidth.

Selectivity is the ability of a circuit to respond more
readily to signals of a particular frequency to which it is
tuned than to signals of other frequencies. The response
becomes progressively weaker as the frequency departs
from the resonant frequency. The higher the Q-factor,
the narrower the bandwidth and the more selective is the
circuit. Circuits having high Q-factors (say, in the order
of 100 to 300) are therefore useful in communications
engineering. A high Q-factor in a series power circuit
has disadvantages in that it can lead to dangerously high
voltages across the insulation and may result in electrical
breakdown.

Single-phase parallel
a.c. circuits

Why it is important to understand: Single-phase parallel a.c. circuits

The analysis of basic a.c. parallel electric circuits containing impedances and ideal a.c. supplies are
presented in this chapter. Parallel networks containing R-L, R-C, L-C and R-L-C parallel circuits are
explored using phasors, which greatly simplifies the analysis. Calculations of current, voltage, reac-
tance, impedance and phase are explained via many worked examples. The important phenomena of
resonance are explored in an RL-C parallel circuit, together with Q-factor, bandwidth and selectivity.
Resonance is used in many different types of oscillator and filter circuits. A method of power factor
improvement is explained. If a network is 100% efficient, its power factor is 1 or unity. This is the
ideal for power transmission, but is practically impossible to attain. Variation in power factor is caused
by different types of electrical devices connected to the grid that consume or generate reactive power.
Unless this variation is corrected, higher currents are drawn from the grid, leading to grid instabil-
ity, higher costs and reduced transmission capacity. A poor power factor results in additional costs
for the electricity supplier. These costs are passed on to the customer as a ‘reactive power charge’
or ‘exceeded capacity charge’. All UK electricity suppliers impose a reactive penalty charge when
the average power factor falls below around 0.95. The causes of poor power factor include inductive
loads on equipment such as a.c. motors, arc welders, furnaces, fluorescent lighting and air condition-
ing. The more inductive loads there are on the network, the greater the possibility there is of a poor
power factor. Single-phase parallel a.c. circuit theory is of great importance in electrical/electronic
engineering.

lags the supply voltage by 90°. The supply current J is
the phasor sum of Jp and J; and thus the current J lags
the applied voltage V by an angle lying between 0° and

16.5 LR-C parallel a.c. circuit

In the two-branch circuit containing capacitance C in
parallel with inductance LZ and resistance R in series
(such as a coil) shown in Figure 16.5(a), the phasor dia-
gram for the LR branch alone is shown in Figure 16.5(b)
and the phasor diagram for the C branch is shown alone
in Figure 16.5(c). Rotating each and superimposing on
one another gives the complete phasor diagram shown
in Figure 16.5(d).

The current Jr of Figure 16.5(d) may be resolved
into horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal
component, shown as op, is I_rcos¢, and the vertical
component, shown as pq, is Jrrsing,. There are three
possible conditions for this circuit:

Gi) Ic > I_rsin dg, (giving a supply current J leading
V by angle ¢ — as shown in Figure 16.5(e))

(ii) JIzrsing, > Ic (giving J lagging V by angle ¢ —
as shown in Figure 16.5(f))

(iii) Ic =Izrsing, (this is called parallel resonance,
see Section 16.6).

There are two methods of finding the phasor sum of
currents J7r and Jc in Figures 16.5(e) and (f). These
are: (i) by a scaled phasor diagram, or (ii) by resolving

16.6 Parallel resonance and Q-factor

Parallel resonance

Resonance occurs in the two-branch network contain-
ing capacitance C in parallel with inductance L and
resistance R in series (see Figure 16.5(a)) when the
quadrature (i.e. vertical) component of current Izp is
equal to Jc. At this condition the supply current J is
in-phase with the supply voltage V.

Resonant frequency

When the quadrature component of Izpr is equal to Ic
then: Jc =I,rsin ¢; (see Figure 16.9)

resistance is known as the dynamic resistance, Rp (or
sometimes, the dynamic impedance).

Oscillations dying
Figure 16.11

Graphs of current and impedance against frequency
near to resonance for a parallel circuit are shown in
Figure 16.10, and are seen to be the reverse of those
in a Series circuit (from page 215).

Rejector circuit

The parallel resonant circuit is often described as
a rejector circuit since it presents its maximum
impedance at the resonant frequency and the resultant
current is a minimum.

Mechanical analogy

Electrical resonance for the parallel circuit can be
likened to a mass hanging on a spring which, if pulled
down and released, will oscillate up and down but due to
friction the oscillations will slowly die. To maintain the
oscillation the mass would require a small force applied
each time it reaches its point of maximum travel and
this is exactly what happens with the electrical circuit.
A small current is required to overcome the losses and
maintain the oscillations of current. Figure 16.11 shows
the two cases.

Applications of resonance

One use for resonance is to establish a condition of
stable frequency in circuits designed to produce a.c.
signals. Usually, a parallel circuit is used for this pur-
pose, with the capacitor and inductor directly connected
together, exchanging energy between each other. Just as
a pendulum can be used to stabilize the frequency of a
clock mechanism’s oscillations, so can a parallel circuit
be used to stabilize the electrical frequency of an a.c.
oscillator circuit.

Another use for resonance is in applications where the
effects of greatly increased or decreased impedance at a
particular frequency is desired. A resonant circuit can be
used to ‘block’ (i.e. present high impedance towards) a
frequency or range of frequencies, thus acting as a sort
of frequency ‘filter’ to strain certain frequencies out
of a mix of others. In fact, these particular circuits are
called filters, and their design is considered in Chapter
42. In essence, this is how analogue radio receiver tuner

Oscillations maintained

circuits work to filter, or select, one station frequency out
of the mix of different radio station frequency signals
intercepted by the antenna.

Q-factor

Currents higher than the supply current can circulate
within the parallel branches of a parallel resonant cir-
cuit, the current leaving the capacitor and establishing
the magnetic field of the inductor, this then collapsing
and recharging the capacitor, and so on. The Q-factor
of a parallel resonant circuit is the ratio of the current
circulating in the parallel branches of the circuit to the
supply current, i.e. the current magnification.

i.e. Q-factor at resonance=

(which is the same as for a series circuit)

Note that in a parallel circuit the Q-factor is a measure
of current magnification, whereas in a series circuit it
is a measure of voltage magnification.

At mains frequencies the Q-factor of a parallel cir-
cuit is usually low, typically less than 10, but in
radio-frequency circuits the Q-factor can be very high.

16.7 Power factor improvement

From page 222, in any a.c. circuit, power factor =
cos ¢, where ¢ is the phase angle between supply current
and supply voltage.

Industrial loads such as a.c. motors are essentially
inductive (i.e. R-L) and may have a low power
factor.

For example, let a motor take a current of 50A at a
power factor of 0.6 lagging from a 240 V, 50 Hz supply,
as shown in the circuit diagram of Figure 16.14(a).

If power factor = 0.6 lagging, then:
cos ¢ = 0.6 lagging
Hence, phase angle, ¢ = cos~! 0.6 = 53.13° lagging

Lagging means that J lags V (remember CIVIL), and
the phasor diagram is as shown in Figure 16.14(b).

How can this power factor of 0.6 be ‘improved’ or
‘corrected’ to, say, unity?

Unity power factor means: cos# = 1 from which,
¢=0

So how can the circuit of Figure 16.14(a) be modified
so that the circuit phase angle is changed from 53.13°
to 0°?

The answer is to connect a capacitor in parallel with
the motor as shown in Figure 16.15(a). When a capac-
itor is connected in parallel with the inductive load, it
takes a current shown as Jc. In the phasor diagram of
Figure 16.15(b), current Jc is shown leading the voltage
V by 90° (again, remember CIVIL).

The supply current in Figure 16.15(a) is shown as J and
is now the phasor sum of [jy and Ic

In the phasor diagram of Figure 16.15(b), current J is
shown as the phasor sum of Jy and Jc and is in phase
with V, i.e. the circuit phase angle is 0°, which means
that the power factor is cos0° = 1

Thus, by connecting a capacitor in parallel with the
motor, the power factor has been improved from 0.6
lagging to unity.

Before the capacitor was connected, the supply
current was 50 A. Now it is 30 A.

Herein lies the advantage of power factor improve-
ment — the supply current has been reduced.

When power factor is improved, the supply current
is reduced, the supply system has lower losses (i.e.
lower I7R losses) and therefore cheaper running
costs.

Problem 11. In the circuit of Figure 16.16, what
value of capacitor is needed to improve the power
factor from 0.6 lagging to unity?

V=240V, 50Hz

This is the same circuit as used above where the supply
current was reduced from 50 A to 30 A by power factor
improvement. In the phasor diagram of Figure 16.17,
current Jc needs to equal ab if I is to be in phase
with V.

In practical situations a power factor of | is not nor-
mally required but a power factor in the region of 0.8 or
better is usually aimed for. (Actually, a power factor of
1 means resonance!)

Problem 12. An inductive load takes a current of
60 A at a power factor of 0.643 lagging when
connected to a 240 V, 60 Hz supply. It is required to
improve the power factor to 0.80 lagging by
connecting a capacitor in parallel with the load.
Calculate (a) the new supply current, (b) the
capacitor current and (c) the value of the power

Problem 13. A motor has an output of 4.8kW, an
efficiency of 80% and a power factor of 0.625

It is required to improve the power factor to 0.95
lagging by connecting a capacitor in parallel with
the motor. Determine (a) the current taken by the
motor, (b) the supply current after power factor

(b) When a capacitor C is connected in parallel with

ply current 7, and has to be such as to change the
circuit power factor to 0.95 lagging, i.e. a phase

D.c. transients

The study of transient and steady state responses of a circuit is very important as they form the building
blocks of most electrical circuits. This chapter explores the response of capacitors and inductors to sudden
changes in d.c. voltage, called a transient voltage, when connected in series with a resistor. Unlike resistors,
which respond instantaneously to applied voltage, capacitors and inductors react over time as they absorb
and release energy. Each time a switch is made or an input is connected, circuit conditions change, but
only for a short time; during these brief transient events, components and circuits may behave differently
to the way they behave under normal ’static’ conditions. The voltage across a capacitor cannot change
instantaneously as some time is required for the electric charge to build up on, or leave the capacitor
plates. Series R-C networks have many practical uses. They are often used in timing circuits to control
events that must happen repeatedly at a fixed time interval. One example is a circuit that causes an LED
to blink on and off once every second. There are several ways to design a circuit to do this, but one of
the most common ways uses a series R-C circuit. By adjusting the value of the resistor or the capacitor,
the designer can cause the LED to blink faster or slower. An understanding of d.c. transients is thus
important and these are explained in this chapter.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

e understand the term ‘transient’

e describe the transient response of capacitor and resistor voltages, and current in a series C—R d.c. circuit
e define the term ‘time constant’

e calculate time constant in a C—R circuit

e draw transient growth and decay curves for an L-R circuit

e use equations vo, =Ve—"", orp =V(1 —e"”) andi=/(1—e~"")

17.1. Introduction

When a d.c. voltage is applied to a capacitor C and
resistor R connected in series, there is a short period of
time immediately after the voltage is connected, during
which the current flowing in the circuit and voltages
across C and R are changing.

Similarly, when a d.c. voltage is connected to a circuit
having inductance L connected in series with resistance
R, there is a short period of time immediately after the
voltage is connected, during which the current flow-
ing in the circuit and the voltages across L and R are
changing.

These changing values are called transients.

17.2 Charging a capacitor

(a) The circuit diagram for a series-connected C—R
circuit is shown in Figure 17.1. When switch S is
closed then by Kirchhoff’s voltage law:

V=vc+orR (1)

Figure 17.1

(b) The battery voltage V is constant. The capacitor
voltage vc is given by q/C, where q is the charge
on the capacitor. The voltage drop across Ris given
by iR, where i is the current flowing in the circuit.
Hence at all times:

vate (2)

Cc

At the instant of closing S (initial circuit condition),
assuming there is no initial charge on the capacitor,
go is zero, hence vco is zero. Thus from equa-
tion (1), V=0 + ogo, Le. URo = V. This shows that
the resistance to current is solely due to R, and the
initial current flowing, ip =] =VW/R

(c) A short time later at time ft; seconds after clos-
ing S, the capacitor is partly charged to, say,
qi coulombs because current has been flowing.
The voltage vc; is now qi/C volts. If the current
flowing is i; amperes, then the voltage drop across

D.c. transients 239

R has fallen to i,R volts. Thus, equation (2) is
now V=(qg/C)+i,R

(d) A short time later still, say at time ¢ seconds after
closing the switch, the charge has increased to qp
coulombs and v¢ has increased to g,/C volts. Since
V =vc + vp and V isaconstant, then vp decreases
to i2R. Thus vc is increasing and i and ve are
decreasing as time increases.

(e) Ultimately, a few seconds after closing S (ie. at
the final or steady state condition), the capacitor
is fully charged to, say, Q coulombs, current no
longer flows, i.e. i=0O, and hence ve =iR=0. It
follows from equation (1) that oc = V

(f) Curves showing the changes in vc, vr andi with
time are shown in Figure 17.2.

The curve showing the variation of vc with
time is called an exponential growth curve and
the graph is called the ‘capacitor voltage/time’
characteristic. The curves showing the variation
of vr and i with time are called exponential

decay curves, and the graphs are called ‘resistor

respectively. (The name ‘exponential’ shows that
the shape can be expressed mathematically by an
exponential mathematical equation, as shown in
Section 17.4.)

If a constant d.c. voltage is applied to a series-
connected C—R circuit, a transient curve of capac-
itor voltage vc is as shown in Figure 17.2(a).

With reference to Figure 17.3, let the constant volt-
age supply be replaced by a variable voltage supply
at time ¢; seconds. Let the voltage be varied so that
the current flowing in the circuit is constant.

Time

Figure 17.3

Since the current flowing is a constant, the curve
will follow a tangent, AB, drawn to the curve at
point A.

Let the capacitor voltage vc reach its final value
of V at time f2 seconds.

The time corresponding to (t2 —1t,) seconds is
called the time constant of the circuit, denoted
by the Greek letter ‘tau’, c. The value of the time
constant is CR seconds, i.e. for a series connected
C-R circuit,

time constant t = CR seconds

Since the variable voltage mentioned in para. (b)
above can be applied to any instant during the tran-
sient change, it may be applied at t =0, i.e. at the
instant of connecting the circuit to the supply. If
this is done, then the time constant of the circuit
may be defined as:

‘the time taken for a transient to reach its final state
if the initial rate of change is maintained’.

17.4 Transient curves for a C-R circuit

There are two main methods of drawing transient curves
graphically, these being:

(a)

(b)

the tangent method — this method is shown in
worked Problem 1 below and

the initial slope and three point method, which
is shown in worked Problem 2, and is based on
the following properties of a transient exponential
curve:

(i) for a growth curve, the value of a transient at a
time equal to one time constant is 0.632 of its
steady state value (usually taken as 63% of the
steady state value), at a time equal to two and
a half time constants is 0.918 of its steady state
value (usually taken as 92% of its steady state
value) and at a time equal to five time constants
is equal to its steady state value,

(ii) for a decay curve, the value of a transient at a
time equal to one time constant is 0.368 of its
initial value (usually taken as 37% of its initial
value), at a time equal to two and a half time
constants is 0.082 of its initial value (usually
taken as 8% of its initial value) and at a time
equal to five time constants is equal to zero.

The transient curves shown in Figure 17.2 have mathe-
matical equations, obtained by solving the differential
equations representing the circuit. The equations of the

curves are:
growth of capacitor voltage, vc = V(1 — e~/)
=V(1—e"")
decay of resistor voltage, vr =Ve/
= Ve" and

decay of current flowing,

i=Je~/R — Te7!t

These equations are derived analytically in Chapter 45.

Problem 1.

A 15\F uncharged capacitor is

connected in series with a 47k resistor across a
120 V d.c. supply. Use the tangential graphical
method to draw the capacitor voltage/time

characteristic of the circuit. From the characteristic,
determine the capacitor voltage at a time equal to
one time constant after being connected to the
supply, and also two seconds after being connected
to the supply. Also, find the time for the capacitor
voltage to reach one half of its steady state value.

D.c. transients 241

To construct an exponential curve, the time constant of
the circuit and steady state value need to be determined.

Time constant = CR = 15 \F x 47kQ
= 15 x 10-° x 47 x 10°
= 0.705 s

Steady state value of oc = V,
ie. vc = 120V

With reference to Figure 17.4, the scale of the horizontal
axis is drawn so that it spans at least five time constants,
ie. 5 x 0.705 or about 3.5 seconds. The scale of the
vertical axis spans the change in the capacitor voltage,
that is, from 0 to 120V. A broken line AB is drawn
corresponding to the final value of oc

Time {s)

Figure 17.4

Point C is measured along AB so that AC is equal
to It, ie. AC = 0.705s. Straight line OC is drawn.
Assuming that about five intermediate points are needed
to draw the curve accurately, a point D is selected on
OC corresponding to a vc value of about 20V. DE is
drawn vertically. EF is made to correspond to It, i.e.
EF = 0.705s. A straight line is drawn joining DF. This
procedure of

(a) drawing a vertical line through point selected,

(b) at the steady state value, drawing a horizontal line
corresponding to Ir, and

(c) joining the first and last points,

is repeated for vc values of 40, 60, 80 and 100 V, giving
points G, H, Land J.

The capacitor voltage effectively reaches its steady
state value of 120V after a time equal to five time

constants, shown as point K. Drawing a smooth curve
through points O, D, G, H, I, J and K gives the
exponential growth curve of capacitor voltage.

From the graph, the value of capacitor voltage at a
time equal to the time constant is about 75V. It is a
characteristic of all exponential growth curves that after
a time equal to one time constant, the value of the tran-
sient is 0.632 of its steady state value. In this problem,
0.632 x 120 = 75.84V. Also from the graph, when
t is two seconds, vc is about 115 V. [This value may
be checked using the equation vc(1 —e~""), where
V = 120V, t= 0.705s and t= 2s. This calculation
gives bc = 112.97V.]

The time for vc to rise to one half of its final
value, i.e. 60V, can be determined from the graph
and is about 0.5s. [This value may be checked using
vc=V(1—e"") where V=120V, vc=60V and
t =0.705s, giving t=0.489s]

Problem 2. A 4 F capacitor is charged to 24 V
and then discharged through a 220 kQ resistor. Use
the “initial slope and three point’ method to draw:
(a) the capacitor voltage/time characteristic, (b) the
resistor voltage/time characteristic and (c) the
current/time characteristic, for the transients which
occur. From the characteristics determine the value
of capacitor voltage, resistor voltage and current
one and a half seconds after discharge has started.

To draw the transient curves, the time constant of the
circuit and steady state values are needed.

Time constant, 7 = CR =4 x 10~° x 220 x 103

Initially, capacitor voltage oc = vr = 24 V,

Finally, oc =vr=i=0

(a) The exponential decay of capacitor voltage is from
24 V to 0V in a time equal to five time constants,
ie. 5 x 0.88=4.4s. With reference to Figure 17.5,
to construct the decay curve:

(i) the horizontal scale is made so that it spans
at least five time constants, i.e. 4.4,

(ii) _ the vertical scale is made to span the change
in capacitor voltage, i.e. 0 to 24 V,

(iii) point A corresponds to the initial capacitor
voltage, i.e. 24 V,

(v) the value of the transient after a time equal

value, i.e. 0.368 x 24=8.83 V; a vertical
line is drawn through B and distance BC
is made equal to 8.83 V,

(vi) the value of the transient after a time equal
to two and a half time constants is 0.082 of
the initial value, i.e. 0.082 x 24=1.97 V,
shown as point D in Figure 17.5,

Figure 17.5

(vii) the transient effectively dies away to zero
after a time equal to five time constants,
i.e. 4.48, giving point E.

The smooth curve drawn through points A, C,

D and E represents the decay transient. At 15 S

after decay has started, oc ~4.4V. [This may be

checked using vc = Ve", where V =24, t= 15

and rt =0.88, giving oc =4.36 V]

The voltage drop across the resistor is equal to
the capacitor voltage when a capacitor is dischar-
ging through a resistor, thus the resistor voltage/
time characteristic is identical to that shown in
Figure 17.5.

Since vr =vc¢, then at 1 5 seconds after decay has
started, vr ~4.4 V (see (vii) above).

The current/time characteristic is constructed in
the same way as the capacitor voltage/time

characteristic, shown in part (a) of this problem,
and is as shown in Figure 17.6. The values are:

point C: at 17, i=0.368 x 0.109=0.040 mA

point E: at57,i=0

Hence the current transient is as shown. At a time
of 15 seconds, the value of current, from the char-
acteristic is 0.02 mA. [This may be checked using

17.5 Discharging a capacitor

When a capacitor is charged (i.e. with the switch in pos-
ition A in Figure 17.7), and the switch is then moved to
position B, the electrons stored in the capacitor keep the
current flowing for a short time. Initially, at the instant
of moving from A to B, the current flow is such that
the capacitor voltage vc is balanced by an equal and
opposite voltage pr =iR. Since initially ocp=vr=V,
then i=7=V/R. During the transient decay, by apply-
ing Kirchhoff’s voltage law to Figure 17.7, oc=vpr.
Finally the transients decay exponentially to zero,
ie. Dc =vr=0. The transient curves representing the
voltages and current are as shown in Figure 17.8.

When acapacitor has been disconnected from the sup-
ply it may still be charged and it may retain this charge
for some considerable time. Thus precautions must be
taken to ensure that the capacitor is automatically dis-
charged after the supply is switched off. This is done
by connecting a high-value resistor across the capacitor
terminals.

Problem 6. A capacitor is charged to 100 V and
then discharged through a 50k© resistor. If the
time constant of the circuit is 0.8s, determine:

(a) the value of the capacitor, (b) the time for the
capacitor voltage to fall to 20 V, (c) the current
flowing when the capacitor has been discharging
for 0.5 s, and (d) the voltage drop across the resistor
when the capacitor has been discharging for one
second.

Parts (b), (c) and (d) of this problem may be solved
graphically, as shown in worked Problems | and 2 or by
calculation as shown below.

V =100V,7 =0.08s, R =50kQ=50x 10°Q

17.6 Camera flash

The internal workings of a camera flash are an example
of the application of C—R circuits. When a camera is
first switched on, a battery slowly charges a capacitor to
its full potential via a C—R circuit. When the capacitor
is fully charged, an indicator (red light) typically lets
the photographer know that the flash is ready for use.
Pressing the shutter button quickly discharges the
capacitor through the flash (i.e. a resistor). The current
from the capacitor is responsible for the bright light
that is emitted. The flash rapidly draws current in order
to emit the bright light. The capacitor must then be
discharged before the flash can be used again.

17.7 Current growth in an L-R circuit

(a) The circuit diagram for a series-connected L—R
circuit is shown in Figure 17.10. When switch S is
closed, then by Kirchhoff’s voltage law:

V=vy_u+or (3)

Figure 17.10

(b) The battery voltage V is constant. The voltage
across the inductance is the induced voltage, i.e.

change of current di

vp =Lx - =
change of time dt

The voltage drop across R, vr is given by ik.
Hence, at all times:

V = L(di/dt)+iR (4)

(c) At the instant of closing the switch, the rate
of change of current is such that it induces an
e.m.f. in the inductance which is equal and oppo-
site to V, hence V= vy, + O, i.e. op = V. From
equation (3), because vo. =V, then vrp= O and
i=0.

(d) A short time later at time t; seconds after clos-
ing S, current i; is flowing since there is a rate
of change of current initially, resulting in a volt-
age drop of i;R across the resistor. Since V
(constant) =v, + vp the induced e.m-f. is reduced,
and equation (4) becomes:

diy,
V=L—-+iR
dt,

(e) A short time later still, say at time f2 seconds after
closing the switch, the current flowing is i2, and the
voltage drop across the resistor increases to i2R.
Since op increases, vy, decreases.

(f) Ultimately, a few seconds after closing S, the
current flow is entirely limited by R, the rate of
change of current is zero and hence vz is zero. Thus

V =iR. Under these conditions, steady state cur-
rent flows, usually signified by 7. Thus, J =V/R,
Op =IR and vo, =0 at steady state conditions.

(g) Curves showing the changes in 0; vr andi with
time are shown in Figure 17.11 and indicate that
vy is a maximum value initially (i.e equal to V),
decaying exponentially to zero, whereas vr and i
grow exponentially from zero to their steady state
values of V and [= V/R, respectively.

17.9 Transient curves for an L-R
circuit

Transient curves representing the induced voltage/time,
resistor voltage/time and current/time characteristics
may be drawn graphically, as outlined in Section 17.4. A
method of construction is shown in worked Problem 8.
Each of the transient curves shown in Figure 17.11 have
mathematical equations, and these are:

method to draw the current/time characteristic and
hence determine the value of current flowing at a
time equal to two time constants and the time for
the current to grow to 1.5A.

Before the current/time characteristic can be drawn, the
time constant and steady state value of the current have
to be calculated.

17.10 Current decay in an L-R circuit

When a series-connected L—R circuit is connected
to a d.c. supply as shown with S in position A of
Figure 17.13, a current J = W/R flows after a short time,
creating a magnetic field (WJ) associated with the
inductor. When S is moved to position B, the current
value decreases, causing a decrease in the strength of the
magnetic field. Flux linkages occur, generating a voltage
vz, equal to L(di/dt). By Lenz’s law, this voltage keeps
currenti flowing in the circuit, its value being limited by
R.Since V =v, +vrR,0=v, +vp andvy = —vp, Le.
vy and vp are equal in magnitude but opposite in direc-
tion. The current decays exponentially to zero and since
DR 1S proportional to the current flowing, or decays
exponentially to zero. Since vo, =vR, vy also decays
exponentially to zero. The curves representing these
transients are similar to those shown in Figure 17.8.

obtained by making OB equal to | time constant,

sponding to a current of 6 A. Make DE equal to

discrepancy between the two results is due
to relatively few values, such as C, F, G and

calculation using i=Ie~/™, where i=5,

the discrepancy between the graphical and

17.11 Switching inductive circuits

Energy stored in the magnetic field of an inductor exists
because a current provides the magnetic field. When the
d.c. supply is switched off the current falls rapidly, the
magnetic field collapses causing a large induced e.m.f.
which will either cause an arc across the switch contacts
or will break down the insulation between adjacent turns
of the coil. The high induced e.m.f. acts in a direction
which tends to keep the current flowing, i.e. in the same
direction as the applied voltage. The energy from the
magnetic field will thus be aided by the supply voltage
in maintaining an arc, which could cause severe dam-
age to the switch. To reduce the induced e.m.f. when
the supply switch is opened, a discharge resistor Rp
is connected in parallel with the inductor as shown in
Figure 17.16. The magnetic field energy is dissipated as
heat in Rp and R and arcing at the switch contacts is
avoided.

Operational amplifiers

The term operational amplifier, abbreviated to op amp, was coined in the 1940s to refer to a special kind
of amplifier that, by proper selection of external components, could be configured to perform a variety
of mathematical operations. Early op amps were made from vacuum tubes consuming lots of space and
energy. Later op amps were made smaller by implementing them with discrete transistors. Today, op
amps are monolithic integrated circuits, highly efficient and cost effective. Operational amplifiers can
be used to perform mathematical operations on voltage signals such as inversion, addition, subtraction,
integration, differentiation and multiplication by a constant. The op amp is one of the most useful and
important components of analogue electronics and they are widely used. This chapter explains the main
properties of op amps and explains the principle of operation of the inverter, non-inverter, voltage follower,
summing, voltage comparator, integrator and differentiator op amps. In addition digital to analogue and
analogue to digital conversions are explained.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

e recognize the main properties of an operational amplifier

18.1 Introduction to operational

amplifiers

Operational amplifiers (usually called ‘op amps’)
were originally made from discrete components, being
designed to solve mathematical equations electroni-
cally, by performing operations such as addition and
division in analogue computers. Now produced in
integrated-circuit (IC) form, op amps have many uses,
with one of the most important being as a high-gain d.c.
and a.c. voltage amplifier.

The main properties of an op amp include:

(i) avery high open-loop voltage gain A, of around
10° for d.c. and low frequency a.c., which
decreases with frequency increase

(ii) a very high input impedance, typically 10°Q to
10!2.Q, such that current drawn from the device, or
the circuit supplying it, is very small and the input
voltage is passed on to the op amp with little loss

(iii) a very low output impedance, around 100 Q, such
that its output voltage is transferred efficiently to
any load greater than a few kilohms

The circuit diagram symbol for an op amp is shown in
Figure 18.1. It has one output, V,, and two inputs; the
inverting input, V1, is marked — and the non-inverting
input, V2, is marked +

The operation of an op amp is most convenient
from a dual balanced d.c. power supply + Vs (i.e. + Vs,
0,—Vs); the centre point of the supply, i.e. OV, is
common to the input and output circuits and is taken
as their voltage reference level. The power supply
connections are not usually shown in a circuit diagram.

An op amp is basically a differential voltage ampli-
fier, i.e. it amplifies the difference between input
voltages V; and V2. Three situations are possible:

(i) if V2> Vj, Vo is positive
(ii) if V2 < Vj, V, is negative

dil) if Vo=Vj, Vo is zero.

Problem 1. A differential amplifier has an
open-loop voltage gain of 120. The input signals are
2.45 V and 2.35 V. Calculate the output voltage of
the amplifier.

From equation (1), output voltage,

Vo = Ao(V2 — Vi) = 120(2.45 — 2.35)
= (120)(0.1) =12 V

Transfer characteristic

A typical voltage characteristic showing how the out-
put V, varies with the input (V2—Vj) is shown in
Figure 18.2.

Saturation

Saturation

Figure 18.2

It is seen from Figure 18.2 that only within the very
small input range POQ is the output directly proportional
to the input; it is in this range that the op amp behaves
linearly and there is minimum distortion of the amplifier
output. Inputs outside the linear range cause saturation
and the output is then close to the maximum value, i.e.
+Vs5 or —Vs. The limited linear behaviour is due to the
very high open-loop gain Ag, and the higher it is the
greater is the limitation.

Operational amplifiers 255

Negative feedback

Operational amplifiers nearly always use negative
feedback, obtained by feeding back some, or all, of
the output to the inverting (—) input (as shown in
Figure 18.5 later). The feedback produces an output
voltage that opposes the one from which it is taken. This
reduces the new output of the amplifier and the resulting
closed-loop gain A is then less than the open-loop gain
Ao. However, as a result, a wider range of voltages can
be applied to the input for amplification. As long as
Ao >> A, negative feedback gives:
(i) a constant and predictable voltage gain A,
(ii) reduced distortion of the output, and (iii) better
frequency response.

The advantages of using negative feedback outweigh
the accompanying loss of gain which is easily increased
by using two or more op amp stages.

Bandwidth

The open-loop voltage gain of an op amp is not constant
at all frequencies; because of capacitive effects it falls at
high frequencies. Figure 18.3 shows the gain/bandwidth
characteristic of a 741 op amp. At frequencies below
10 Hz the gain is constant, but at higher frequencies the
gain falls at a constant rate of 6 dB/octave (equivalent to
a rate of 20dB per decade) to 0dB

The gain-bandwidth product for any amplifier is the
linear voltage gain multiplied by the bandwidth at that
gain. The value of frequency at which the open-loop gain
has fallen to unity is called the transition frequency fr

In Figure 18.3, fr =10°Hz or 1 MHz; a gain of 20 dB
(i.e. 20 logig 10) gives a 100 kHz bandwidth, whilst a
gain of 80 dB (i.e. 20 logy9 10*) restricts the bandwidth
to 100 Hz.

18.2 Some op amp parameters

Input bias current

The input bias current, Jz, is the average of the currents
into the two input terminals with the output at zero
volts, which is typically around 80 nA (i.e. 80 x 10~° A)
for a 741 op amp. The input bias current causes a volt
drop across the equivalent source impedance seen by
the op amp input.

Input offset current

The input offset current, /,;, of an op amp is the differ-
ence between the two input currents with the output at
zero volts. Ina 741 op amp, Js is typically 20 nA.

Input offset voltage

In the ideal op amp, with both inputs at zero there
should be zero output. Due to imbalances within the
amplifier this is not always the case and a small output
voltage results. The effect can be nullified by applying
a small offset voltage, V,s;, to the amplifier. In a 741 op
amp, Vos is typically 1 mV.

Common-mode rejection ratio

The output voltage of an op amp is proportional to the
difference between the voltages applied to its two input
terminals. Ideally, when the two voltages are equal, the
output voltages should be zero. A signal applied to both
input terminals is called a common-mode signal and it
is usually an unwanted noise voltage. The ability of an
op amp to suppress common-mode signals is expressed
in terms of its common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR),
which is defined by:

CMRR = 20 logo — voltage a)

common mode gain

(3)
In a 741 op amp, the CMRR is typically 90 dB.
The common-mode gain, Acom, is defined as:
V
Acom = s (4)

where Voom is the common input signal

Problem 2. Determine the common-mode gain of
an op amp that has a differential voltage gain of
150 x 10° and a CMRR of 90 dB.

Slew rate

The slew rate of an op amp is the maximum rate of
change of output voltage following a step input volt-
age. Figure 18.4 shows the effects of slewing; it causes
the output voltage to change at a slower rate than the
input, such that the output waveform is a distortion of
the input waveform. 0.5 V/s is a typical value for the
slew rate.

18.3. Op amp inverting amplifier

The basic circuit for an inverting amplifier is shown in
Figure 18.5, where the input voltage V; (a.c. or d.c.) to be
amplified is applied via resistor R; to the inverting (—)
terminal; the output voltage V, is therefore in anti-phase

with the input. The non-inverting (+) terminal is held
at 0 V. Negative feedback is provided by the feedback
resistor, R ¢, feeding back a certain fraction of the output
voltage to the inverting terminal.

Amplifier gain

In an ideal op amp two assumptions are made, these
being that:

(i) each input draws zero current from the signal

source, i.e. their input impedances are infinite, and

(ii) the inputs are both at the same potential if the op
amp is not saturated, i.e. V4 = Vz in Figure 18.5.

In Figure 18.5, Vg =0, hence V4=0 and point X is
called a virtual earth.

The closed-loop gain A is given by:

A= Yo = “Ry

(5)

This shows that the gain of the amplifier depends only
on the two resistors, which can be made with precise
values, and not on the characteristics of the op amp,
which may vary from sample to sample.

For example, if Rj =10kQ and R¢ = 100kQ, then the
closed-loop gain,

—Rr _-100x 10° |

A= =
Ri 10 x 103

—10

Thus an input of 100mV will cause an output change
of 1V.

Input impedance

Since point X is a virtual earth (i.e. at 0 V), R; may
be considered to be connected between the inverting
(—) input terminal and 0 V. The input impedance of the
circuit is therefore Rj in parallel with the much greater
input impedance of the op amp, i.e. effectively R;. The
circuit input impedance can thus be controlled by simply
changing the value of Rj

Problem 4. In the inverting amplifier of
Figure 18.5, Rj =1kQ and Rs =2kQ.
Determine the output voltage when the input

(b) The input bias current, [g, causes a volt drop across

Hence, the offset voltage, V,s, at the input due to
the 100nA input bias current, J, is given by:

(c) The effect of input bias current can be minimized

by ensuring that both inputs ‘see’ the same driving
resistance. This means that a resistance of value
9.9kQ (from part (b)) should be placed between
the non-inverting (+) terminal and earth in
Figure 18.6.

Problem 6. Design an inverting amplifier to have
a voltage gain of 40 dB, a closed-loop bandwidth of
5 kHz and an input resistance of 10kQ.

18.4 Op amp non-inverting amplifier

The basic circuit for a non-inverting amplifier is shown
in Figure 18.8, where the input voltage V; (a.c. or d.c.)
is applied to the non-inverting (+-) terminal of the op
amp. This produces an output V, that is in phase with
the input. Negative feedback is obtained by feeding
back to the inverting (—) terminal, the fraction of V,
developed across Rj in the voltage divider formed by
Ry and R; across Vg

Again, the gain depends only on the values of Rj and
Rf and is independent of the open-loop gain A,

Input impedance

Since there is no virtual earth at the non-inverting (+)
terminal, the input impedance is much higher (typi-
cally 50 MQ) than that of the inverting amplifier. Also,
it is unaffected if the gain is altered by changing Rf
and/or R;. This non-inverting amplifier circuit gives
good matching when the input is supplied by a high
impedance source.

follower since, as with its transistor emitter-follower
equivalent, V, follows V;. It has an extremely high input
impedance and a low output impedance. Its main use
is as a buffer amplifier, giving current amplification,
to match a high impedance source to a low impedance
load. For example, it is used as the input stage of an
analogue voltmeter where the highest possible input
impedance is required so as not to disturb the circuit
under test; the output voltage is measured by a relatively
low impedance moving-coil meter.

18.6 Op amp summing amplifier

Because of the existence of the virtual earth point, an
op amp can be used to add a number of voltages (d.c. or
a.c.) when connected as a multi-input inverting ampli-
fier. This, in turn, is a consequence of the high value
of the open-loop voltage gain A,. Such circuits may
be used as ‘mixers’ in audio systems to combine the
outputs of microphones, electric guitars, pick-ups, etc.
They are also used to perform the mathematical process
of addition in analogue computing.

The circuit of an op amp summing amplifier having
three input voltages V}, V2 and V3 applied via input
resistors Rj, R2 and R3 is shown in Figure 18.11. Ifit is
assumed that the inverting (—) terminal of the op amp

draws no input current, all of it passing through Rf,
then:

T=h4+h+h

Since X is a virtual earth (i.e. at 0 V), it follows that:
—Vv Vi v2, V3
Rf ~ Ri Ro k3

Hence

Ry Ry Ry

The three input voltages are thus added and amplified if
Rf is greater than each of the input resistors; ‘weighted’
summation is said to have occurred.

Alternatively, the input voltages are added and attenu-

ated if Ry is less than each input resistor.

If Rj = Ro = R3=R;, the input voltages are amplified
or attenuated equally, and

If, also, Ri =Ry then Vj =— (Vi + V2+ V3)

The virtual earth is also called the summing point of
the amplifier. It isolates the inputs from one another so
that each behaves as if none of the others existed and
none feeds any of the other inputs even though all the
resistors are connected at the inverting (—) input.

18.7 Op amp voltage comparator

If both inputs of the op amp shown in Figure 18.13 are
used simultaneously, then from equation (1), page 254,
the output voltage is given by:

Vo = Ao(V2 _ V1)

When V2 > V then V, is positive, its maximum value
being the positive supply voltage +V;, which it has
when (V2 — V,) > V;/Aj. The op amp is then saturated.
For example, if V; =+9V and Ay = 10°, then saturation

Operational amplifiers 261

occurs when (V3 — V,) > 9/10° i.e. when Vz exceeds V,
by 90V and V, ~9V.

When V| > V3, then V, is negative and saturation occurs
if V; exceeds V> by V,/A, i.e. around 90 | V in the above
example; in this case, V, ~-—-V,=—9V

A small change in (V2—Vj}) therefore causes V, to
switch between near +V, and near to —V, and enables
the op amp to indicate when V> is greater or less than
Vi, ie. to act as a differential amplifier and com-
pare two voltages. It does this in an electronic digital
voltmeter.

Resistor R and the light-dependent resistor (LDR)
form a voltage divider across the +15/0/—15 V sup-
ply. The op amp compares the voltage V, at the voltage
divider junction, i.e. at the inverting (—) input, with that
at the non-inverting (+) input, i.e. with V2, which is 0 V.
In the dark the resistance of the LDR is much greater
than that of R, so more of the 30V across the volt-
age divider is dropped across the LDR, causing V; to
fall below 0 V. Now V2 > Vj and the output voltage V,
switches from near —15 V to near +15 V and the light
emitting diode (LED) lights.

18.8 Op amp integrator

The circuit for the op amp integrator shown in Figure
18.15 is the same as for the op amp inverting ampli-
fier shown in Figure 18.5, but feedback occurs via a
capacitor, C, rather than via a resistor.

Figure 18.15

The output voltage is given by:
1
Vo == ay [ Viet 9)

Since the inverting (—) input is used in Figure 18.15, V,
is negative if V; is positive, and vice-versa, hence the
negative sign in equation (9).

Since X is a virtual earth in Figure 18.15, i.e. at 0 V, the
voltage across R is V; and that across C is V,. Assuming
again that none of the input current J enters the op amp
inverting (—) input, then all of current J flows through
C and charges it up. If V; is constant, J will be a constant
value given by J = V;/R. Capacitor C therefore charges
at a constant rate and the potential of the output side of
C (=V,, since its input side is zero) charges so that the
feedback path absorbs J. If Q is the charge on C at time
t and the p.d. across it (i.e. the output voltage) changes
from 0 to V, in that time then:

Q =—V,C = It (from Chapter 6)

ie. —V.C=—t

This result is the same as would be obtained from

Vo=- V; dt if V; is a constant value.

CR
For example, if the input voltage V; =—2V and, say,
CR=1s, then

Vo = —(—2)t = 2t

A graph of V,/t will be a ramp function as shown
in Figure 18.16 (V,=2t is of the straight line form
y=mx +c; in this case y= V, and x =f, gradient, m=2
and vertical axis intercept c=0). V, rises steadily by
+2 V/s in Figure 18.16, and if the power supply is, say,
+9 V, then V, reaches +9 V after 4.5 s when the op amp
saturates.

(ii) By similar reasoning, if V2 is applied to termi-
nal 2 and OV to terminal 1, then the voltage
appearing at the non-inverting terminal will be
(R3/(R2 + R3))V2 volts. This voltage will also
appear at the inverting (—) terminal and thus the
voltage across R is equal to — (R3/(R2 + R3))V2
volts.
Now the output voltage,

18.10 Digital to analogue (D/A)

conversion

There are a number of situations when digital signals
have to be converted to analogue ones. For example, a
digital computer often needs to produce a graphical dis-
play on the screen; this involves using a D/A converter
to change the two-level digital output voltage from the
computer into a continuously varying analogue voltage
for the input to the oscilloscope so that it can deflect the
electron beam to produce screen graphics.

A binary weighted resistor D/A converter is shown
in Figure 18.22 for a four-bit input. The values of the
resistors, R,2R,4R, 8R increase according to the binary
scale — hence the name of the converter. The circuit
uses an op amp as a summing amplifier (see Section
18.6) with a feedback resistor R ¢. Digitally controlled
electronic switches are shown as S; to S4. Each switch
connects the resistor in series with it to a fixed reference
voltage Vref when the input bit controlling it is a 1 and
to ground (0 V) when it is a 0. The input voltages V; to
V4 applied to the op amp by the four-bit input via the
resistors therefore have one of two values, i.e. either Vyer
or 0 V.

From equation (8), page 260, the analogue output
voltage V, is given by:

Again, if Vier = — 8 V, then output voltage,

Vo = -(0+ (-8) 40+ 2-8) =+5V

If the input is 0111 (i.e. decimal 7), the output volt-
age will be 7 V, and so on. From these examples, it is
seen that the analogue output voltage, V,, is directly
proportional to the digital input.

Vo is again used, in this case as a voltage comparator (see
Section 18.7). The analogue input voltage V2, shown in
Figure 18.25(a) as a steady d.c. voltage, is applied to
(a) Mi the non-inverting (+) input, whilst a sawtooth voltage
VY supplies the inverting (—) input.

(b) Comparator equals or exceeds V2, when it then goes to 0 (i.e. ‘low’)
output as shown in Figure 18.25(b). The other input of the AND
0 gate is fed by a steady train of pulses from a pulse gen-
erator, as shown in Figure 18.25(c). When both inputs
A to the AND gate are ‘high’, the gate ‘opens’ and gives a
‘high’ output, i.e. a pulse, as shown in Figure 18.25(d).
(c) Pulse . : :

the analogue voltage if the ramp is linear. The output
pulses from the AND gate are recorded by a binary

equivalent of the analogue input voltage V2. In prac-
(d) AND tice, the ramp generator is a D/A converter which takes
gate its digital input from the binary counter, shown by the
output broken lines in Figure 18.24. As the counter advances

ouput SSSS5555F form with equal steps (i.e. aramp) is built up at the output

Three-phase systems

A three-phase circuit is an electrical distribution method that uses three alternating currents to supply
power. This type of power distribution is the most widely used in the world for transferring power from
generating systems to electrical supply grids. A three-phase circuit is also commonly used on large motors,
pumps and other pieces of mechanical equipment. Most households receive electricity in the form of
single-phase circuits, though some may have special three-phase circuit breakers installed for appliances
such as washing machines or stoves. A three-phase system is usually more economical than an equivalent
single-phase or two-phase system at the same voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit
electrical power. The three currents, together, deliver a balanced load, something not possible with single-
phase alternating current. With alternating current, the current direction alternates, flowing back and
forth in the circuit; this means that the voltage alternates as well, constantly changing from maximum to
minimum. Three-phase power combines the three wires to offset the maximum and minimum oscillations,
so that a device receiving this type of power does not experience such a wide variation in voltage. This
makes three-phase power a very efficient form of electrical power distribution. Consequently, a three-
phase electric motor uses less electricity and normally lasts longer than a single-phase motor of the same
voltage and rating. This chapter describes a three-phase system with star and delta connections and
explains how power is calculated.

268 _ Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

19.1 Introduction

Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
via the National Grid system is accomplished by three-
phase alternating currents.

Figure 19.1

The voltage induced by a single coil when rotated in
a uniform magnetic field is shown in Figure 19.1 and
is known as a single-phase voltage. Most consumers
are fed by means of a single-phase a.c. supply. Two
wires are used, one called the live conductor (usually
coloured red) and the other is called the neutral con-
ductor (usually coloured black). The neutral is usually
connected via protective gear to earth, the earth wire
being coloured green. The standard voltage for a single-
phase a.c. supply is 240 V. The majority of single-phase
supplies are obtained by connection to a three-phase
supply (see Figure 19.5, page 269).

19.2 Three-phase supply

A three-phase supply is generated when three coils are
placed 120° apart and the whole rotated in a uniform
magnetic field as shown in Figure 19.2(a). The result is
three independent supplies of equal voltages which are
each displaced by 120° from each other, as shown in
Figure 19.2(b).

Figure 19.2

Gj) The convention adopted to identify each of the
phase voltages is: R — red, Y — yellow, and B —
blue, as shown in Figure 19.2.

(ii) The phase-sequence is given by the sequence in
which the conductors pass the point initially taken
by the red conductor. The national standard phase
sequence is R, Y, B.

A three-phase a.c. supply is carried by three conduc-
tors, called ‘lines’ which are coloured red, yellow and
blue. The currents in these conductors are known as
line currents (J;,) and the p.d.s between them are known
as line voltages (V,). A fourth conductor, called the
neutral (coloured black, and connected through pro-
tective devices to earth) is often used with a three-phase
supply.

If the three-phase windings shown in Figure 19.2 are
kept independent then six wires are needed to connect a
supply source (such as a generator) to a load (such as a
motor). To reduce the number of wires it is usual to inter-
connect the three phases. There are two ways in which
this can be done, these being: (a) a star connection,
and (b) a delta, or mesh, connection. Sources of three-
phase supplies, i.e. alternators, are usually connected in
star, whereas three-phase transformer windings, motors
and other loads may be connected either in star or delta.

19.3 Star connection

(i) A-star-connected load is shown in Figure 19.3,
where the three line conductors are each con-
nected to a load and the outlets from the loads
are joined together at N to form what is termed
the neutral point or the star point.

Figure 19.3

(ii) The voltages, Vr, Vy and Vz are called phase
voltages or line to neutral voltages. Phase volt-
ages are generally denoted by Vp

(iii) The voltages, Vry, Vyg and Vgp are called line
voltages.

(iv) From Figure 19.3 it can be seen that the phase
currents (generally denoted by I) are equal to
their respective line currents Ip, Ty and Ip, i.e.
for a star connection:

Three-phase systems 269

(v)

(vi)

(vii)

For a balanced system:

IrR=Ily =Ip, Vr=Vy=VsB

Vry=Vysp= Var, ZR=Zy=ZB

and the current in the neutral conductor, [yy =0.
When a star-connected system is balanced, then
the neutral conductor is unnecessary and is often
omitted.

The line voltage, Vey, shown in Figure 19.4(a) is
given by Vry =Vr—Vy (Vy is negative since it
is in the opposite direction to Vry). In the phasor
diagram of Figure 19.4(b), phasor Vy is reversed
(shown by the broken line) and then added
phasorially to Vp (i.e. Vry =Vr+(—Vy)). By
trigonometry, or by measurement, Vay=./3Vr,
i.e. for a balanced star connection:

a supply, together with a neutral conductor,
allows the use of two voltages — the phase volt-
age and the line voltage. A four-wire system
is also used when the load is not balanced.
The standard electricity supply to consumers
in Great Britain is 415/240 V, 50Hz, three-
phase, four-wire alternating current A diagram
of connections is shown in Figure 19.5.

For most of the twentieth century, the sup-
ply voltage in the UK in domestic premises
has been 240 V a.c. (r.m.s.) at 50 Hz. In 1988,
a European-wide agreement was reached to
change the various national voltages, which
ranged at the time from 220V to 240V, to a
common European standard of 230 V.

As aresult, the standard nominal supply voltage

the UK has been 230 V since 1995. However,
as an interim measure, electricity suppliers can
work with an asymmetric voltage tolerance of
230 V +10%/—6% (i.e. 216.2 V to 253 V). The
old standard was 240V+6% (i.e. 225.6 V to
254.4 V), which is mostly contained within the
new range, and so in practice suppliers have had
no reason to actually change voltages.
Similarly, the three-phase voltage in the UK
had been for many years 415 V + 6% (i.e. 390 V
to 440V). European harmonization required
this to be changed to 400 V +10%/—6% (i.e.
376 V to 440 V). Again, since the present supply
voltage of 415 V lies within this range, supply
companies are unlikely to reduce their voltages
in the near future.

Many of the calculations following are based
on the 240 V/415 V supply voltages which have
applied for many years and are likely to continue
to do so.

Problem 1. Three loads, each of resistance 30 Q,
are connected in star to a 415 V, three-phase supply.
Determine (a) the system phase voltage, (b) the
phase current and (c) the line current.

A ‘415 V, three-phase supply’ means that 415 V is the

Problem 2. A star-connected load consists of
three identical coils each of resistance 30 Q and
inductance 127.3 mH. If the line current is 5.08 A,
calculate the line voltage if the supply frequency is

Procedure to construct the phasor diagram:

G) Draw Vye=Vy =Vg=240V and spaced 120°
apart. (Note that Vp is shown vertically upwards —
this, however, is immaterial for it may be drawn
in any direction.)

(ii) Power factor=cos ¢=0.966 lagging. Hence the
load phase angle is given by cos! 0.966, i.e. 15°
lagging. Hence Ip = ly =Ip=5A, lagging Vr,
Vy and Vz, respectively, by 15°

(ii) Vry=Vr—Vy (phasorially). Hence Vy is
reversed and added phasorially to Vr. By
measurement, Vay=415V (ie. ./3(240)) and
leads Vr by 30°. Similarly, Vyg= Vy — Vg and
Var=VBa—Vr

19.5 Power in three-phase systems

The power dissipated in a three-phase load is given by
the sum of the power dissipated in each phase. If a
load is balanced then the total power P is given by:
P =3 x power consumed by one phase.

19.6 Measurement of power
in three-phase systems

Power in three-phase loads may be measured by the
following methods:

(i) One-wattmeter method for a balanced load

Wattmeter connections for both star and delta are
shown in Figure 19.12.

Total power = 3 x wattmeter reading

Current coil

Figure 19.12
(ii) Two-wattmeter method for balanced or unbal-
anced loads

A connection diagram for this method is shown
in Figure 19.13 for a star-connected load. Similar
connections are made for a delta-connected load.

Total power =sum of wattmeter readings

Wattmeter 1

Wattmeter 2

The power factor may be determined from:

It is possible, depending on the load power factor,
for one wattmeter to have to be ‘reversed’ to obtain a
reading. In this case it is taken as a negative reading
(see worked Problem 17).

(see Problems
12 and 15 to 18)

(iii) Three-wattmeter method for a_ three-phase,
four-wire system for balanced and unbalanced
loads (see Figure 19.14).

Thus, p=erirg+eyiy +ep(—iz—iy)

However, (er — eg) is the p.d. across wattmeter 1

wattmeter 2.

Hence total instantaneous power,

The moving systems of the wattmeters are unable
to follow the variations which take place at
normal frequencies and they indicate the mean

7 Comparison of star

and delta connections

Loads connected in delta dissipate three times
more power than when connected in star to the
same supply.

For the same power, the phase currents must be
the same for both delta and star connections (since

Three-phase systems

power= 31; R,), hence the line current in the
delta-connected system is greater than the line
current in the corresponding — star-connected
system. To achieve the same phase current in a
star-connected system as in a delta-connected sys-
tem, the line voltage in the star system is ./3 times
the line voltage in the delta system.

Thus for a given power transfer, a delta system is
associated with larger line currents (and thus larger
conductor cross-sectional area) and a star system
is associated with a larger line voltage (and thus
greater insulation).

For a given amount of power transmitted through
a system, the three-phase system requires con-
ductors with a smaller cross-sectional area. This
means a saving of copper (or aluminium) and thus
the original installation costs are less.

Two voltages are available (see Section 19.3(vii)).

Three-phase motors are very robust, relatively
cheap, generally smaller, have self-starting prop-
erties, provide a steadier output and require little

Transformers

The transformer is one of the simplest of electrical devices. Its basic design, materials, and principles have
changed little over the last 100 years, yet transformer designs and materials continue to be improved.
Transformers are essential in high-voltage power transmission, providing an economical means of trans-
mitting power over large distances. A major application of transformers is to increase voltage before
transmitting electrical energy over long distances through cables. Cables have resistance and so dissipate
electrical energy. By transforming electrical power to a high-voltage, and therefore low-current form, for
transmission and back again afterwards, transformers enable economical transmission of power over
long distances. Consequently, transformers have shaped the electricity supply industry, permitting gen-
eration to be located remotely from points of demand. All but a tiny fraction of the world’s electrical
power has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer. Transformers
are also used extensively in electronic products to step down the supply voltage to a level suitable for the
low-voltage circuits they contain. The transformer also electrically isolates the end user from contact with
the supply voltage. Signal and audio transformers are used to couple stages of amplifiers and to match
devices such as microphones and record players to the input of amplifiers. Audio transformers allowed
telephone circuits to carry on a two-way conversation over a single pair of wires. This chapter explains
the principle of operation of a transformer, its construction and associated calculations, including losses
and efficiency. Resistance matching, the auto transformer, the three-phase transformer and current and
voltage transformers are also discussed.

Transformers 281

20.1 Introduction

A transformer is a device which uses the phenomenon
of mutual induction (see Chapter 9) to change the values
of alternating voltages and currents. In fact, one of the
main advantages of a.c. transmission and distribution
is the ease with which an alternating voltage can be
increased or decreased by transformers.

Losses in transformers are generally low and thus
efficiency is high. Being static, they have a long life and
are very stable.

Transformers range in size from the miniature units
used in electronic applications to the large power
transformers used in power stations. The principle of
operation is the same for each.

A transformer is represented in Figure 20.1(a)
as consisting of two electrical circuits linked by a
common ferromagnetic core. One coil is termed the
primary winding, which is connected to the supply

of electricity, and the other the secondary wind-
ing, which may be connected to a load. A cir-
cuit diagram symbol for a transformer is shown in
Figure 20.1(b).

20.2 Transformer principle

of operation

When the secondary is an open-circuit and an alternating
voltage V, is applied to the primary winding, a small
current — called the no-load current Jo — flows, which
sets up a magnetic flux in the core. This alternating flux
links with both primary and secondary coils and induces
in them e.m.f.s of E, and FE, respectively, by mutual
induction.

The induced e.m.f. FE in a coil of N turns is given by

d®
E=-—N— volts,
dt

where d@®/dt is the rate of change of flux. In an ideal
transformer, the rate of change of flux is the same for
both primary and secondary and thus EF, /N; = E2/N2,
i.e. the induced e.m.f. per turn is constant.
Assuming no losses, E; = V; and E2 = V2. Hence

V| / V2 is called the voltage ratio and N; /N2 the turns
ratio, or the ‘transformation ratio’ of the transformer.
If N> is less than Nj; then V> is less than V; and the
device is termed a step-down transformer. If N2 is
greater then Nj then V2 is greater than Vj and the device
is termed a step-up transformer.

When a load is connected across the secondary wind-
ing, acurrent Jp flows. In an ideal transformer losses are
neglected and a transformer is considered to be 100%
efficient.


282 _ Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

Hence input power = output power, or Vj J, = Voh,
i.e. in an ideal transformer, the primary and secondary
volt-amperes are equal.

The rating of a transformer is stated in terms of the
volt-amperes that it can transform without overheating.
With reference to Figure 20. 1(a), the transformer rating
is either V; J; or V2 12, where /2 is the full load secondary
current.

Problem 1. A transformer has 500 primary turns
and 3000 secondary turns. If the primary voltage is
240 V, determine the secondary voltage, assuming
an ideal transformer.

For an ideal transformer, voltage ratio = turns ratio, i.e.

Thus secondary voltage V2 = (3000) (240)

Problem 2. An ideal transformer with a turns
ratio of 2:7 is fed from a 240 V supply. Determine
its output voltage.

A turns ratio of 2:7 means that the transformer has 2
turns on the primary for every 7 turns on the secondary
(i.e. a step-up transformer). Thus,

supplied at 240 V. Calculate the secondary voltage

(i) The core flux is common to both primary and sec-
ondary windings in a transformer and is thus taken
as the reference phasor in a phasor diagram. On
no-load the primary winding takes a small no-
load current Jp and since, with losses neglected,
the primary winding is a pure inductor, this cur-
rent lags the applied voltage V; by 90°. In the
phasor diagram, assuming no losses, shown in
Figure 20.2(a), current Jo produces the flux and is
drawn in phase with the flux. The primary induced
e.m.f. E; is in phase opposition to V; (by Lenz’s

Let ®,, be the maximum value of the flux and f be

The flux rises sinusoidally from zero to its maximum

value in i cycle, and the time for i cycle is 1/4f

If the voltage drop in the windings of a transformer are
assumed negligible, then the terminal voltage V2 is the
same as the induced e.m.f. Ez in the secondary. Simi-
larly, Vj = E;. Assuming an equal number of turns on
primary and secondary windings, then E; = E2, and let
the load have a lagging phase angle ¢2

In the phasor diagram of Figure 20.4, current J lags
V2 by angle #2. When a load is connected across the
secondary winding a current J) flows in the secondary
winding. The resulting secondary e.m.f. acts so as to
tend to reduce the core flux. However this does not hap-
pen since reduction of the core flux reduces EF), hence
a reflected increase in primary current J} occurs which
provides a restoring mmf. Hence at all loads, primary
and secondary mmfs are equal, but in opposition, and
the core flux remains constant. J; is sometimes called
the ‘balancing’ current and is equal, but in the opposite
direction, to current /2, as shown in Figure 20.4. Io,
shown at a phase angle ¢o to V1, is the no-load current
of the transformer (see Section 20.3).

reactances of the primary and secondary windings, due
to leakage flux.

The core losses due to hysteresis and eddy currents are
allowed for by resistance R which takes a current Jc, the
core loss component of the primary current. Reactance
X takes the magnetizing component Ijy

In a simplified equivalent circuit shown in Figure 20.8,
R and X are omitted since the no-load current Jp is
normally only about 3-5% of the full load primary
current.

It is often convenient to assume that all of the resistance
and reactance is on one side of the transformer.
Resistance R2 in Figure 20.8 can be replaced by insert-
ing an additional resistance R4 in the primary circuit
such that the power absorbed in R4 when carrying
the primary current is equal to that in R2 due to
the secondary current, i.e. J PRs = IZ Ro from which,

20.8 Regulation of a transformer

When the secondary of a transformer is loaded, the sec-
ondary terminal voltage, V2, falls. As the power factor
decreases, this voltage drop increases. This is called
the regulation of the transformer and it is usually
expressed as a percentage of the secondary no-load
voltage, 2. For full-load conditions:

E,-V2
2

Regulation= ( ) x 100% (10)

The fall in voltage, (E2 — V2), is caused by the resistance
and reactance of the windings.

Typical values of voltage regulation are about 3% in
small transformers and about 1% in large transformers.

Problem 14. A5kVA, 200 V/400 V, single-phase
transformer has a secondary terminal voltage of
387.6 volts when loaded. Determine the regulation

20.9 Transformer losses

and efficiency

There are broadly two sources of losses in transformers
on load, these being copper losses and iron losses.

(a) Copper losses are variable and result in a heating
of the conductors, due to the fact that they possess
resistance. If Rj and R2 are the primary and sec-
ondary winding resistances then the total copper
loss is TPR + IZ Ro

(b) Iron losses are constant for a given value of fre-
quency and flux density and are of two types —
hysteresis loss and eddy current loss.

(i) Hysteresis loss is the heating of the core
as a result of the internal molecular struc-
ture reversals which occur as the magnetic
flux alternates. The loss is proportional to the
area of the hysteresis loop and thus low loss
nickel iron alloys are used for the core since
their hysteresis loops have small areas. (See
Chapters 7 and 38)

(ii) Eddy current loss is the heating of the
core due to e.m.f.s being induced not only
in the transformer windings but also in the
core. These induced e.m.f.s set up circulat-
ing currents, called eddy currents. Owing to
the low resistance of the core, eddy currents
can be quite considerable and can cause a
large power loss and excessive heating of the
core. Eddy current losses can be reduced by
increasing the resistivity of the core material
or, more usually, by laminating the core

(i.e. splitting it into layers or leaves) when
very thin layers of insulating material can
be inserted between each pair of laminations.
This increases the resistance of the eddy cur-
rent path, and reduces the value of the eddy
current.

Problem 17. Determine the efficiency of the
transformer in worked Problem 16 at half full load
and 0.85 power factor.

squared.

Hence the copper loss at half full load is

(4)? (1500) = 375 W

Iron loss = 1000 W (constant)

Total losses = 375 + 1000 = 1375 W or 1.375 kW

20.10 Resistance matching

Varying a load resistance to be equal, or almost equal,
to the source internal resistance is called match-
ing. Examples where resistance matching is important
include coupling an aerial to a transmitter or receiver,
or in coupling a loudspeaker to an amplifier, where cou-
pling transformers may be used to give maximum power
transfer.

With d.c. generators or secondary cells, the internal
resistance is usually very small. In such cases, if an
attempt is made to make the load resistance as small as
the source internal resistance, overloading of the source
results.


294 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

A method of achieving maximum power trans-
fer between a source and a load (see Section 13.9,
page 184), is to adjust the value of the load resis-
tance to ‘match’ the source internal resistance. A
transformer may be used as a resistance matching
device by connecting it between the load and the
source.

The reason why a transformer can be used for this is
shown below. With reference to Figure 20.10:

20.11 Auto transformers

An auto transformer is a transformer which has part
of its winding common to the primary and secondary
circuits. Figure 20.14(a) shows the circuit for a double-
wound transformer and Figure 20.14(b) that for an
auto transformer. The latter shows that the secondary
is actually part of the primary, the current in the sec-
ondary being (2—1/;). Since the current is less in
this section, the cross-sectional area of the winding
can be reduced, which reduces the amount of material
necessary.

Saving of copper in an auto transformer

For the same output and voltage ratio, the auto trans-
former requires less copper than an ordinary double-
wound transformer. This is explained below.

The volume, and hence weight, of copper required
in a winding is proportional to the number of turns and
to the cross-sectional area of the wire. In turn, this is
proportional to the current to be carried, i.e. volume of
copper is proportional to NJ

1. A single-phase auto transformer has a volt-
age ratio of 480 V:300 V and supplies a load
of 30kVA at 300 V. Assuming an ideal trans-
former, calculate the current in each section of
the winding.

copper used in an auto transformer com-
pared with a double-wound transformer for
(a) a 300V:240V transformer, and (b) a
400 V:100 V transformer.

Advantages of auto transformers

The advantages of auto transformers over double-wound
transformers include:

1. a saving in cost since less copper is needed (see
above)

2. less volume, hence less weight
3. ahigher efficiency, resulting from lower J” R losses

4. acontinuously variable output voltage is achievable
if a sliding contact is used

5. asmaller percentage voltage regulation.

Disadvantages of auto transformers

The primary and secondary windings are not electrically
separate, hence if an open-circuit occurs in the sec-
ondary winding the full primary voltage appears across
the secondary.

298 _ Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

Uses of auto transformers

Auto transformers are used for reducing the volt-
age when starting induction motors (see Chapter 22)
and for interconnecting systems that are operating at
approximately the same voltage.

20.12 Isolating transformers

Transformers not only enable current or voltage to be
transformed to some different magnitude, but provide a
means of isolating electrically one part of a circuit from
another when there is no electrical connection between
primary and secondary windings. An isolating trans-
former is a 1:1 ratio transformer with several impor-
tant applications, including bathroom shaver-sockets,
portable electric tools, model railways and so on.

20.13 Three-phase transformers

Three-phase, double-wound transformers are mainly
used in power transmission and are usually of the core
type. They basically consist of three pairs of single-
phase windings mounted on one core, as shown in
Figure 20.17, which gives a considerable saving in the
amount of iron used. The primary and secondary wind-
ings in Figure 20.17 are wound on top of each other in
the form of concentric cylinders, similar to that shown
in Figure 20.6(a). The windings may be with the pri-
mary delta-connected and the secondary star-connected,
or star—delta, star—-star or delta—delta, depending on its
use.

20.14 Current transformers

For measuring currents in excess of about 100 A, a cur-
rent transformer is normally used. With a d.c. moving-
coil ammeter the current required to give full-scale
deflection is very small — typically a few milliamperes.
When larger currents are to be measured a shunt resistor
is added to the circuit (see Chapter 10). However, even
with shunt resistors added it is not possible to measure
very large currents. When a.c. is being measured a shunt
cannot be used since the proportion of the current which
flows in the meter will depend on its impedance, which
varies with frequency.

N2 200
Current transformers isolate the ammeter from the main
circuit and allow the use of a standard range of ammeters
giving full-scale deflections of 1 A, 2A or 5A.

For very large currents the transformer core can be
mounted around the conductor or bus-bar. Thus the pri-
mary then has just one turn. It is very important to
short-circuit the secondary winding before removing the
ammeter. This is because if current is flowing in the pri-
mary, dangerously high voltages could be induced in the
secondary should it be open-circuited.

Current transformer circuit diagram symbols are shown
in Figure 20.20.

is often safer to use a voltage transformer. These
are normal double-wound transformers with a large

to a high voltage supply, and a small number of turns

on the secondary. A typical arrangement is shown in

D.c. machines

A machine which converts d.c. electrical power into mechanical power is known as a d.c. motor. A machine
which converts mechanical power into electrical power is called a d.c. generator. From a construction
point of view there is no difference between a d.c. motor and generator. D.c. motors have been available
for nearly 100 years; in fact the first electric motors were designed and built for operation from direct
current power. D.c. motors have a wide speed range, good speed regulation, compact size and light weight
(relative to mechanical variable speed), ease of control, low maintenance and low cost. The armature
and field in a d.c. motor can be connected three different ways to provide varying amounts of torque
or different types of speed control. The armature and field windings are designed slightly differently for
different types of d.c. motors. The three basic types of d.c. motors are the series motor, the shunt motor
and the compound motor. The series motor is designed to move large loads with high starting torque in
applications such as a crane motor or lift hoist. The shunt motor is designed slightly differently, since it is
made for applications such as pumping fluids, where constant-speed characteristics are important. The
compound motor is designed with some of the series motor’s characteristics and some of the shunt motor’s
characteristics. This allows the compound motor to be used in applications where high starting torque
and controlled operating speed are both required. In this chapter, types of d.c. motor and generator are
described, together with associated calculations. The motor starter and methods of speed control are also
considered.

21.1 Introduction

When the input to an electrical machine is electrical
energy (seen as applying a voltage to the electrical
terminals of the machine), and the output is mechan-
ical energy (seen as a rotating shaft), the machine is
called an electric motor. Thus an electric motor converts
electrical energy into mechanical energy.

The principle of operation of a motor is explained in
Section 8.4, page 88.

When the input to an electrical machine is mechan-
ical energy (seen as, say, a diesel motor, coupled to
the machine by a shaft), and the output is electrical
energy (seen as a voltage appearing at the electrical
terminals of the machine), the machine is called a gen-
erator. Thus, a generator converts mechanical energy
to electrical energy.

The principle of operation of a generator is explained in
Section 9.2, page 92.

21.2 The action of a commutator

In an electric motor, conductors rotate in a uniform mag-
netic field. A single-loop conductor mounted between
permanent magnets is shown in Figure 21.1. A voltage
is applied at points A and B in Figure 21.1(a).

A force, F, acts on the loop due to the interaction
of the magnetic field of the permanent magnets and the
magnetic field created by the current flowing in the loop.
This force is proportional to the flux density, B, the cur-
rent flowing, J, and the effective length of the conductor,
l, i.e. F =BIl. The force is made up of two parts, one
acting vertically downwards due to the current flowing
from C to D and the other acting vertically upwards
due to the current flowing from E to F (from Fleming’s
left-hand rule). If the loop is free to rotate, then when it
has rotated through 180°, the conductors are as shown
in Figure 21.1(b). For rotation to continue in the same

(a)
4
Axis of
rotation
(b}
rotation
Figure 21.1

direction, it is necessary for the current flow to be as
shown in Figure 21.1(b), i.e. from D to C and from
F to E. This apparent reversal in the direction of cur-
rent flow is achieved by a process called commutation.
With reference to Figure 21.2(a), when a direct voltage
is applied at A and B, then as the single-loop conduc-
tor rotates, current flow will always be away from the
commutator for the part of the conductor adjacent to the
N-pole and towards the commutator for the part of the
conductor adjacent to the S-pole. Thus the forces act to
give continuous rotation in an anticlockwise direction.
The arrangement shown in Figure 21.2(a) is called a
‘two-segment’ commutator and the voltage is applied
to the rotating segments by stationary brushes (usually
carbon blocks), which slide on the commutator material
(usually copper), when rotation takes place.

In practice, there are many conductors on the rotating
part of a d.c. machine and these are attached to many

commutator segments. A schematic diagram of a multi-
segment commutator is shown in Figure 21.2(b).

Poor commutation results in sparking at the trailing
edge of the brushes. This can be improved by using
interpoles (situated between each pair of main poles),
high resistance brushes, or using brushes spanning
several commutator segments.

21.3 D.c. machine construction

Figure 21.3, and comprise:

(ii) the magnetic poles, around which are the

ductor wound round the pole core; current
passing through this conductor creates an
electromagnet (rather than the permanent
magnets shown in Figures 21.1 and 21.2).

loop conductor system and

(vi) the commutator (see Section 21.2).

Armature windings can be divided into two groups,
depending on how the wires are joined to the com-
mutator. These are called wave windings and lap
windings.

(a) In wave windings there are two paths in par-
allel, irrespective of the number of poles, each
path supplying half the total current output. Wave-
wound generators produce high-voltage, low-
current outputs.

(b) Inlap windings there are as many paths in parallel
as the machine has poles. The total current output
divides equally between them. Lap-wound gener-
ators produce high-current, low-voltage output.

21.4 Shunt, series and compound

windings

When the field winding of ad.c. machine is connected in
parallel with the armature, as shown in Figure 21.4(a),
the machine is said to be shunt wound. If the field
winding is connected in series with the armature, as
shown in Figure 21.4(b), then the machine is said to
be series wound. A compound wound machine has a
combination of series and shunt windings.

Depending on whether the electrical machine is series
wound, shunt wound or compound wound, it behaves
differently when a load is applied. The behaviour of
a d.c. machine under various conditions is shown by
means of graphs, called characteristic curves or just

the change in the generated voltage when the field

21.6 D.c. generators

D.c. generators are classified according to the method
of their field excitation. These groupings are:

(i) Separately excited generators, where the field
winding is connected to a source of supply other
than the armature of its own machine.

(ii) Self-excited generators, where the field wind-
ing receives its supply from the armature of its
own machine, and which are sub-divided into
(a) shunt, (b) series and (c) compound wound
generators.

Characteristics

The two principal generator characteristics are the
generated voltage/field current characteristics, called
the open-circuit characteristic and the terminal
voltage/load current characteristic, called the load
characteristic. A typical separately excited generator
open-circuit characteristic is shown in Figure 21.6(a)
and a typical load characteristic is shown in
Figure 21.6(b).

A separately excited generator is used only in special
cases, such as when a wide variation in terminal p.d. is
required, or when exact control of the field current is
necessary. Its disadvantage lies in requiring a separate
source of direct current.

(b) Shunt-wound generator

In a shunt-wound generator the field winding is con-
nected in parallel with the armature, as shown in
Figure 21.7. The field winding has a relatively high resis-
tance and therefore the current carried is only a fraction

of the armature current.

Characteristics

The generated e.m.f., E, is proportional to Bw (see
Section 21.5), hence at constant speed, since @=2zn,
E«®. Also the flux ® is proportional to field current
Ty until magnetic saturation of the iron circuit of the
generator occurs. Hence the open circuit characteristic
is as shown in Figure 21.9(a).

Figure 21.9

As the load current on a generator having constant
field current and running at constant speed increases, the
value of armature current increases, hence the armature
volt drop, J, R, increases. The generated voltage E is
larger than the terminal voltage V and the voltage equa-
tion for the armature circuit is V = E—J,R,. Since E
is constant, V decreases with increasing load. The load
characteristic is as shown in Figure 21.9(b). In practice,
the fall in voltage is about 10% between no-load and
full-load for many d.c. shunt-wound generators.

The shunt-wound generator is the type most used
in practice, but the load current must be limited to a
value that is well below the maximum value. This then
avoids excessive variation of the terminal voltage. Typi-
cal applications are with battery charging and motor car
generators.

(c) Series-wound generator

In the series-wound generator the field winding is
connected in series with the armature as shown in
Figure 21.10.

Field

Figure 21.10

Characteristics

The load characteristic is the terminal voltage/current
characteristic. The generated e.m.f., FE, is proportional
to Ow and at constant speed w(=2zn) is a constant.
Thus £E is proportional to ®. For values of current
below magnetic saturation of the yoke, poles, air gaps
and armature core, the flux ® is proportional to the
current, hence E «J. For values of current above those
required for magnetic saturation, the generated e.m.f. is
approximately constant. The values of field resistance
and armature resistance in a series-wound machine are
small, hence the terminal voltage V is very nearly equal
to E. A typical load characteristic for a series generator
is shown in Figure 21.11.

In a series-wound generator, the field winding is in
series with the armature and it is not possible to have
a value of field current when the terminals are open
circuited, thus it is not possible to obtain an open-circuit
characteristic.

Series-wound generators are rarely used in practice,
but can be used as a ‘booster’ on d.c. transmission lines.

(d) Compound-wound generator

In the compound-wound generator two methods of con-
nection are used, both having a mixture of shunt and
series windings, designed to combine the advantages
of each. Figure 21.12(a) shows what is termed a long-
shunt compound generator, and Figure 21.12(b) shows
a Short-shunt compound generator. The latter is the
most generally used form of d.c. generator.

Characteristics

In cumulative-compound machines the magnetic flux
produced by the series and shunt fields are additive.
Included in this group are over-compounded, level-
compounded and under-compounded machines — the
degree of compounding obtained depending on the
number of turns of wire on the series winding.

A large number of series winding turns results
in an over-compounded characteristic, as shown in
Figure 21.14, in which the full-load terminal volt-
age exceeds the no-load voltage. A level-compound
machine gives a full-load terminal voltage which is
equal to the no-load voltage, as shown in Figure 21.14.

An under-compounded machine gives a full-load
terminal voltage which is less than the no-load voltage,

characteristic is a little better than that for a shunt
generator alone.

Compound-wound generators are used in electric arc
welding, with lighting sets and with marine equipment.

21.8 D.c. machine losses

As stated in Section 21.1, a generator is a machine for
converting mechanical energy into electrical energy and
amotor is amachine for converting electrical energy into
mechanical energy. When such conversions take place,
certain losses occur which are dissipated in the form
of heat.

The principal losses of machines are:

(i) Copper loss, due to /?R heat losses in the
armature and field windings.

(ii) Iron (or core) loss, due to hysteresis and eddy-
current losses in the armature. This loss can be
reduced by constructing the armature of silicon
steel laminations having a high resistivity and low
hysteresis loss. At constant speed, the iron loss is
assumed constant.

(iii) Friction and windage losses, due to bearing and
brush contact friction and losses due to air resis-
tance against moving parts (called windage). At
constant speed, these losses are assumed to be
constant.

(iv) Brush contact loss between the brushes and com-
mutator. This loss is approximately proportional
to the load current.

The total losses of a machine can be quite significant
and operating efficiencies of between 80% and 90% are
common.

21.9 Efficiency of ad.c. generator

The efficiency of an electrical machine is the ratio of the
output power to the input power and is usually expressed
as a percentage. The Greek letter ‘7’ (eta) is used to
signify efficiency and since the units are power/power,
then efficiency has no units. Thus

tput
efficiency, 7 = (ee) x 100%

input power

If the total resistance of the armature circuit (including
brush contact resistance) is R,, then the total loss in
the armature circuit is I 2Ra

If the terminal voltage is V and the current in the
shunt circuit is J, then the loss in the shunt circuit is
TV

If the sum of the iron, friction and windage losses is C
then the total losses is given by:

PRa +1pV + Cc
(2 Ra + If V is, in fact, the “copper loss’)

If the output current is 7, then the output power is VI.

21.10 D.c. motors

The construction of a d.c. motor is the same as a d.c.
generator. The only difference is that in a generator the
generated e.m.f. is greater than the terminal voltage,
whereas in a motor the generated e.m.f. is less than the
terminal voltage.

D.c. motors are often used in power stations to
drive emergency stand-by pump systems which come
into operation to protect essential equipment and plant
should the normal a.c. supplies or pumps fail.

Back e.m.f.

When a d.c. motor rotates, an e.m.f. is induced in the
armature conductors. By Lenz’s law this induced e.m.f.
E opposes the supply voltage V and is called a back
e.m.f., and the supply voltage V is given by:

V=E+I,R, or E=V-1,R, (5)

Problem 13. A d.c. motor operates from a 240 V
supply. The armature resistance is 0.2 Q. Determine
the back e.m.f. when the armature current is 50 A.
For a motor, V=E+I1gRa

Characteristics

The two principal characteristics are the torque/
armature current and speed/armature current relation-
ships. From these, the torque/speed relationship can be
derived.

(i) The theoretical torque/armature current char-
acteristic can be derived from the expression
T x J, (see Section 21.11). For a shunt-wound
motor, the field winding is connected in paral-
lel with the armature circuit and thus the applied
voltage gives a constant field current, i.e. a shunt-
wound motor is a constant flux machine. Since

D.c. machines

® is constant, it follows that T «J,, and the
characteristic is as shown in Figure 21.17.

(ii) The armature circuit of a d.c. motor has resis-
tance due to the armature winding and brushes,
Ra ohms, and when armature current J, is flow-
ing through it, there is a voltage drop of Ig Ra
volts. In Figure 21.16 the armature resistance is
shown as a separate resistor in the armature cir-
cuit to help understanding. Also, even though
the machine is a motor, because conductors are
rotating in a magnetic field, a voltage, Ex Da,
is generated by the armature conductors. From

For a shunt motor, V, ® and R, are constants,
hence as armature current J, increases, I, Rg
increases and V — J, Rg decreases, and the speed
is proportional to a quantity which is decreas-
ing and is as shown in Figure 21.18. As the
load on the shaft of the motor increases, [,
increases and the speed drops slightly. In prac-
tice, the speed falls by about 10% between
no-load and full-load on many d.c. shunt-wound
motors. Due to this relatively small drop in

as basically being a constant-speed machine
and may be used for driving lathes, lines of
shafts, fans, conveyor belts, pumps, compres-
sors, drilling machines and so on.

rent (see (1) above), the theoretical speed/torque
characteristic is as shown in Figure 21.19.

Problem 21. A 200V d.c. shunt-wound motor
has an armature resistance of 0.4 Q and at a certain
load has an armature current of 30 A and runs at
1350 rev/min. If the load on the shaft of the motor is
increased so that the armature current increases to
45 A, determine the speed of the motor, assuming
the flux remains constant.

The relationship E « ®n applies to both generators and
motors. For a motor,

E=V — 1,R, (see equation 5)

Thus the speed of the motor when the armature current
is 45 A is 21.78 x 60 rev/min, i.e. 1307 rev/min.

Problem 22. A 220V d.c. shunt-wound motor
runs at 800 rev/min and the armature current is
30A. The armature circuit resistance is 0.4Q.

Determine (a) the maximum value of armature
current if the flux is suddenly reduced by 10% and
(b) the steady state value of the armature current at
the new value of flux, assuming the shaft torque of
the motor remains constant.

(a) For a d.c. shunt-wound motor, E=V —J,Rg,.

Hence initial generated e.m.f., E; =220 —300.4

E«x@®n, so at the instant the flux is reduced,
the speed has not had time to change, and
E=208 x 90/100 = 187.2 V.
Hence, the voltage drop due to the armature
resistance is 220 — 187.2, i.e. 32.8 V. The instan-
taneous value of the current is 32.8/0.4, i.e.
82 A. This increase in current is about three times
the initial value and causes an increase in torque,
(T «x ®J,). The motor accelerates because of the
larger torque value until steady state conditions are
reached.

A d.c. series motor takes a large current

Hence these motors are used for traction (such
as trains, milk delivery vehicles, etc.), driving
fans and for cranes and hoists, where a large
initial torque is required.

Problem 23. A series motor has an armature
resistance of 0.2 Q and a series field resistance of
0.3 Q. It is connected to a 240 V supply and at a
particular load runs at 24 rev/s when drawing 15 A
from the supply.

(a) Determine the generated e.m-f. at this load.

(b) Calculate the speed of the motor when the

As the current has been increased from 15A

(c) Compound-wound motor

There are two types of compound-wound motor:

(i) Cumulative compound, in which the series
winding is so connected that the field due to it
assists that due to the shunt winding.

Gi) Differential compound, in which the series
winding is so connected that the field due to it

Characteristics

A compound-wound motor has both a series and a shunt
field winding (i.e. one winding in series and one in par-
allel with the armature), and is usually wound to have a

characteristic similar in shape to a series-wound motor
(see Figures 21.21—21.23). A limited amount of shunt
winding is present to restrict the no-load speed to a safe
value. However, by varying the number of turns on the
series and shunt windings and the directions of the mag-
netic fields produced by these windings (assisting or
opposing), families of characteristics may be obtained
to suit almost all applications. Generally, compound-
wound motors are used for heavy duties, particularly
in applications where sudden heavy load may occur,
such as for driving plunger pumps, presses, geared lifts,
conveyors, hoists and so on.

the flux per pole is proportional to the current
flowing, find the current and speed at half
full load torque, when connected to the same

supply.

21.14 D.c. motor starter

If ad.c. motor whose armature is stationary is switched
directly to its supply voltage, it is likely that the fuses
protecting the motor will burn out. This is because the
armature resistance is small, frequently being less than
one ohm. Thus, additional resistance must be added to
the armature circuit at the instant of closing the switch
to start the motor.

As the speed of the motor increases, the armature con-
ductors are cutting flux and a generated voltage, acting
in opposition to the applied voltage, is produced, which
limits the flow of armature current. Thus the value of
the additional armature resistance can then be reduced.

When at normal running speed, the generated e.m-f.
is such that no additional resistance is required in the
armature circuit. To achieve this varying resistance in
the armature circuit on starting, a d.c. motor starter is
used, as shown in Figure 21.28.

The starting handle is moved slowly in a clockwise

the field winding is connected to stud | or to L viaa slid-
ing contact on the starting handle, to give maximum field
current, hence maximum flux, hence maximum torque
on starting, since Tx OI,

A similar arrangement without the field connection is
used for series motors.

21.15 Speed control of d.c. motors

Shunt-wound motors

The speed of a shunt-wound d.c. motor, n, is propor-
tional to (V — Ig Ra)/® (see equation (9)). The speed is
varied either by varying the value of flux, ®, or by vary-
ing the value of R,. The former is achieved by using
a variable resistor in series with the field winding, as
shown in Figure 21.29(a) and such a resistor is called
the shunt field regulator. As the value of resistance of
the shunt field regulator is increased, the value of the
field current, Ir, is decreased.

This results in a decrease in the value of flux, ®,
and hence an increase in the speed, since nx 1/®.
Thus only speeds above that given without a shunt
field regulator can be obtained by this method. Speeds
below those given by (V —J,R,)/® are obtained by
increasing the resistance in the armature circuit, as
shown in Figure 21.29(b), where

V —Ia(Ra + R)

reducing the field current, and hence flux, for a
given value of supply current. A circuit diagram
of this arrangement is shown in Figure 21.30(a).
A variable resistor connected in parallel with the
series-wound field to control speed is called a
diverter. Speeds above those given with no diverter
are obtained by this method. Worked Problem 29
below demonstrates this method.

and thus reduces the speed. Since the additional
resistor carries the full supply current, a large
power loss is associated with large motors in which
a considerable speed reduction is required for long

periods. This method is demonstrated in worked
Problem 30.

Problem 29. On full-load a 300 V series motor
takes 90 A and runs at 15 rev/s. The armature

21.16 Motor cooling

Motors are often classified according to the type of
enclosure used, the type depending on the conditions
under which the motor is used and the degree of
ventilation required.

The most common type of protection is the screen-
protected type, where ventilation is achieved by fitting
a fan internally, with the openings at the end of the motor
fitted with wire mesh.

A drip-proof type is similar to the screen-protected
type but has a cover over the screen to prevent drips of
water entering the machine.

A flame-proof type is usually cooled by the conduction
of heat through the motor casing.

With a pipe-ventilated type, air is piped into the motor
from a dust-free area, and an internally fitted fan ensures
the circulation of this cool air.

Three-phase induction
motors

The induction motor is a three-phase a.c. motor and is the most widely used machine in industrial
applications. Its characteristic features are simple and rugged construction, low cost and minimum main-
tenance, high reliability and sufficiently high efficiency, and needs no extra starting motor and need not
be synchronized. An induction motor, also called an asynchronous motor, is an a.c. motor in which all
electromagnetic energy is transferred by inductive coupling from a primary winding to a secondary
winding, the two windings being separated by an air gap. In three-phase induction motors that are inher-
ently self-starting, energy transfer is usually from the stator to either a wound rotor or a short-circuited
squirrel cage rotor. Three-phase cage rotor induction motors are widely used in industrial drives because
they are rugged, reliable and economical. Single-phase induction motors are also used extensively for
smaller loads. Although most a.c. motors have long been used in fixed-speed load drive service, they
are increasingly being used in variable-frequency drive (VFD) service, variable-torque centrifugal fan,
pump and compressor loads being by far the most important energy-saving applications for VFD ser-
vice. Squirrel cage induction motors are most commonly used in both fixed-speed and VFD applications.
This chapter explains the principle of operation of the different types of three-phase induction motors.
Calculations of slip and losses and efficiency are also included. Methods of starting induction motors are
also discussed.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

e appreciate the merits of three-phase induction motors

Three-phase induction motors 325

22.1 Introduction

In d.c. motors, introduced in Chapter 21, conductors on
a rotating armature pass through a stationary magnetic
field. In a three-phase induction motor, the magnetic
field rotates and this has the advantage that no exter-
nal electrical connections to the rotor need be made.
Its name is derived from the fact that the current in the
rotor is induced by the magnetic field instead of being
supplied through electrical connections to the supply.
The result is a motor which: (i) is cheap and robust, (ii) is
explosion proof, due to the absence of a commutator
or slip-rings and brushes with their associated sparking,
(iii) requires little or no skilled maintenance and (iv) has
self-starting properties when switched to a supply with
no additional expenditure on auxiliary equipment. The
principal disadvantage of a three-phase induction motor
is that its speed cannot be readily adjusted.

22.2 Production of a rotating

magnetic field

When a three-phase supply is connected to symmetrical
three-phase windings, the currents flowing in the wind-
ings produce a magnetic field. This magnetic field is
constant in magnitude and rotates at constant speed as
shown below, and is called the synchronous speed.
With reference to Figure 22.1, the windings are
represented by three single-loop conductors, one for
each phase, marked Rs Rr, YsYr and Bs Br, the S and
F signifying start and finish. In practice, each phase
winding comprises many turns and is distributed around
the stator; the single-loop approach is for clarity only. Magnetic p.
When the stator windings are connected to a three- tux (a)
phase supply, the current flowing in each winding varies
with time and is as shown in Figure 22.1 (a). If the value Figure 22.1


326 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

of current in a winding is positive, the assumption is
made that it flows from start to finish of the winding,
ie. if it is the red phase, current flows from Rg to
Rr, i.e. away from the viewer in Rs and towards the
viewer in Ry. When the value of current is negative, the
assumption is made that it flows from finish to start, i.e.
towards the viewer in an ‘S’ winding and away from
the viewer in an ‘F’ winding. At time, say t), shown
in Figure 22.1(a), the current flowing in the red phase
is a maximum positive value. At the same time, ft), the
currents flowing in the yellow and blue phases are both
0.5 times the maximum value and are negative.

The current distribution in the stator windings is
therefore as shown in Figure 22.1(b), in which current
flows away from the viewer (shown as @) in Rs since
it is positive, but towards the viewer (shown as ©) in
Ys and Bs, since these are negative. The resulting mag-
netic field is as shown, due to the ‘solenoid’ action and
application of the corkscrew rule.

A short time later at time f2, the current flowing in the
red phase has fallen to about 0.87 times its maximum
value and is positive, the current in the yellow phase
is zero and the current in the blue phase is about 0.87
times its maximum value and is negative. Hence the
currents and resultant magnetic field are as shown in
Figure 22.1(c). At time f3, the currents in the red and
yellow phases are 0.5 of their maximum values and the
current in the blue phase is a maximum negative value.
The currents and resultant magnetic field are as shown
in Figure 22.1(d).

Similar diagrams to Figure 22.1(b), (c) and (d) can
be produced for all time values and these would show
that the magnetic field travels through one revolution
for each cycle of the supply voltage applied to the stator
windings. By considering the flux values rather than
the current values, it is shown below that the rotating
magnetic field has a constant value of flux. The three
coils shown in Figure 22.2(a) are connected in star to
a three-phase supply. Let the positive directions of the
fluxes produced by currents flowing in the coils, be ¢4,
dp and gc, respectively. The directions of 64, dg and
¢c do not alter, but their magnitudes are proportional to
the currents flowing in the coils at any particular time.
At time t,, shown in Figure 22.2(b), the currents flowing
in the coils are:

ig, a maximum positive value, i.e. the flux is
towards point P;

ia and ic, half the maximum value and negative,
i.e. the flux is away from point P.

These currents give rise to the magnetic fluxes 64, dp
and éc, whose magnitudes and directions are as shown

in Figure 22.2(c). The resultant flux is the phasor sum of
Pa, bp and ¢c, shown as ® in Figure 22.2(c). At time
ta, the currents flowing are:
ip, 0.866 x maximum positive value, ic, zero, and
i, 0.866 x maximum negative value.

The magnetic fluxes and the resultant magnetic flux are
as shown in Figure 22.2(d).

At time £3, ig is 0.5 x maximum value and is positive
iq is a maximum negative value, and
ic is 0.5 x maximum value and is positive.

22.4 Construction of a three-phase

induction motor

The stator of a three-phase induction motor is the sta-
tionary part corresponding to the yoke of a d.c. machine.
It is wound to give a two-pole, four-pole, six-pole,......
rotating magnetic field, depending on the rotor speed
required. The rotor, corresponding to the armature of
a d.c. machine, is built up of laminated iron, to reduce
eddy currents.

In the type most widely used, known as a squirrel-
cage rotor, copper or aluminium bars are placed in slots
cut in the laminated iron, the ends of the bars being
welded or brazed into a heavy conducting ring (see
Figure 22.4(a)). A cross-sectional view of a three-phase
induction motor is shown in Figure 22.4(b).

The conductors are placed in slots in the laminated
iron rotor core. If the slots are skewed, better starting

Figure 22.4

and quieter running is achieved. This type of rotor has
no external connections, which means that slip-rings
and brushes are not needed. The squirrel-cage motor is
cheap, reliable and efficient.

Another type of rotor is the wound rotor. With this
type there are phase windings in slots, similar to those
in the stator. The windings may be connected in star
or delta and the connections made to three slip-rings.
The slip-rings are used to add external resistance to
the rotor circuit, particularly for starting (see Section
22.13), but for normal running the slip-rings are short
circuited.

The principle of operation is the same for both the
squirrel-cage and the wound rotor machines.

22.5 Principle of operation of a

three-phase induction motor

When a three-phase supply is connected to the stator
windings, a rotating magnetic field is produced. As the
magnetic flux cuts a bar on the rotor, an e.m.f. is induced
in it and since it is joined, via the end conducting rings,
to another bar one pole pitch away, a current flows in
the bars. The magnetic field associated with this current
flowing in the bars interacts with the rotating magnetic
field and a force is produced, tending to turn the rotor
in the same direction as the rotating magnetic field,
(see Figure 22.5). Similar forces are applied to all the
conductors on the rotor, so that a torque is produced,
causing the rotor to rotate.

Three-phase induction motors 329

Rotating magnetic
tield

Figure 22.5

The force exerted by the rotor bars causes the rotor to
turn in the direction of the rotating magnetic field. As
the rotor speed increases, the rate at which the rotating
magnetic field cuts the rotor bars is less and the fre-
quency of the induced e.m-f.s in the rotor bars is less. If
the rotor runs at the same speed as the rotating magnetic
field, no e.m.f.s are induced in the rotor, hence there is
no force on them and no torque on the rotor. Thus the
rotor slows down. For this reason the rotor can never
run at synchronous speed.

When there is no load on the rotor, the resistive forces
due to windage and bearing friction are small and the
rotor runs very nearly at synchronous speed. As the rotor
is loaded, the speed falls and this causes an increase in
the frequency of the induced e.m.f.s in the rotor bars
and hence the rotor current, force and torque increase.
The difference between the rotor speed, ;, and the
synchronous speed, ns, is called the slip speed, i.e.

slip speed =n, —1n, rev/s

The ratio (ns; —n,;)/ns is called the fractional slip or
just the slip, s, and is usually expressed as a percentage.
Thus

. Ns—Ny

Typical values of slip between no load and full load are
about 4 to 5% for small motors and 1.5 to 2% for large
motors.

E2= (S)e (1)

where E£ is the supply voltage per phase to the stator.

When an induction motor is running, the induced
e.m.f. in the rotor is less since the relative movement
between conductors and the rotating field is less. The

it must be proportional to the slip, s.

Problem 13. For the induction motor of Problems
10 to 12, determine the resistance of the rotor
winding required for maximum starting torque.

From equation (4), rotor reactance X;= sX2

At the moment of starting, slip, s = 1

Maximum torque occurs when rotor reactance
equals rotor resistance; hence for maximum torque,
Ry = X; = 8X2 = X12 =3.5Q

Thus if the induction motor was a wound rotor type with
slip-rings then an external star-connected resistance of
(3.5 — 0.35) Q = 3.15 Q per phase could be added to the

rotor resistance to give maximum torque at starting (see
Section 22.13).

Now try the following Practice Exercise

Practice Exercise 92 The torque equation
(Answers on page 750)

1. A 400V, three-phase, 50Hz, two-pole, star-
connected induction motor runs at 48.5 rev/s
on full load. The rotor resistance and reactance
per phase are 0.4Q and 4.0Q, respectively,
and the effective rotor—stator turns ratio is
0.8:1. Calculate (a) the synchronous speed, (b)
the slip, (c) the full load torque, (d) the power
output if mechanical losses amount to 500 W,
(e) the maximum torque, (f) the speed at which
maximum torque occurs, and (g) the starting
torque.

2. For the induction motor in Problem 1, calcu-
late at full load (a) the rotor current, (b) the
rotor copper loss and (c) the starting current.

3. If the stator losses for the induction motor in
Problem 1 are 525 W, calculate at full load
(a) the power input, (b) the efficiency of the
motor and (c) the current taken from the supply
if the motor runs at a power factor of 0.84

4. For the induction motor in Problem 1, deter-
mine the resistance of the rotor winding
required for maximum starting torque.

22.12 Induction motor torque-speed

characteristics

From Problem 10, parts (c) and (g), itis seen that the nor-
mal starting torque may be less than the full load torque.
Also, from Problem 10, parts (e) and (f), itis seen that the
speed at which maximum torque occurs is determined
by the value of the rotor resistance. At synchronous
speed, slip s = 0 and torque is zero. From these obser-
vations, the torque-speed and torque-slip characteristics
of an induction motor are as shown in Figure 22.9.

The rotor resistance of an induction motor is usu-
ally small compared with its reactance (for example,
Ro = 0.35 Q and X2 = 3.5 Qin the above problems), so
that maximum torque occurs at a high speed, typically
about 80% of synchronous speed.

Curve P in Figure 22.9 is a typical characteristic for
an induction motor. The curve P cuts the full load torque
line at point X, showing that at full load the slip is about
4-5%. The normal operating conditions are between
0 and X, thus it can be seen that for normal operation the
speed variation with load is quite small — the induction
motor is an almost constant-speed machine. Redraw-
ing the speed—torque characteristic between 0 and X
gives the characteristic shown in Figure 22.10, which is
similar to a d.c. shunt motor as shown in Chapter 21.

Figure 22.10

If maximum torque is required at starting then a high
resistance rotor is necessary, which gives characteristic
Qin Figure 22.9. However, as can be seen, the motor has
a full load slip of over 30%, which results in a drop in
efficiency. Also, such a motor has a large speed variation
with variations of load. Curves R and S of Figure 22.9 are
characteristics for values of rotor resistances between
those of P and Q. Better starting torque than for curve
P is obtained, but with lower efficiency and with speed
variations under operating conditions.

A squirrel-cage induction motor would normally
follow characteristic P. This type of machine is highly

Siip 100%
Speed o

efficient and about constant-speed under normal run-
ning conditions. However, it has a poor starting torque
and must be started off-load or very lightly loaded (see
Section 22.13 below). Also, on starting, the current can
be four or five times the normal full load current, due
to the motor acting like a transformer with secondary
short-circuited. In Problem 11, for example, the current
at starting was nearly three times the full load current.

A wound-rotor induction motor would follow char-
acteristic P when the slip-rings are short-circuited,
which is the normal running condition. However, the
slip-rings allow for the addition of resistance to the
rotor circuit externally and, as a result, for starting, the
motor can have a characteristic similar to curve Q in
Figure 22.9 and the high starting current experienced
by the cage induction motor can be overcome.

In general, for three-phase induction motors, the
power factor is usually between about 0.8 and 0.9
lagging, and the full load efficiency is usually about
80-90%

From equation (12) it is seen that torque is propor-
tional to the square of the supply voltage. Any voltage
variations therefore would seriously affect the induction
motor performance.

Gi) Auto transformer starting

With this method, an auto transformer is used
to reduce the stator voltage, E,, and thus the
starting current (see equation (7)). However,
the starting torque is seriously reduced (see
equation (12)), so the voltage is reduced only
sufficiently to give the required reduction of the
starting current. A typical arrangement is shown
in Figure 22.11. A double-throw switch connects
the auto transformer in circuit for starting, and
when the motor is up to speed the switch is
moved to the run position, which connects the
supply directly to the motor.

(iii) Star-delta starting

With this method for starting, the connections
to the stator phase winding are star-connected,

Induction
molor

so that the voltage across each phase winding is
1/,/3 (i.e. 0.577) of the line voltage. For running,
the windings are switched to delta connection.
A typical arrangement is shown in Figure 22.12.
This method of starting is less expensive than by
auto transformer.

Wound rotor

When starting on load is necessary, a wound rotor induc-
tion motor must be used. This is because maximum
torque at starting can be obtained by adding external
resistance to the rotor circuit via slip-rings (see Prob-
lem 13). A face-plate type starter is used, and as the
resistance is gradually reduced, the machine character-
istics at each stage will be similar to Q, S, R and P of
Figure 22.13. At each resistance step, the motor opera-
tion will transfer from one characteristic to the next so
that the overall starting characteristic will be as shown
by the bold line in Figure 22.13. For very large induction
motors, very gradual and smooth starting is achieved by
a liquid-type resistance.

(i) are cheaper and more robust
(ii) have slightly higher efficiency and power factor

(iii) are explosion-proof, since the risk of sparking
is eliminated by the absence of slip-rings and

22.15 Advantages of wound rotor

induction motor

The advantages of the wound rotor motor compared with
the cage type are that they:

(i) have a much higher starting torque
Gi) have a much lower starting current

(iii) have a means of varying speed by use of external
rotor resistance.

22.16 Double cage induction motor

The advantages of squirrel-cage and wound rotor induc-
tion motors are combined in the double cage induction
motor. This type of induction motor is specially con-
structed with the rotor having two cages, one inside the
other. The outer cage has high-resistance conductors so
that maximum torque is achieved at or near starting.
The inner cage has normal low-resistance copper con-
ductors but high reactance since it is embedded deep
in the iron core. The torque—speed characteristic of the
inner cage is that of a normal induction motor, as shown
in Figure 22.14. At starting, the outer cage produces

the torque, but when running the inner cage produces
the torque. The combined characteristic of inner and
outer cages is shown in Figure 22.14. The double cage
induction motor is highly efficient when running.

motors

Three-phase induction motors are widely used in indus-
try and constitute almost all industrial drives where a
nearly constant speed is required, from small workshops
to the largest industrial enterprises.

Typical applications are with machine tools, pumps
and mill motors. The squirrel cage rotor type is the most
widely used of all a.c. motors.

Revision of complex numbers

Why it is important to understand: Complex numbers

Complex numbers are used in many scientific fields, including engineering, electromagnetism, quantum
physics and applied mathematics, such as chaos theory. Any physical motion which is periodic, such as
an oscillating beam, string, wire, pendulum, electronic signal or electromagnetic wave can be represented
by a complex number function. This can make calculations with the various components simpler than
with real numbers and sines and cosines. In control theory, systems are often transformed from the time
domain to the frequency domain using the Laplace transform. In fluid dynamics, complex functions are
used to describe potential flow in two dimensions. In electrical engineering, the Fourier transform is used
to analyse varying voltages and currents. Complex numbers are used in signal analysis and other fields
for a convenient description for periodically varying signals. This use is also extended into digital signal
processing and digital image processing, which utilize digital versions of Fourier analysis (and wavelet
analysis) to transmit, compress, restore and otherwise process digital audio signals, still images and video
signals. Knowledge of complex numbers is clearly absolutely essential for further studies in so many

engineering disciplines and is used extensively in many of the ensuing chapters.

23.1 Introduction

A complex number is of the form (a+ jb) where a is
a real number and jb is an imaginary number. Hence
(1+ j2) and (5 — j7) are examples of complex numbers.

By definition, j = /—1 and j?=-1

Complex numbers are widely used in the analysis of
series, parallel and series—parallel electrical networks
supplied by alternating voltages (see Chapters 24

to 26), in deriving balance equations with a.c.
bridges (see Chapter 27), in analysing a.c. cir-
cuits using Kirchhoff’s laws (Chapter 30), mesh
and nodal analysis (Chapter 31), the superposition
theorem (Chapter 32), with Thévenin’s and Nor-
ton’s theorems (Chapter 33) and with delta—star
and star—delta transforms (Chapter 34) and in many
other aspects of higher electrical engineering. The
advantage of the use of complex numbers is that
the manipulative processes become simply algebraic
processes.

Figure 23.1 The Argand diagram

A complex number can be represented pictorially
on an Argand* diagram. In Figure 23.1, the line 0A
represents the complex number (2+ /3), OB represents
(3—j), OC represents (—2+j2) and OD represents
(—4— 73)

A complex number of the form a+ jb is called a
Cartesian or rectangular complex number (Cartesian
being named after Descartes*). The significance of the
J Operator is shown in Figure 23.2. In Figure 23.2(a) the
number 4 (i.e. 4+ j0) is shown drawn as a phasor hori-
zontally to the right of the origin on the real axis. (Such
a phasor could represent, for example, an alternating
current, i =4sin wt amperes, when time f is zero.)

The number /4 (i.e. 0+ j4) is shown in Figure 23.2(b)
drawn vertically upwards from the origin on the imag-
inary axis. Hence multiplying the number 4 by the
operator j results in an anticlockwise phase-shift of 90°
without altering its magnitude.

Multiplying j4 by j gives j*4, ie. —4, and is
shown in Figure 23.2(c) as a phasor four units long
on the horizontal real axis to the left of the origin —
an anticlockwise phase-shift of 90° compared with the
position shown in Figure 23.2(b). Thus multiplying by
j° reverses the original direction of a phasor.

Multiplying j74 by j gives j°4, ie. —j4, and is
shown in Figure 23.2(d) as a phasor four units long on
the vertical, imaginary axis downward from the origin —
an anticlockwise phase-shift of 90° compared with the
position shown in Figure 23.2(c).

Multiplying j°4 by j gives j*4, ie. 4, which is the
original position of the phasor shown in Figure 23.2(a).
Summarizing, application of the operator j to any
number rotates it 90° anticlockwise on the Argand
diagram, multiplying a number by j? rotates it 180°

Revision of complexnumbers 347

anticlockwise, multiplying a number by j? rotates it
270° anticlockwise and multiplication by j* rotates it
360° anticlockwise, i.e. back to its original position. In
each case the phasor is unchanged in its magnitude.
By similar reasoning, if a phasor is operated on by —j
then a phase shift of —90° (i.e. clockwise direction)
occurs, again without change of magnitude.

In electrical circuits, 90° phase shifts occur between
voltage and current with pure capacitors and inductors;
this is the key to why j notation is used so much in
the analysis of electrical networks. This is explained in
Chapter 24.

23.2 Operations involving Cartesian

complex numbers

(a) Addition and subtraction

(a+ jb) + (c+jd) = (at+c)+ jb+d)
and = (a+ jb) — (c+ jd) = (a—c)+ j(b—-d)
Thus, (3+ j2)+(2— j4) = 3+ j2+2- j4=5-j2
and (3+ j2)—(2— j4) = 3+ j2—-2+4 j4=1 +4 j6

(b) Multiplication

(a+ jb)(ct+ jd) =ac + a(jd) + Gdc+ (ib) id)
=ac+ jad + jbc+ j7bd

But j?=—1, thus
(a+ jb)(c+ jd) = (ac — bd) + j(ad+bc)
For example,

(3+ j2)(2— j4) =6 — j12+ j4— j78
= (6 — (—1)8) + j(—12 +4)
= 14+4 j(-8)=14-j8

(c) Complex conjugate

The complex conjugate of (a+jb) is (a—jb). For
example, the conjugate of (3 — j2) is (3+ j2)

The product of a complex number and its complex
conjugate is always a real number, and this is an impor-
tant property used when dividing complex numbers.

Thus
(a + jb)(a — jb) = a? — jab + jab — jb?
=a* —(—b’)

=a +b (i.e. a real number)

(1+ j2)— j2)= 42? =5
and 3-j4B+j4=7 +4 =25

For example,

(d) Division

The expression of one complex number divided by
another, in the form a +jb, is accomplished by multiply-
ing the numerator and denominator by the complex con-
jugate of the denominator. This has the effect of making
the denominator a real number. Hence, for example,

2+ j4 _ 2+j4 34 j4 _ 6+ j84jl2+ j°16
3-j4 3-j4 34+ j4 37 4+ 4?
6+ j8+ j12— 16
~ 25
—10+ 20
~ 95

The elimination of the imaginary part of the denomin-
ator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator
by the conjugate of the denominator is often termed
‘rationalizing’.

23.3 Complex equations

If two complex numbers are equal, then their real parts
are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. Hence, if
a+jb=c+ jd thena=c andb=d. This is auseful prop-
erty, since equations having two unknown quantities can
be solved from one equation. Complex equations are
used when deriving balance equations with a.c. bridges
(see Chapter 27).

Problem 3. Solve the following complex
equations:

(a) 3(a+jb)=9—-j2
(b) (2+j)(-24+j)=x+iy
(c) (a—j2b)+(b— j3a)=5+ j2

(a) 3(a+jb)=9— j2. Thus 3a+ j3b=9— j2
Equating real parts gives: 3a =9, i.e.a=3

Equating imaginary parts gives:
3b=—2, i.e. b= —2/3

(b) (24+ j)(-2+j)=x+jy
Thus —4+4 j2—j2+j7=x+jy

—54+ j0O=x+jy
Equating real and imaginary parts gives: x = —5,
y=0
(c) (a—j2b)+(b— j3a)=5+ j2
Thus (a+b)+ j(—2b —3a)=5+ j2

Hence a+b=5 (

=
wm

and —2b—3a=2 (2)

We have two simultaneous equations to solve.
Multiplying equation (1) by (2) gives:

2a +2b = 10 (3)

Adding equations (2) and (3) gives —a=12, i.e.
a=-—12

From equation (1), b=17

Problem 4. An equation derived from an a.c.
bridge network is given by

Ry R3 = (R2 + joLlz2) | a joc |

R,, R3, Ra and C4 are known values. Determine
expressions for R2 and L2 in terms of the known
components.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by (1/R4+ja@Cq4)
gives
(R1 R3)(/Rq + joCg) = Ro + jol2
ie. Ry R3/R4+ jR,R3@C4 = Ro+ joLl2
Equating the real parts gives: R72 = R1R3/R4
Equating the imaginary parts gives:

@L7 = R, R3@C4, from which, Lz = R1R3C4

This latter form is usually abbreviated to Z=rZ6, and
is called the polar form of a complex number.

r is called the modulus (or magnitude of Z) and
is written as mod Z or |Z]. r is determined from
Pythagoras’ theorem on triangle OAZ, i.e.

Z| =r = /(x* +’)

The modulus is represented on the Argand diagram by
the distance OZ. @ is called the argument (or amplitude)
of Z and is written as arg Z. 0 is also deduced from
triangle OAZ: arg Z = 0 = tan‘ y/x.

For example, the Cartesian complex number (3 + j4)
is equal to r 6 in polar form, where r= / (32 +47) =5

4
and @=tan—! 3 = 53.13°

Hence (3+/4) =5253.13°

Similarly, (—3+j4) is shown in Figure 23.3(b),
4
where r =,/(32 +42) =5, 6’ = tan“! 5 =53.13°

and = @=180° —53.13°=126.87°

Hence (—3+j4)=52126.87°

23.5 Multiplication and division using

Thus 3225° x 2732° =6257°,
4Z11° x 5Z—18° =202-7°,
22(a/3) x 7Z(a6) =142Z(2/2), and so on.

Conversion from Cartesian or rectangular form to

R— P and P > R conversion facility which is available
on most calculators with scientific notation. This allows,
of course, a saving of time.

Using trigonometrical ratios,
x = 5cos48° = 3.346 and y = 5sin48° = 3.716
Hence 5Z—132° = —3.346 —j3.716
Alternatively,
5Z—132° = 5(cos —132° + j sin —132°)
= 5cos(—132°) + j5sin(—132°)
= —3.346 — 73.716, as above

With this latter method the real and imaginary parts are
obtained directly, using a calculator.

23.6 De Moivre’s theorem - powers

and roots of complex numbers

De Moivre’s theorem,” states:
[rZ0}" =r" Znd

This result is true for all positive, negative or fractional
values of n. De Moivre’s theorem is thus useful in
determining powers and roots of complex numbers. For
example,

[2215°]® = 2°(6 x 15°) = 64290° = 0+j64

A square root of a complex number is determined as
follows:

Vir 26) =[r Zo]? =r! 240

However, it is important to realize that a real number has
two square roots, equal in size but opposite in sign. On
an Argand diagram the roots are 180° apart (see worked
Problem 8 following).

Problem 7. Determine (—2+ j3)> in polar and in
Cartesian form.

Z=-—2-+ j3 is situated in the second quadrant of the

Argand diagram.

Thus r=/[(2)*+(3)?]=/13 and a =tan7!3/2

Hence the argument 6 = 180° —56.31° = 123.69°

In Cartesian form,

609.3Z—101.55° = 609.3 cos (—101.55°)
+ j609.3sin(—101.55°)
= —122 —j597

Problem 8. Determine the two square roots of the
complex number (12+ 75) in Cartesian and polar
form, correct to three significant figures. Show the
roots on an Argand diagram.

In polar form 12+ j5=,/(127+57)Ztan7!(5/12),
since 12+ 75 is in the first quadrant of the Argand
diagram, ie. 12+ j5=13222.62°

Since we are finding the square roots of 13222.62°
there will be two solutions. To obtain the second
solution it is helpful to express 13222.62° also as
132 (360° + 22.62°), i.e. 137382.62° (we have merely
rotated one revolution to obtain this result). The reason
for doing this is that when we divide the angles by 2 we
still obtain angles less than 360°, as shown below.

Hence ./(12 + j5) = V[13222.62°] or /[132382.62°]
=[13222.62°]'/* or [132382.62°]!/2

Application of complex
numbers to series a.c. circuits

Why it is important to understand: Application of complex numbers to series a.c. circuits

Complex numbers are useful for a.c. circuit analysis because they provide a convenient method of symbol-
ically denoting phase shift between a.c. quantities like voltage and current. When analysing alternating
current circuits, it is found that quantities of voltage, current and even resistance (called impedance in
a.c. circuits) are not the familiar one-dimensional quantities used in d.c. circuits. Rather, these quantities,
because they’re dynamic, i.e. they are alternating in direction and amplitude, possess other dimensions
that must be taken into account. Frequency and phase shift are two of these dimensions. Even with rel-
atively simple a.c. circuits, dealing with a single frequency, there is still phase shift to contend with in
addition to the amplitude. A complex number is a single mathematical quantity able to express these two
dimensions of amplitude and phase shift at once. Oscillating currents and voltages are complex values
that have a real part we can measure and an imaginary part which we cannot. At first it seems pointless to
create something we can’t see or measure, but it is actually useful in a number of ways. Firstly, it helps us
understand the behaviour of circuits which contain reactance, produced by capacitors or inductors, when
we apply a.c. signals and, secondly, it gives us a new way to think about oscillations. This is useful when
we want to apply concepts like the conservation of energy to understanding the behaviour of systems
which range from simple mechanical pendulums to a quartz-crystal oscillator. Knowledge of complex
numbers makes the analysis of a.c. series circuits straightforward.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

The circuit phase angle, i.e. the angle between the cur-
rent and the applied voltage, is shown as angle ¢ in
the phasor diagram. In any series circuit the current is
common to all components and is thus taken as the ref-
erence phasor in Figure 24.4(b). The phasor diagram
may be superimposed on the Argand diagram as shown
in Figure 24.4(c), where it may be seen that in complex

Thus, for example, an impedance expressed as

inductive reactance is 4Q.

In polar form, Z=|Z| Z@ where, from the impedance
triangle, the modulus of impedance |Z| = ./(R2 +. X *)
and the circuit phase angle ¢ = tan—!(X /R) lagging.

(e) R-C series circuit

In an a.c. circuit containing resistance R and capaci-
tance C in series (see Figure 24.6(a)), the applied voltage
V is the phasor sum of Vr and Vc, as shown in the
phasor diagram of Figure 24.6(b). The current J leads
the applied voltage V by an angle lying between 0°
and 90° — the actual value depending on the values of
Vr and Vc, which depend on the values of R and C.
The circuit phase angle is shown as angle ¢ in the phasor
diagram. The phasor diagram may be superimposed on
the Argand diagram as shown in Figure 24.6(c), where
it may be seen that in complex form the supply voltage
V is given by:

V=Vr-jVc

capacitive reactance X¢ is 14Q

In polar form, Z =|Z| Z@ where, from the impedance

(f) R-L-C series circuit

In an a.c. circuit containing resistance R, inductance L
and capacitance C in series (see Figure 24.8(a)), the
applied voltage V is the phasor sum of Vr, Vz and Vc,
as shown in the phasor diagram of Figure 24.8(b) (where
the condition Vz > Vc is shown). The phasor diagram
may be superimposed on the Argand diagram as shown
in Figure 24.8(c), where it may be seen that in complex
form the supply voltage V is given by:

V=Vrt+ji(Vi — Vc)

From the voltage triangle the impedance triangle is
derived and superimposing this on the Argand diagram
gives, in complex form,

impedance Z = R+j(X, —Xc) or Z=|Z| Z¢

(g) General series circuit

In an a.c. circuit containing several impedances con-
nected in series, say, Z1, Z2, Z3,..., Zn, then the total
equivalent impedance Z7 is given by

Zr =Z,+2Z24+Z34+-+++Zn

Problem 1. Determine the values of the
resistance and the series-connected inductance or
capacitance for each of the following impedances:
(a) 12+ j5) Q, (b) —j40Q, (c) 30260° Q,

(d) 2.20 x 10°7—30° Q. Assume for each a
frequency of 50 Hz.

(a) From Section 24.2(d), for an R—L series circuit,
impedance Z=R+jXz,
Thus Z=(12+j5)Q represents a resistance of
12Q and an inductive reactance of 5Q in

i.e. the inductance is 15.9mH

Thus an impedance (12 + j5)Q& represents a
resistance of 12 Q in series with an inductance
of 15.9mH

(b) From Section 24.2(c), for a purely capacitive
circuit, impedance Z=—jXc
Thus Z = — j40Q represents zero resistance and a
capacitive reactance of 40Q.

Thus an impedance — j40Q represents a pure
capacitor of capacitance 79.6 WF

(c) 30260° =30(cos60° + j sin60°) = 15+ 725.98

Thus Z =30260° Q= (15 + j25.98) Q represents
a resistance of 15 Q and an inductive reactance of
25.98 Q in series (from Section 24.2(d)).

Since X, =2afL

inductance L = —— =

Thus an impedance 30260°Q represents a

of 82.7mH

(d) 2.20 x 10°2—30°
=2.20 x 10°[cos(—30°) + j sin(—30°)]

Thus Z =2.20 x 10°7—30° Q

Application of complex

networks

Why it is important to understand: Application of complex numbers to parallel a.c. circuits

As with series circuits, parallel networks may be analysed by using phasor diagrams. However, with
parallel networks containing more than two branches, this can become very complicated. It is with parallel
a.c. network analysis in particular that the full benefit of using complex numbers may be appreciated.
Parallel a.c. circuits are like parallel d.c. circuits, except that phasors need to be used throughout the
analysis. Also, the same rules that are needed in analysing parallel d.c. circuits, such as Kirchhoff’s
current law and the current division rule, are also needed for parallel a.c. networks. Before analysing
such networks, admittance, conductance and susceptance are defined. Knowledge of complex numbers
makes the analysis of a.c. parallel networks straightforward.

25.1 Introduction

As with series circuits, parallel networks may be
analysed by using phasor diagrams. However, with
parallel networks containing more than two branches
this can become very complicated. It is with parallel
a.c. network analysis in particular that the full benefit of

using complex numbers may be appreciated. The theory
for parallel a.c. networks introduced in Chapter 16 is
relevant; more advanced networks will be analysed in
this chapter using j notation. Before analysing such
networks admittance, conductance and susceptance are
defined.

25.2 Admittance, conductance
and susceptance

Admittance is defined as the current J flowing in an
a.c. circuit divided by the supply voltage V (i.e. it is the
reciprocal of impedance Z). The symbol for admittance
is Y. Thus

rT 1
Y=-—=>-— e
Vz (e)
The unit of admittance is the siemen,* S.
An impedance may be resolved into a real part R
and an imaginary part X, giving Z=R=+ jX. Similarly,
an admittance may be resolved into two parts — the real
part being called the conductance G, and the imaginary
part being called the susceptance B — and expressed in
complex form. Thus admittance
Y=G+jB

The conclusions that may be drawn from Sections
(d) to (g) above are:

(i) that a series circuit is more easily represented
by an impedance,

(ii) that a parallel circuit is often more eas-
ily represented by an admittance especially
when more than two parallel impedances are
involved.

Problem 1. Determine the admittance,
conductance and susceptance of the following
impedances: (a) — j5 Q, (b) (25 + j40) Q,

(c) (3 — j2)Q, (d) 50240° Q

(a) Ifimpedance Z = —j5Q, then

Since there is no real part, conductance, G=0,

the impedance of the following admittances:
(a) 0.004230°S, (b) (0.001 — j0.002)S,
(c) (0.05 + j 0.08)S.

Draw the phasor diagram for each of the circuits.

Power In a.c. circuits

Why it is important to understand: Power in a.c. circuits

Power in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the circuit. In alternating
current circuits, energy storage elements such as inductance and capacitance may result in periodic
reversals of the direction of energy flow. The portion of power averaged over a complete cycle of the
a.c. waveform results in net transfer of energy in one direction, and is known as real power. The portion
of power due to stored energy, which returns to the source in each cycle, is known as reactive power.
Renewable energy sources are used mainly to generate a.c. electrical power, which is injected into power
networks consisting of a large number of transmission lines, conventional generators and consumers. Such
power networks, especially in developed countries, are of considerable complexity. To determine the way
these injected powers flow from generators to consumers requires complex calculations based on network
analysis. This chapter introduces the basic concepts of active, reactive and apparent power. These are
the basic tools needed to understand and calculate flows of energy from generators to consumers. In all
a.c. power systems, excluding very low capacity ones, power is generated and transported in three-phase
form. Power factor can be an important aspect to consider in an a.c. circuit, because any power factor
less than 1 means that the circuit’s wiring has to carry more current than would be necessary with zero
reactance in the circuit to deliver the same amount of true power to the resistive load. Calculation of
power in a.c. circuits, together with the advantages of power factor improvement, are considered in this
chapter.

circuits

(a) Purely resistive a.c. circuits

Let a voltage v=V,,sin@t be applied to a circuit
comprising resistance only. The resulting current is
i=I,sinwt, and the corresponding instantaneous
power, p, is given by:

Pp =odi = (Vn Sin@t) (Um sinat)

Le. P=Vmnlmn sin’ ot

From trigonometrical double angle formulae,
cos2A = 1 —2sin?A, from which,

sin? A = (1 —cos2A)
Thus sin?et = (1 — cos2ot)
Then power p = VinJIm [5(1 — cos 2) |
ie. p= 5 VinIm(1 — cos 21)

The waveforms of v, i and p are shown in Figure 26.1.
The waveform of power repeats itself after z/@ seconds
and hence the power has a frequency twice that of volt-
age and current. The power is always positive, having
a maximum value of V,, [j,. The average or mean value
of the power is 5 Vin In

Summarizing, the average power P in a purely
resistive a.c. circuit is given by

y2
P=VI=PR= watts

where V and / are r.m.s. values.

(b) Purely inductive a.c. circuits

Let a voltage v = V,, sinwt be applied to a circuit con-
taining pure inductance (theoretical case). The result-
ing current is i = J), sin(@t — (z/2)) since current lags
voltage by 90° in a purely inductive circuit, and the
corresponding instantaneous power, p, is given by:

Pp =vdi = (Vn sin@t) Ip sin(@t — (2/2))

ie. p= Vm sinet sin(@t — (2/2))

However, sin(wt — (z/2)) =—cosat
Thus p = —ViJm sinet cos ot
1
Rearranging gives: p=— 5 VinnIm (2sinotcosot).

However, from the double angle formulae,
2 sin wt cos wt = sin 2at

1
Thus power, p=— 3 VinIm Sin 2ot

The waveforms of v, i and p are shown in Figure 26.2.
The frequency of power is twice that of voltage and
current. For the power curve shown in Figure 26.2, the
area above the horizontal axis is equal to the area below,
thus over a complete cycle the average power P is zero.

i Seconds)

Figure 26.2 Power in a purely inductive a.c. circuit

Power ina.c. circuits 379

It is noted that when ov and i are both positive, power p
is positive and energy is delivered from the source to the
inductance; when v andi have opposite signs, power p
is negative and energy is returned from the inductance
to the source.

In general, when the current through an inductance is
increasing, energy is transferred from the circuit to the
magnetic field, but this energy is returned when the
current is decreasing.

Summarizing, the average power P in a purely
inductive a.c. circuit is zero.

(c) Purely capacitive a.c. circuits

Let a voltage v=V,, sin@wt be applied to a circuit
containing pure capacitance. The resulting current is
i=IJ, sin(@t + (z/2)), since current leads voltage by
90° in a purely capacitive circuit, and the corresponding
instantaneous power, p, is given by:

p=vi=(V» sin@t) Im sin(@t + (7/2))
Le. p=VnJm sinat sin(wt + (7/2))
However, sin(wt + (z/2)) = cosat
Thus P=V,, [jn sin@t cos at

Rearranging gives p = 5 VinIm(2 sin wt cos at)

Thus power, p= zVm Tn sin 2ot

The waveforms of v, i and p are shown in Figure 26.3.
Over a complete cycle the average power P is zero.

field, but this energy is returned when the voltage is
decreasing.

Summarizing, the average power P in a purely
capacitive a.c. circuit is zero.

(d) R-L or R-C a.c. circuits

Let a voltage v=V,,sin@wt be applied to a cir-
cuit containing resistance and inductance or resis-
tance and capacitance. Let the resulting current be
i=I, sin(wt+¢), where phase angle ¢ will be posi-
tive for an R-C circuit and negative for an R—L circuit.
The corresponding instantaneous power, p, is given by:

p=vi=(Vm sinwt) (Um sin(@t + ¢))
Le. D=VmlImsinot sin(wt +)

Products of sine functions may be changed into differ-
ences of cosine functions by using:

sin A sin B= —4[cos(A + B)—cos(A—B)]
Substituting wt = A and (wt +¢)=B gives:
power, D=Vy Im {- 5 [cos(@t +a@t+¢)

— cos(or— (or +4))]|
i.e. p= 5 Vin In[cos(—¢) —cos(2at + )]
However, cos(—¢) = cos@
Thus p= $V inl mlcos @ — cos(2@t +¢)]
The instantaneous power p thus consists of

(i) a sinusoidal term, —5Vin In cos(2at +), which
has a mean value over a cycle of zero, and

(ii) aconstant term, 5 Vin In cos ¢ (since ¢ is constant
for a particular circuit).

Thus the average value of power, P = 5 Vn In cos &
Since Vin =./2 V and In =./21

average power, P = 5(/2 V)(./21) cos d

i.e. P=VI cos ¢ watts

The waveforms of v, i and p are shown in Figure 26.4
for an R—L circuit. The waveform of power is seen to
pulsate at twice the supply frequency. The areas of the
power curve (shown shaded) above the horizontal time
axis represent power supplied to the load; the small
areas below the axis represent power being returned to
the supply from the inductance as the magnetic field
collapses.

A similar shape of power curve is obtained for an
R-C circuit, the small areas below the horizontal axis
representing power being returned to the supply from
the charged capacitor. The difference between the areas
above and below the horizontal axis represents the heat
loss due to the circuit resistance. Since power is dissi-
pated only in a pure resistance, the alternative equations
for power, P= I R, may be used, where Jp is the r.m.s.
current flowing through the resistance.

Summarizing, the average power P in a circuit con-
taining resistance and inductance and/or capaci-
tance, whether in series or in parallel, is given by
P=VIcos@ or P=i,, R (V, I and Ip being r.m.s.
values).

26.3 Power triangle and power factor

A phasor diagram in which the current J lags the applied
voltage V by angle ¢ (i.e. an inductive circuit) is shown
in Figure 26.5(a). The horizontal component of V is
V cos ¢@, and the vertical component of V is V sin ¢. If
each of the voltage phasors of triangle Oab is multiplied
by 7, Figure 26.5(b) is produced and is known as the
‘power triangle’. Each side of the triangle represents
a particular type of power:

True or active power P = VI cos@¢ watts (W)
Apparent power S = VI voltamperes (VA)
Reactive power Q = VI sing vars (var)
The power triangle is not a phasor diagram since quan-

tities P, Q and S are mean values and not r.m.s. values
of sinusoidally varying quantities.

(b) P-YVisin ?

Figure 26.5 (a) Phasor diagram, (b) power triangle for induc-
tive circuit

Superimposing the power triangle on an Argand dia-
gram produces a relationship between P, S and Q in
complex form, i.e.

S=P+j0

Apparent power, S, is an important quantity since
a.c. apparatus, such as generators, transformers and
cables, is usually rated in voltamperes rather than in
watts. The allowable output of such apparatus is usually
limited not by mechanical stress but by temperature rise,
and hence by the losses in the device. The losses are
determined by the voltage and current and are almost
independent of the power factor. Thus the amount of
electrical equipment installed to supply a certain load
is essentially determined by the voltamperes of the load
rather than by the power alone.

The rating of a machine is defined as the maximum
apparent power that it is designed to carry continuously
without overheating.

The reactive power, Q, contributes nothing to the net
energy transfer and yet it causes just as much loading
of the equipment as if it did so. Reactive power is a
term much used in power generation, distribution and
utilization of electrical energy.

Inductive reactive power, by convention, is defined as
positive reactive power; capacitive reactive power, by
convention, is defined as negative reactive power. The
above relationships derived from the phasor diagram
of an inductive circuit may be shown to be true for a
capacitive circuit, the power triangle being as shown in
Figure 26.6.

26.4 Use of complex numbers

for determination of power

Let a circuit be supplied by an alternating voltage V Za,
where
VZa = V(cosa+ jsina) = Vcosa+jVsina

=a+ jb (1)

Let the current flowing in the circuit be 776, where

IZB =I (cosB+jsinf) = Icosf + j/sin B

=ct jd (2)
From Sections 26.2 and 26.3, power P= VIcos ¢, where
¢ is the angle between the voltage V and current /. If

the voltage is V Za° and the current is 17°, then the
angle between voltage and current is (a — £)°

Thus power, P = VIcos(a — £)

From compound angle formulae,

cos(a — #)=cosa cosf+ sina sin Bp

Hence power, P=VI{[cos a cos f6+sina sin fp]

Rearranging gives

P=(V cosa) cos £)+(V sin a)(/ sin f), ie.

P =(a)(c)+(b)(d) from equations (1) and (2)

Summarizing, if V = (a + jb) and I = (c + jd), then
power, P =ac+bd (3)

Thus power may be calculated from the sum of the prod-
ucts of the real components and imaginary components
of voltage and current.

Reactive power, Q=VI sin(a — f)

From compound angle formulae,

sin(a — 8) =sin a cos f —cos a sin fp

Thus Q=V/I[sin a cos f —cos a sin f]

Rearranging gives

Q=(V sina)(/ cos B)—(V cos a)U/ sin £), ie.
Q=(b)(c) —(a)(d) from equations (1) and (2)
Summarizing, if V=(a + jb) and I= (c+/d), then

reactive power, OQ =bc—ad (4)

Expressions (3) and (4) provide an alternative method
of determining true power P and reactive power Q
when the voltage and current are complex quantities.
From Section 26.3, apparent power S= P+jQ. How-
ever, merely multiplying V by J in complex form will
not give this result, i.e. (from above)

S=VI= (a+ jb)(c+ jd) = (ac — bd) + j(bc+ad)

Here the real part is not the expression for power as
given in equation (3) and the imaginary part is not the
expression of reactive power given in equation (4).

The correct expression may be derived by multiply-
ing the voltage V by the conjugate of the current, i.e.
(c — jd), denoted by /*. Thus

apparent power S = VI* = (a +jb)(c —jd)
=(ac+bd)+ j(bc—ad)

i.e. S=P-+/Q from equations (3) and (4)

Thus the active and reactive powers may be deter-
mined if, and only if, the voltage V is multiplied by
the conjugate of current J. As stated in Section 26.3, a

There are three methods of calculating power.

Method 1. Active power, P=VI cos ¢, where ¢

is the angle between voltage V and cur-
rent 7. Hence

P =(52)(4) cos[30° — (—37.38°)]
=(52)(4) cos 67.38° =80 W
Active power, P = I; R=(4)?(5)=80W

Method 2.

Method 3. Since V = (45.03 + 26.0) V and

1 =(3.18— 2.43) A, then active
power,

P=(45.03) (3.18) + (26.0) (—2.43)
from equation (3)

ie. P=143.2—63.2=80W

Problem 2. A current of (15+ 78) A flows in a
circuit whose supply voltage is (120+ j200) V.
Determine (a) the active power and (b) the reactive
power.

(a) Method 1. Active power P =(120)(15)+(200)(8),
from equation (3), i.e.

P =1800+ 1600 =3400 W or 3.4kW

Method 2. Current J =(15+ j8)A=17228.07°A

Hence power, P=VIcos¢

(b) Method 1. Reactive power,
Q=(200)(15) —(120)(8)

Method 2. Reactive power,

and the phase angle of the voltage =+7/9 rad or
20° leading. Hence as a phasor the voltage V is
written as 100220° V

Power factor = 0.866 = cos ¢, from which

d= cos! 0.866 =30°

Hence the angle between voltage and current
is 30°

26.5 Power factor improvement

For a particular power supplied, a high power factor
reduces the current flowing in a supply system, which
consequently lowers losses (i.e. 7 R losses) and hence
results in cheaper running costs (as stated in Section
16.7, page 233). Supply authorities use tariffs which
encourage consumers to operate at a reasonably high
power factor. One method of improving the power factor
of an inductive load is to connect a bank of capacitors
in parallel with the load. Capacitors are rated in reactive
voltamperes and the effect of the capacitors is to reduce
the reactive power of the system without changing the
active power. Most residential and industrial loads on a
power system are inductive, i.e. they operate at a lagging
power factor.

A simplified circuit diagram is shown in Figure
26.15(a) where a capacitor C is connected across an
inductive load. Before the capacitor is connected the
circuit current is J7r and is shown lagging voltage V
by angle ¢; in the phasor diagram of Figure 26.15(b).
When the capacitor C is connected it takes a current Ic
which is shown in the phasor diagram leading voltage
V by 90°. The supply current J in Figure 26.15(a) is
now the phasor sum of currents [yz and Jc as shown in
Figure 26.15(b). The circuit phase angle, i.e. the angle

Figure 26.15 (a) Circuit diagram (b) phasor diagram

between V and /, has been reduced from ¢; to ¢2 and
the power factor has been improved from cos ¢; to
cos ¢2

Figure 26.16(a) shows the power triangle for an
inductive circuit with a lagging power factor of cos ¢}.
In Figure 26.16(b), the angle ¢; has been reduced to
$2, i.e. the power factor has been improved from cos ¢;
to cos ¢2 by introducing leading reactive voltamperes
(shown as length ab) which is achieved by connect-
ing capacitance in parallel with the inductive load. The
power factor has been improved by reducing the reac-
tive voltamperes; the active power P has remained
unaffected.

Power factor correction results in the apparent power
S decreasing (from 0a to 0b in Figure 26.16(b)) and thus
the current decreasing, so that the power distribution
system is used more efficiently.

Another method of power factor improvement,
besides the use of static capacitors, is by using syn-
chronous motors; such machines can be made to operate
at leading power factors.

Problem 6. A 300kVA transformer is at full load
with an overall power factor of 0.70 lagging. The
power factor is improved by adding capacitors in
parallel with the transformer until the overall power
factor becomes 0.90 lagging. Determine the rating
(in kilovars) of the capacitors required.

to change from Ocb (see Figure 26.19) to Oab,

Chapter 27

A.c. bridges

Why it is important to understand: A.c. bridges

A.c. bridges are used for measuring the values of inductors and capacitors or for converting the signals
measured from inductive or capacitive components into a suitable form such as a voltage. Inductors and
capacitors can also be measured using an approximate method of voltage division. These methods are
discussed in this chapter for a number of bridge circuits for which complex numbers are needed for the
determination of unknown component values. Impedance bridges work the same way as a Wheatstone
bridge, which measures resistance, only the balance equation is with complex quantities, as both magni-
tude and phase across the components of the two dividers must be equal in order for the null detector
to indicate zero. The null detector must be a device capable of detecting very small a.c. voltages. An
oscilloscope is often used for this, although very sensitive electromechanical meter movements and even
headphones (small speakers) may be used if the source frequency is within audio range.

27.1 Introduction

A.C. bridges are electrical networks, based upon an
extension of the Wheatstone* bridge principle, used
for the determination of an unknown impedance by
comparison with known impedances and for the deter-
mination of frequency. In general, they contain four
impedance arms, an a.c. power supply and a balance
detector which is sensitive to alternating currents. It is
more difficult to achieve balance in an a.c. bridge than in
a d.c. bridge because both the magnitude and the phase
angle of impedances are related to the balance condition.

Balance equations are derived by using complex num-
bers. A.c. bridges provide precise methods of mea-
surement of inductance and capacitance, as well as
resistance.

27.2 Balance conditions for an a.c.

bridge

The majority of well known a.c. bridges are classified as
four-arm bridges and consist of an arrangement of four
impedances (in complex form, Z = R + jX), as shown in

Figure 27.1 Four-arm bridge

Figure 27.1. As with the d.c. Wheatstone bridge circuit,
an a.c. bridge is said to be ‘balanced’ when the cur-
rent through the detector is zero (i.e. when no current
flows between B and D of Figure 27.1). If the current
through the detector is zero, then the current J; flowing
in impedance Z must also flow in impedance Z. Also,
at balance, the current /4 flowing in impedance Z4, must
also flow through Z3

At balance:

(i) the volt drop between A and B is equal to the volt
drop between A and D,

le. Vap = Vap

ie. 1,2, = 14Z,4 (both in magnitude and
in phase) (1)

(ii) the volt drop between B and C is equal to the volt
drop between D and C,

le. Vpc=Vpc

ie. [)Z2 = 14Z3 (both in magnitude and
in phase) (2)

Dividing equation (1) by equation (2) gives

IZ, _ 14Z4
{Zo ~ 14Z3
., Zi L4
from which — = —
Z2 23
or Z1Z3 =Z2Z4 (3)

Equation (3) shows that at balance the products of the
impedances of opposite arms of the bridge are equal.
If in polar form, Z,;=|Z,|Za,, Z2=|Z2|Zaz,
Z3=|Z3|Za3, and Z4=|Za4|Za4, then from equa-
tion (3), (|Z1|Za1)(|Z3|2a3) = (|Z2|Za2)(|Z4|Za4),
which shows that there are two conditions to be satisfied
simultaneously for balance in an a.c. bridge, i.e.

IZ1| 1Z3| = |Z2I|Z4| and ay +a3 =a +04

When deriving balance equations of a.c. bridges, where
at least two of the impedances are in complex form, it
is important to appreciate that for a complex equation
a+jb=c-+jd the real parts are equal, i.e. a=c, and the
imaginary parts are equal, i.e. b=d

Usually one arm of an a.c. bridge circuit contains
the unknown impedance while the other arms contain
known fixed or variable components. Normally only
two components of the bridge are variable. When bal-
ancing a bridge circuit, the current in the detector is
gradually reduced to zero by successive adjustments of
the two variable components. At balance, the unknown
impedance can be expressed in terms of the fixed and
variable components.

Procedure for determining the balance
equations of any a.c. bridge circuit

(i) Determine for the bridge circuit the impedance
in each arm in complex form and write down the
balance equation as in equation (3). Equations
are usually easier to manipulate if L and C are
initially expressed as X,, and Xc, rather than oL
or I{@C)

(ii) Isolate the unknown terms on the left-hand side
of the equation in the form a+ jb

(iii) Manipulate the terms on the right-hand side of the
equation into the form c+jd

(iv) Equate the real parts of the equation, i.e. a=c,
and equate the imaginary parts of the equation,
ie.b=d

(v) Substitute wL for X; and 1X@C) for X- where
appropriate and express the final equations in their
simplest form.

Types of detector used with a.c. bridges vary with the
type of bridge and with the frequency at which it is
operated. Common detectors used include:

(i) an oscilloscope, which is suitable for use with a
very wide range of frequencies;

(ii) earphones (or telephone headsets), which are suit-
able for frequencies up to about 10 kHz and are
used often at about 1 kHz, in which region the
human ear is very sensitive;

(iii) various electronic detectors, which use tuned cir-
cuits to detect current at the correct frequency; and

A.c. bridges 393

(iv) vibration galvanometers, which are usually used
for mains-operated bridges. This type of detec-
tor consists basically of a narrow moving coil
which is suspended on a fine phosphor bronze
wire between the poles of a magnet. When a
current of the correct frequency flows through
the coil, it is set into vibration. This is because
the mechanical resonant frequency of the sus-
pension is purposely made equal to the electrical
frequency of the coil current. A mirror attached
to the coil reflects a spot of light on to a scale, and
when the coil is vibrating the spot appears as an
extended beam of light. When the band reduces
to a spot the bridge is balanced. Vibration gal-
vanometers are available in the frequency range
10 Hz to 300 Hz.

27.3 Types of a.c. bridge circuit

A large number of bridge circuits have been developed,
each of which has some particular advantage under cer-
tain conditions. Some of the most important a.c. bridges
include the Maxwell, Hay, Owen and Maxwell-Wien
bridges for measuring inductance, the De Sauty and
Schering bridges for measuring capacitance, and the
Wien bridge for measuring frequency. Obviously a large
number of combinations of components in bridges is
possible.

In many bridges it is found that two of the balancing
impedances will be of the same nature, and often consist
of standard non-inductive resistors.

For a bridge to balance quickly the requirement is either:

(i) the adjacent arms are both pure components (i.e.
either both resistors, or both pure capacitors, or
one of each) — this type of bridge being called a
ratio-arm bridge (see, for example, paras (a), (c),
(e) and (g) below); or

(ii) apair of opposite arms are pure components — this
type of bridge being called a product-arm bridge
(see, for example, paras (b), (d) and (f) below).

A ratio-arm bridge can only be used to measure
reactive quantities of the same type. When using a
product-arm bridge the reactive component of the bal-
ancing impedance must be of opposite sign to the
unknown reactive component.

A commercial or universal bridge is available and
can be used to measure resistance, inductance or capa-
citance.

(a) The simple Maxwell* bridge

This bridge is used to measure the resistance and
inductance of a coil having a high Q-factor (where
Q-factor=@L/R, see Chapters 15 and 28).

A coil having unknown resistance R, and inductance
L, is shown in the circuit diagram of a simple Maxwell
bridge in Figure 27.2. R4 and L4 represent a standard
coil having known variable values. At balance, expres-
sions for R;, and L, may be derived in terms of known
components R2, R3, R4 and L4

Figure 27.2 Simple Maxwell bridge
The procedure for determining the balance equations
given in Section 27.2 may be followed.

G) From Figure 27.2, Zy=Ry+jXzi,, Z2=R2,
Z3 = R3 and Z4= R4+jXz,

At balance,

(Zx)(Z3) = (Z2)(Za),
from equation (3),
ie. (Ry +jX7,)(R3) = (R2)(R4 +jXz,)

(ii) Isolating the unknown impedance on the left-hand
side of the equation gives

; Ro ;
(Ry +jX1,) = Rs +jX7,)

(iii) Manipulating the right-hand side of the equation
into (a+ jb) form gives

These are known as the ‘balance equations’ for the

(b) The Hay bridge

This bridge is used to measure the resistance and induct-
ance of a coil having a very high Q-factor. A coil having
unknown resistance R, and inductance L, is shown in
the circuit diagram of a Hay bridge in Figure 27.3.

Following the procedure of Section 27.2 gives:

(i) From Figure 27.3, Z,; =R,+jXz,, Z2=R2,
Z3 = R3 —jXc,, and Z4= Ry

Since w(=2z/f) appears in the balance equations, the

(c) The Owen bridge

This bridge is used to measure the resistance and
inductance of coils possessing a large value of induc-
tance. A coil having unknown resistance R, and induc-
tance L, is shown in the circuit diagram of an Owen
bridge in Figure 27.4, from which Z,=R,+/X_z,,
Z2 = R2 —jXc,, Z3 =—jXc, and Z4= R4

At balance (Z,.)(Z3) =(Z2)(Za), from equation (3), i.e.

Rearranging gives Ry +jX1, = (Re = Pho,) Ra

By rationalizing and equating real and imaginary
parts it may be shown that at balance the unknown
components in the Owen bridge are given by

This bridge is used to measure the resistance and induct-
ance of a coil having a low Q-factor. A coil having

in the circuit diagram of a Maxwell-Wien bridge in

Figure 27.6, Cy is an unknown capacitance and C4 is a
standard capacitor.

This simple bridge is usually inadequate in most practi-
cal cases. The power factor of the capacitor under test is
significant because of internal dielectric losses — these
losses being the dissipation within a dielectric material
when an alternating voltage is applied to a capacitor.

(f) The Schering bridge

This bridge is used to measure the capacitance and
equivalent series resistance of a capacitor. From the
measured values the power factor of insulating materials
and dielectric losses may be determined. In the circuit
diagram of a Schering bridge shown in Figure 27.7, Cy
is the unknown capacitance and R,, its equivalent series
resistance.

known components (or, alternatively, to measure capac-
itance if the frequency is known). It may also be used
as a frequency-stabilizing network.

Series resonance and
Q-factor

Series resonance circuits are one of the most important circuits used in electrical and electronic engi-
neering. They can be found in various forms, such as in a.c. mains filters, noise filters and also in radio
and television tuning circuits, producing a very selective tuning circuit for the receiving of the different
frequency channels. Resonance may be achieved either by varying the frequency or by varying one of the
components, usually the capacitance, until the inductive and capacitive reactances are equal. Resonance
makes the circuit respond in a markedly different manner at the resonance frequency than at other
frequencies, a behaviour which is a basis of the selection process used in many communications systems,
such as the tuning of a radio. Resonance, Q-factor, bandwidth and selectivity in a.c. series circuits are
explained in this chapter

402 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

28.1 Introduction

When the voltage V applied to an electrical network
containing resistance, inductance and capacitance is in
phase with the resulting current /, the circuit is said to
be resonant. The phenomenon of resonance is of great
value in all branches of radio, television and communi-
cations engineering, since it enables small portions of
the communications frequency spectrum to be selected
for amplification independently of the remainder.

At resonance, the equivalent network impedance Z
is purely resistive since the supply voltage and current
are in phase. The power factor of a resonant network is
unity (i.e. power factor = cos ¢ = cos 0 = 1)

In electrical work there are two types of resonance —
one associated with series circuits (which was intro-
duced in Chapter 15), when the input impedance is
a minimum (which is discussed further in this chapter),
and the other associated with simple parallel networks,
when the input impedance is a maximum (which was
discussed in Chapter 16 and is further discussed in
Chapter 29).

28.2 Series resonance

Figure 28.1 shows a circuit comprising a coil of induc-
tance L and resistance R connected in series with
a capacitor C. The R—-L-C series circuit has a total
impedance Z given by Z = R+ j(Xz, — Xc) ohms, or
Z = R+ j(@L — 1/C) ohms where w = 22 f . The cir-
cuit is at resonance when (X;, — Xc) =0, i.e. when
Xz. = Xc or aL = 1K@C). The phasor diagram for this

condition is shown in Figure 28.2, where |Vz| = |Vc|

impedance Z = R+ j(Xz, — Xc) and, at resonance,
(Xz, — Xc) = 0, then impedance Z=R at resonance.
This is the minimum value possible for the impedance

The circuit possesses stray capacitance Cs which is
assumed to be constant and effectively in parallel

set to 1000 pF the resonant frequency of the circuit
is 92.5 kHz, and when the capacitor is set to 500 pF
the resonant frequency is 127.8 kHz. Determine the

the capacitor is set to 1.0nF the resonant fre-
quency is 120kHz. Determine the values of
(a) the stray circuit capacitance Cs and (b) the
coil inductance L.

28.3 Q-factor

Q-factor is a figure of merit for a resonant device such
as an L—C-R circuit.

Such a circuit resonates by cyclic interchange of stored
energy, accompanied by energy dissipation due to the
resistance.

By definition, at resonance

O=2 maximum energy stored
= 270
energy loss per cycle

Since the energy loss per cycle is equal to (the average
power dissipated) x (periodic time),

O=2 maximum energy stored
= 270 —_ 1» A>
average power dissipated x periodic time

D maximum energy stored
=27
average power dissipated x (1/f,)

since the periodic time T = 1/f,

Thus Q=27zf, (

maximum energy stored
average power dissipated

i.e. Q=0a, (

maximum energy stored
average power dissipated

where @, is the angular frequency at resonance.

In an L—C-R circuit both of the reactive elements
store energy during a quarter cycle of the alternating
supply input and return it to the circuit source during
the following quarter cycle. An inductor stores energy
in its magnetic field, then transfers it to the electric field
of the capacitor and then back to the magnetic field,
and so on. Thus the inductive and capacitive elements
transfer energy from one to the other successively with
the source of supply ideally providing no additional
energy at all. Practical reactors both store and dissipate
energy.

Q-factor is an abbreviation for quality factor and refers
to the ‘goodness’ of a reactive component.

In an R-L-C series circuit the amount of energy stored

It should be noted that when Q-factor is referred to,
it is nearly always assumed to mean ‘the Q-factor at

Hence, at resonance, V, = Vc = Q,;V

Vz (or Vc)
or 0, = yy

The voltages Vi and Vc at resonance may be much
greater than that of the supply voltage V. For this reason
Q is often called the circuit magnification factor. It
represents a measure of the number of times Vz or Vc
is greater than the supply voltage.

The Q-factor at resonance can have a value of several
hundreds. Resonance is usually of interest only in cir-
cuits of Q-factor greater than about 10; circuits having
Q considerably below this value are effectively merely
operating at unity power factor.

Problem 4. A series circuit comprises a 10Q
resistance, a 5 |1F capacitor and a variable
inductance L. The supply voltage is 200° volts at
a frequency of 318.3 Hz. The inductance is adjusted
until the p.d. across the 10 resistance is a
maximum. Determine for this condition (a) the
value of inductance L, (b) the p.d. across each
component and (c) the Q-factor.

(a) The maximum voltage across the resistance occurs
at resonance when the current is a maximum.

28.4 Voltage magnification

For a circuit with a high value of Q (say, exceeding
100), the maximum volt drop across the coil, VcomL,
and the maximum volt drop across the capacitor, Vc,
coincide with the maximum circuit current at the
resonant frequency, f-, as shown in Figure 28.5(a).
However, if a circuit of low Q (say, less than 10) is used,
it may be shown experimentally that the maximum
value of Vc occurs at a frequency less than f, while the
maximum value of Vcor occurs at a frequency higher
than f-, as shown in Figure 28.5(b). The maximum
current, however, still occurs at the resonant frequency
with low Q. This is analysed below.

Selectivity is the ability of a circuit to respond more
readily to signals of a particular frequency to which it is
tuned than to signals of other frequencies. The response
becomes progressively weaker as the frequency departs
from the resonant frequency. Discrimination against
other signals becomes more pronounced as circuit losses
are reduced, i.e. as the Q-factor is increased. Thus
QO, = fr/(f2 — fi) is a measure of the circuit selectivity
in terms of the points on each side of resonance where
the circuit current has fallen to 0.707 of its maximum
value reached at resonance. The higher the Q-factor,
the narrower the bandwidth and the more selective is
the circuit. Circuits having high Q-factors (say, in the
order 300) are therefore useful in communications engi-
neering. A high Q-factor in a series power circuit has
disadvantages in that it can lead to dangerously high
voltages across the insulation and may result in electrical
breakdown.

For example, suppose that the working voltage of a
capacitor is stated as 1 kV and is used in a circuit having
a supply voltage of 240 V. The maximum value of the
supply will be ./2(240), i.e. 340 V. The working voltage
of the capacitor would appear to be ample. However, if
the Q-factor is, say, 10, the voltage across the capacitor
will reach 2.4kV. Since the capacitor is rated only at
1kV, dielectric breakdown is more than likely to occur.

Low Q-factors, say, in the order of 5 to 25, may be
found in power transformers using laminated iron cores.

A capacitor-start induction motor, as used in domestic
appliances such as washing machines and vacuum-
cleaners, having a Q-factor as low as 1.5 at starting
would result in a voltage across the capacitor 1.5 times
that of the supply voltage; hence the cable joining the
capacitor to the motor would require extra insulation.

Note that the upper and lower half-power fre-

Parallel resonance and

Why it is important to understand: Parallel resonance and Q-factor

There are three basic conditions in a parallel circuit; dependent on frequency and component values,
the circuit will be operating below, above or at resonance. This chapter investigates the conditions for
parallel resonance, and explains dynamic impedance, Q-factor and bandwidth. One use for resonance
is to establish a condition of stable frequency in circuits designed to produce a.c. signals. Usually, a
parallel circuit is used for this purpose, with the capacitor and inductor directly connected together,
exchanging energy between each other. Just as a pendulum can be used to stabilise the frequency of a
clock mechanism’s oscillations, so can a parallel circuit be used to stabilise the electrical frequency of an
a.c. oscillator circuit. Another use for resonance is in applications where the effects of greatly increased
or decreased impedance at a particular frequency are desired. A resonant circuit can be used to block a
frequency or range of frequencies, thus acting as a sort of frequency filter to strain certain frequencies
out of a mix of others; these particular circuits are called filters.

Q-factor

29.1 Introduction

A parallel network containing resistance R, pure induct-
ance L and pure capacitance C connected in parallel is
shown in Figure 29.1. Since the inductance and capaci-
tance are considered as pure components, this circuit is
something of an ‘ideal’ circuit. However, it may be used

to highlight some important points regarding resonance
which are applicable to any parallel circuit.

Parallel resonance and Q-factor 417

From the ideal circuit of Figure 29.1 we have there-
fore established the following facts which apply to any
parallel circuit. At resonance:

(i) admittance Y is a minimum
(ii) impedance Z is amaximum
(iii) current J is a minimum
(iv) anexpression for the resonant frequency f, may
be obtained by making the ‘imaginary’ part of
the complex expression for admittance equal to
zero.

29.2 The LR-C parallel network

A more practical network, containing a coil of induc-
tance L and resistance R in parallel with a pure
capacitance C, is shown in Figure 29.3.

above method may be applied to any parallel network,
as demonstrated in Section 29.4 below.

29.3 Dynamic resistance

Since the current at resonance is in phase with the volt-
age, the impedance of the network acts as a resistance.
This resistance is known as the dynamic resistance,
Rp. Impedance at resonance, Rp = V/I,, where I, is the
current at resonance.

29.5 Q-factor in a parallel network

The Q-factor in the series R-L-C circuit is a measure
of the voltage magnification. In a parallel circuit, cur-
rents higher than the supply current can circulate within
the parallel branches of a parallel resonant network, the
current leaving the capacitor and establishing the mag-
netic field of the inductance, this then collapsing and
recharging the capacitor, and so on. The Q-factor of a
parallel resonant circuit is the ratio of the current circu-
lating in the parallel branches of the circuit to the supply
current, i.e. in a parallel circuit, Q-factor is a measure
of the current magnification.

Figure 29.5

Circulating currents may be several hundreds of
times greater than the supply current at resonance. For
the parallel network of Figure 29.5, the Q-factor at

the same expression as for series resonance.

The difference between the resonant frequency of
a series circuit and that of a parallel circuit can be
quite small. The resonant frequency of a coil in par-
allel with a capacitor is shown in equation (3); however,
around the closed loop comprising the coil and capac-
itor the energy would naturally resonate at a frequency
given by that for a series R-L-C circuit, as shown in
Chapter 28. This latter frequency is termed the natural
frequency, fn, and the frequency of resonance seen at
the terminals of Figure 29.5 is often called the forced
resonant frequency, f,. (For a series circuit, the forced
and natural frequencies coincide.)

From the coil—capacitor loop of Figure 29.5,

i.e. f. =hn|(1 - ra)

Thus it is seen that even with small values of Q the
difference between f, and f, tends to be very small.
A high value of Q makes the parallel resonant frequency
tend to the same value as that of the series resonant
frequency.

as for the series circuit.

By similar reasoning to that of the series R-L-C circuit,
it may be shown that at the half-power frequencies the
admittance is ,/2 times its minimum value at resonance
and, since Z =1/Y, the value of impedance at the half-
power frequencies is 1//2 or 0.707 times its maximum
value at resonance.

By similar analysis to that given in Chapter 28, it may
be shown that for a parallel network:

Introduction to network

Why it is important to understand: Introduction to network analysis

Network analysis is any structured technique used to mathematically analyse a circuit or a network of
interconnected components. Quite often a technician or engineer will encounter circuits containing mul-
tiple sources of power or component configurations which defy simplification by series/parallel analysis
techniques using Ohm’s law. In such cases, other means are required. This and the following chapters
present some techniques useful in analysing such complex circuits. These are a collection of techniques for
finding the voltages and currents in every component of the network. Network analysis is the process by
which designers and manufacturers measure the electrical performance of the components and circuits
used in more complex systems. When these systems are conveying signals with information content, there
is a concern with getting the signal from one point to another with maximum efficiency and minimum
distortion. This chapter introduces the techniques of network analysis, solves simultaneous equations in
two and three unknowns, and uses Kirchhoff’s laws to determine unknown values of branch currents.

analysis

30.1 Introduction

Voltage sources in series—parallel networks cause cur-
rents to flow in each branch of the circuit and
corresponding volt drops occur across the circuit com-
ponents. A.c. circuit (or network) analysis involves the
determination of the currents in the branches and/or the
voltages across components.

The laws which determine the currents and voltage
drops in a.c. networks are:

(a)

(b)

current, T=V/Z, where Z is the complex
impedance and V _ the voltage across the
impedance;

the laws for impedances in series and parallel,
i.e. total impedance,

and for n impe-

(c) Kirchhoff’s laws, which may be stated as:

(i) ‘Atany pointinan electrical circuit the phasor
sum of the currents flowing towards that junc-
tion is equal to the phasor sum of the currents
flowing away from the junction.’

(ii) ‘In any closed loop in a network, the phasor
sum of the voltage drops (i.e. the products of
current and impedance) taken around the loop
is equal to the phasor sum of the e.m.f:s acting
in that loop.’

In any circuit the currents and voltages at any point may
be determined by applying Kirchhoff’s laws (as demon-
strated in this chapter), or by extensions of Kirchhoff’s
laws, called mesh-current analysis and nodal analysis
(see Chapter 31).

However, for more complicated circuits, a number of
circuit theorems have been developed as alternatives to
the use of Kirchhoff’s laws to solve problems involving
both d.c. and a.c. electrical networks. These include:

(a) the superposition theorem (see Chapter 32)
(b) Thévenin’s theorem (see Chapter 33)
(c) Norton’s theorem (see Chapter 33)

(d) the maximum power transfer theorems (see
Chapter 35).

In addition to these theorems, and often used as a prelim-
inary to using circuit theorems, star—delta (or T — 2 ) and
delta—star (or z — T) transformations provide a method
for simplifying certain circuits (see Chapter 34).

In a.c. circuit analysis involving Kirchhoff’s laws
or circuit theorems, the use of complex numbers is
essential.

The above laws and theorems apply to linear cir-
cuits, i.e. circuits containing impedances whose values
are independent of the direction and magnitude of the
current flowing in them.

30.2 Solution of simultaneous

equations using determinants

When Kirchhoff’s laws are applied to electrical circuits,
simultaneous equations result which require solution.
If two loops are involved, two simultaneous equations
containing two unknowns need to be solved; if three

loops are involved, three simultaneous equations con-
taining three unknowns need to be solved and so on.
The elimination and substitution methods of solving
simultaneous equations may be used to solve such equa-
tions. However, a more convenient method is to use
determinants.

Two unknowns

unknowns using determinants:

(i) the equations are initially written in the form:

i.e. the determinant of the coefficients left when

To evaluate a 3 x 3 determinant:

(a) The minor of an element of a 3 by 3 matrix is
the value of the 2 by 2 determinant obtained by
covering up the row and column containing that
element.

Thus for the matrix | 4 5 6 ] the minor of

element 4 is the determinant

ie. (2x 9)—(3 x 8)=18—24=—-6
Similarly, the minor of element 3 is

ie. (4x 8)—(5 x 7) =32 -—35=-3

(b) The sign of the minor depends on its posi-
tion within the matrix, the sign pattern being

+ - +
— + — |. Thus the signed minor of element

4 in the above matrix is — | 8 5 | =—(—6)=6

The signed-minor of an element is called the
cofactor of the element.
Thus the cofactor of element 2 is

(c) The value of a 3 by 3 determinant is the sum of
the products of the elements and their cofactors
of any row or any column of the corresponding
3 by 3 matrix.

30.3 Network analysis using

Kirchhoff’s laws

Kirchhoff’s* laws may be applied to both d.c. and
a.c. circuits. The laws are introduced in Chapter 13 for
d.c. circuits. To demonstrate the method of analysis,
consider the d.c. network shown in Figure 30.1. If the
current flowing in each branch is required, the following
three-step procedure may be used:

(i) Label branch currents and their directions on
the circuit diagram. The directions chosen are
arbitrary but, as a starting point, a useful guide
is to assume that current flows from the positive
terminals of the voltage sources. This is shown

in Figure 30.2 where the three branch currents
are expressed in terms of J; and J only, since
the current through resistance R, by Kirchhoff’s
current law, is (] + 1).

Figure 30.2

(ii) Divide the circuit into loops — two in this case (see
Figure 30.2) and then apply Kirchhoff’s voltage
law to each loop in turn. From loop ABEF, and
moving in a clockwise direction (the choice of
loop direction is arbitrary), Fj} =r+(+12)R
(note that the two voltage drops are positive
since the loop direction is the same as the
current directions involved in the volt drops).
Hence

8=)4+514+ 1)
or 61, +5h =8 (1)

From loop BCDE in Figure 30.2, and moving in
an anticlockwise direction (note that the direction
does not have to be the same as that used for the
first loop), £2 =hr2+(14+h)R,

Le. 3=2h4+5() +h)

or 5h +7h=3 (2)

(iii) Solve simultaneous equations (1) and (2) for 1
and Jy.

Multiplying equation (1) by 7 gives:
421, + 35h =56 (3)

Multiplying equation (2) by 5 gives:
251, +35h = 15 (4)
Equation (3) — equation (4) gives:
171, =41

from which, current yj =41/17=2.412A=
2.41 A, correct to two decimal places.

From equation (1): 6(2.412)+5h=8, from
which,

8 —6(2.412)
current [2 = 5 =

1.294A

=—1.29A, correct to two decimal
places.

The minus sign indicates that current J) flows in the
opposite direction to that shown in Figure 30.2.

The current flowing through resistance R is

(1) +h) = 2.412 + (1.294) =1.118A

= 1.12A, correct to two decimal places.

[A third loop may be selected in Figure 30.2 (just as
a check), moving clockwise around the outside of the
network.

Then Ey — Ey=]r, — hr2 ie. 8-—3=1, —2h. Thus

Introduction to network analysis 431

The above procedure is shown for a simple d.c. circuit
having two unknown values of current. The procedure,
however, applies equally well to a.c. networks and/or
to circuits where three unknown currents are involved.
This is illustrated in the following problems.

Problem 1. Use Kirchhoff’s laws to find the
current flowing in each branch of the network
shown in Figure 30.3.

Figure 30.3

(i) The branch currents and their directions are
labelled as shown in Figure 30.4

(ii) Two loops are chosen. From loop ABEF, and
moving clockwise,

251, +20( + 2) = 10020°
Le. 451, +201 = 100 (1)
From loop BCDE, and moving anticlockwise,
105 +20) + 2) = 50290°
Le. 201 +3012 = j50 (2)

3 x equation (1) gives: 1351, + 60/2 = 300 (3)
2 x equation (2) gives: 401; + 60/2 = 7100 (4)

Equation (3) — equation (4) gives:

951, = 300 — 7100

300 — j 100

= 3.3292—18.43° A or

(3.158—j1.052) A

from which, current 1; =

Substituting in equation (1) gives:
45(3.158 — 71.052) +20J) = 100, from which,

7, 100 = 453.158 ~ j1.052)
= 20
= (—2.106 +j2.367) A or 3.1682131.66° A

Thus

I + ly = (3.158 — 1.052) + (2.106 + j2.367)
= (1.052 +1.315) A or 1.684251.34° A

dissipated in the 3 Q resistance.

Mesh-current and nodal
analysis

Why it is important to understand: Mesh-current and nodal analysis

When circuits become large and complicated, it is useful to have various methods for simplifying and
analysing the circuit. There is no perfect formula for solving a circuit; depending on the type of circuit,
there are different methods that can be employed to solve the circuit. Some methods might not work,
and some methods may be very difficult in terms of long mathematical problems. Two of the most
important methods for solving circuits are mesh current analysis and nodal analysis. Mesh analysis is the
application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law to solve for mesh currents, whereas nodal analysis is the application
of Kirchhoff’s current law to solve for the voltages at each node in a network. Mesh analysis is often easier
as it requires fewer unknowns. This chapter demonstrates how to solve d.c. and a.c. networks using mesh
and nodal analysis.

31.1 Mesh-current analysis

Mesh-current analysis is merely an extension of the
use of Kirchhoff’s laws, explained in Chapter 30.
Figure 31.1 shows a network whose circulating currents
I, ly and J; have been assigned to closed loops in the
circuit rather than to branches. Currents [1, Jy and J3 are
called mesh-currents or loop-currents.

In mesh-current analysis the loop-currents are
all arranged to circulate in the same direction (in Figure 31.1

Figure 31.1, shown as clockwise direction). Kirchhoff’s
second law is applied to each of the loops in turn, which
in the circuit of Figure 31.1 produces three equations in
three unknowns which may be solved for /,, J> and Js.
The three equations produced from Figure 31.1 are:

I\(Z1 + Z2)-hZ.= EF
In(Z2 + Z3 + Z4) — 1 Z2 —Z4 =0
(Z4+ Zs) —hZ4=—E2

The branch currents are determined by taking the pha-
sor sum of the mesh currents common to that branch.
For example, the current flowing in impedance Z2 of
Figure 31.1 is given by (/; — /2) phasorially. The method
of mesh-current analysis, called Maxwell’s theorem, is
demonstrated in the following problems.

Problem 1. Use mesh-current analysis to
determine the current flowing in (a) the 5Q
resistance and (b) the 1 Q resistance of the d.c.
circuit shown in Figure 31.2.

31.2 Nodal analysis

A node of a network is defined as a point where two
or more branches are joined. If three or more branches
join at a node, then that node is called a principal node
or junction. In Figure 31.13, points 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are
nodes, and points 1, 2 and 3 are principal nodes.

Figure 31.13


442 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

A node voltage is the voltage of a particular node
with respect to a node called the reference node. If in
Figure 31.13, for example, node 3 is chosen as the ref-
erence node then V3 is assumed to mean the voltage
at node | with respect to node 3 (as distinct from V3,).
Similarly, V23 would be assumed to mean the voltage
at node 2 with respect to node 3, and so on. However,
since the node voltage is always determined with respect
to a particular chosen reference node, the notation Vi
for Vj3 and V2 for V23 would always be used in this
instance.

The object of nodal analysis is to determine the val-
ues of voltages at all the principal nodes with respect
to the reference node, e.g., to find voltages V; and
V2 in Figure 31.13. When such voltages are deter-
mined, the currents flowing in each branch can be
found.

Kirchhoff’s current law is applied to nodes 1 and 2
in turn in Figure 31.13 and two equations in unknowns
VY, and V2 are obtained which may be simultaneously
solved using determinants.

Za 1 2g 2

Vy | Zo

Figure 31.14

The branches leading to node | are shown separately
in Figure 31.14. Let us assume that all branch currents
are leaving the node as shown. Since the sum of currents
at a junction is zero,

Vi- V2 _

Vi -— Vy 1 Vi

0 (1)
Similarly, for node 2, assuming all branch currents are
leaving the node as shown in Figure 31.15,

Vo —V, V: V4+V
2 ty a4 2 y_
ZB ZE Zc

0 (2)

In equations (1) and (2), the currents are all assumed to
be leaving the node. In fact, any selection in the direc-
tion of the branch currents may be made — the resulting
equations will be identical. (For example, if for node
1 the current flowing in Zg is considered as flowing
towards node | instead of away, then the equation for
node | becomes

Mia Vs | VM V2-—V1
ZA ZD ZB

which if rearranged is seen to be exactly the same as
equation (1).

Figure 31.15

Rearranging equations (1) and (2) gives:

1 1 1 1 1
(72+ Z5 +z) (Z)e-(z) =
(3)
-(Z)ut(etatz)et(gZ)y-e

ZB Zp Zc Ze Zc
(4)

Equations (3) and (4) may be rewritten in terms of
admittances (where admittance Y =1/Z):

(Ya + Y¥e4+Yp)Vi — YeV2 — YaVy =0 (5)
—YpV, + (Vp +Y¥c+Yer)V2+Y¥cVy =0 (6)

Equations (5) and (6) may be solved for V; and V2 by
using determinants. Thus

~ |(Ya+Y¥e+Yp) —Ya
—Ypz Yc

~ |(Ya+¥e+Yp) —Ypz
—Yp (Ye +Y¥c+Ye)

Current equations, and hence voltage equations, may
be written at each principal node of a network with the
exception of a reference node. The number of equations
necessary to produce a solution for a circuit is, in fact,
always one less than the number of principal nodes.
Whether mesh-current analysis or nodal analysis
is used to determine currents in circuits depends on
the number of loops and nodes the circuit contains.

Mesh-current and nodal analysis

Basically, the method that requires the least number
of equations is used. The method of nodal analysis is
demonstrated in the following problems.

Problem 4. For the network shown in

Figure 31.16, determine the voltage Vaz, by using
nodal analysis.

Figure 31.16

Figure 31.16 contains two principal nodes (at 1 and B)
and thus only one nodal equation is required. B is taken
as the reference node and the equation for node | is

obtained as follows. Applying Kirchhoff’s current law
to node | gives:

Chapter 32

The superposition theorem

Why it is important to understand: The superposition theorem

The strategy used in the superposition theorem is to eliminate all but one voltage source within a network
at a time, using series/parallel circuit analysis to determine voltage drops, and/or currents, within the
modified network for each voltage source separately. Then, once voltage drops and/or currents have been
determined for each voltage source working separately, the values are all ‘superimposed’ on top of each
other, i.e. added algebraically, to determine the actual voltage drops/currents with all sources active. The
superposition theorem is very important in circuit analysis; it is used in converting any circuit into its
Norton equivalent or Thévenin equivalent (which will be explained in the next chapter).

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

e solve d.c. and a.c. networks using the superposition theorem

32.1 Introduction

The superposition theorem states:

‘In any network made up of linear impedances and
containing more than one source of e.mf. the resul-
tant current flowing in any branch is the phasor sum
of the currents that would flow in that branch if each
source were considered separately, all other sources
being replaced at that time by their respective internal
impedances.’

32.2 Using the superposition

theorem

The superposition theorem, which was introduced in
Chapter 13 for d.c. circuits, may be applied to both
d.c. and a.c. networks. A d.c. network is shown in
Figure 32.1 and will serve to demonstrate the principle
of application of the superposition theorem.

Figure 32.1

To find the current flowing in each branch of
the circuit, the following six-step procedure can be
adopted:

(i) Redraw the original network with one of the
sources, say E27, removed and replaced by r2 only,
as shown in Figure 32.2.

(ii) Label the current in each branch and its direc-
tion as shown in Figure 32.2, and then determine
its value. The choice of current direction for
I, depends on the source polarity which, by

Determine the algebraic sum of the currents flow-
ing in each branch. (Note that in an a.c. circuit it
is the phasor sum of the currents that is required.)

From Figure 32.6, the resultant current flowing
through the 8 V source is given by

I, -I6 = 3.294—0.8825=2.41A (discharging,
i.e. flowing from the positive terminal of the
source).


450 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

The resultant current flowing in the 3 V source is
given by

I; —I4=2.353—1.059 =1.29A (charging, i.e.
flowing into the positive terminal of the source).

The resultant current flowing in the 5 Q resistance
is given by

bh+15 =0.9414+0.177=1.12A

The values of current are the same as those
obtained on page 430 by using Kirchhoff’s laws.

The following problems demonstrate further the use
of the superposition theorem in analysing a.c. as well
as d.c. networks. The theorem is straightforward to
apply, but is lengthy. Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems
(described in Chapter 33) produce results more quickly.

Problem 1. A.c. sources of 10020°V and internal
resistance 25 Q, and 50290°V and internal
resistance 10 Q, are connected in parallel across a
20 Q load. Determine using the superposition
theorem, the current in the 20 Q load and the
current in each voltage source.

(This is the same problem as Problem | on page 431 and
Problem 6 on page 443 and a comparison of methods
may be made.)

The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 32.7. Following
the above procedure:

through calculations.

Why it is important to understand: Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems

Two powerful circuit analysis techniques are Thévenin’s theorem and Norton’s theorem. Both theorems
convert a complex circuit to a simpler series or parallel equivalent circuit for easier analysis. Analysis
involves removing part of the circuit across two terminals to aid calculation, later combining the circuit
with the Thévenin or Norton equivalent circuit. Thévenin’s theorem was independently derived in 1853
by the German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1883 by Léon Charles Thévenin (1857-1926),
an electrical engineer with France’s national Postes et Télégraphes telecommunications organization.
Norton’s theorem is an extension of Thévenin’s theorem and was introduced in 1926 separately by two
people: Hause-Siemens researcher Hans Ferdinand Mayer (1895-1980) and Bell Labs engineer Edward
Lawry Norton (1898-1983). This chapter explains both theorems, analysing both d.c. and a.c. networks

theorems

33.1 Introduction

Many of the networks analysed in Chapters 30, 31 and
32 using Kirchhoff’s laws, mesh-current and nodal
analysis and the superposition theorem can be analysed
more quickly and easily by using Thévenin’s or Norton’s
theorems. Each of these theorems involves replacing

what may be a complicated network of sources and lin-
ear impedances with a simple equivalent circuit. A set
procedure may be followed when using each theorem,

basic circuit theory. (It may be worth checking some
general d.c. circuit theory in Section 13.4. page 172,
before proceeding.)

33.2 Thévenin’s theorem

Thévenin’s* theorem states:

‘The current which flows in any branch of a network is
the same as that which would flow in the branch if it
were connected across a source of electrical energy,
the e.mf. of which is equal to the potential differ-
ence which would appear across the branch if it were
open-circuited, and the internal impedance of which
is equal to the impedance which appears across the
open-circuited branch terminals when all sources are
replaced by their internal impedances.’

The theorem applies to any linear active network (‘lin-
ear’ meaning that the measured values of circuit com-
ponents are independent of the direction and magnitude
of the current flowing in them, and ‘active’ meaning that
it contains a source, or sources, of e.m.f.).

The above statement of Thévenin’s theorem simply
means that a complicated network with output termi-
nals AB, as shown in Figure 33.1(a), can be replaced by
a single voltage source EF in series with an impedance z,
as shown in Figure 33.1(b). E is the open-circuit volt-
age measured at terminals AB and z is the equivalent
impedance of the network at the terminals AB when all
internal sources of e.m.f. are made zero. The polarity of
voltage E is chosen so that the current flowing through
an impedance connected between A and B will have the
same direction as would result if the impedance had been

connected between A and B of the original network.
Figure 33.1(b) is known as the Thévenin equivalent
circuit, and was initially introduced in Section 13.4,
page 172 for d.c. networks.

The following four-step procedure can be adopted
when determining, by means of Thévenin’s theorem,
the current flowing in a branch containing impedance
Z_ of an active network:

(i) remove the impedance Z,; from that branch;

(ii) determine the open-circuit voltage E across the
break;

(iii) remove each source of e.m.f. and replace it by
its internal impedance (if it has zero internal
impedance then replace it by a short-circuit),
and then determine the internal impedance, z,
‘looking in’ at the break;

(iv) determine the current from the Thévenin equiva-
lent circuit shown in Figure 33.2, i.e.

current iy, =

A simple d.c. network (Figure 33.3) serves to demon-
strate how the above procedure is applied to determine
the current flowing in the 5Q resistance by using
Thévenin’s theorem. This is the same network as used
in Chapter 30 when it was solved using Kirchhoff’s
laws (see page 430), and by means of the superposition

methods may be made.
Using the above procedure:

(i) the 5Q resistor is removed, as shown in
Figure 33.4(a).

(ii) The open-circuit voltage E across the break is
now required. The network of Figure 33.4(a)

is redrawn for convenience as shown in

i.e. E =8— (13) (1) =64V
(Alternatively, E = Ey — (—I))r2
=3+ (13) (2) =64V)

(iii) Removing each source of e.m.f. gives the network
of Figure 33.5. The impedance, z, ‘looking in’ at
the break AB is given by

z= (1x 2M1+2)=$Q

To determine the currents flowing in the other two
branches of the circuit of Figure 33.3, basic circuit
theory is used. Thus, from Figure 33.7, voltage

Then V=E;, —Jy,ry, ie. 5.5885 = 8 — I4(1),

The Thévenin theorem procedure used above may be
applied to a.c. as well as d.c. networks, as shown below.

An a.c. network is shown in Figure 33.8, where it
is required to find the current flowing in the (6+ 78) Q
impedance by using Thévenin’s theorem.

quicker.

Assuming that point A is at a higher potential than
point B, then the p.d. between A and B is

21.83Z—14.04° — 18.97Z—18.43°
= (3.181 + j0.701) V or 3.25712.43°V,

i.e. the open-circuit voltage across A B is given by

E =3.257212.43°V

(iii)

Point C is at a potential of 300° V. Between C
and A is a volt drop of 21.83 7—14.04° V. Hence
the voltage at point A is

3020° — 21.83 2—14.04° = 10.29230.98° V

Between points C and B is a voltage drop of
18.972Z—18.43° V. Hence the voltage at point B
is 3020° — 18.977—18.43° = 13.42226.55° V.

Since the magnitude of the voltage at B is higher
than at A, current must flow in the direction B
to A.

Replacing the 300° V source with a short-circuit
(i.e. zero internal impedance) gives the network
shown in Figure 33.42(a). The network is shown
redrawn in Figure 33.42(b) and simplified in

33.4 Norton’s theorem

A source of electrical energy can be represented by
a source of e.m.f. in series with an impedance. In
Section 33.2, the Thévenin constant-voltage source
consisted of a constant e.m.f., E, which may be alter-
nating or direct, in series with an internal impedance, z.


470 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

However, this is not the only form of representation.
A source of electrical energy can also be represented
by a constant-current source, which may be alternating
or direct, in parallel with an impedance. It is shown in
Section 33.5 that the two forms are in fact equivalent.

Norton’s* theorem states:

‘The current that flows in any branch of a network is the
same as that which would flow in the branch if it were
connected across a source of electrical energy, the short-
circuit current of which is equal to the current that would
flow ina short-circuit across the branch, and the internal
impedance of which is equal to the impedance which
appears across the open-circuited branch terminals.’

The above statement simply means that any linear
active network with output terminals AB, as shown
in Figure 33.48(a), can be replaced by a current
source in parallel with an impedance z as shown in
Figure 33.48(b). The equivalent current source Isc (note
the symbol in Figure 33.48(b) as per BS EN 60617-
2:1996) is the current through a short-circuit applied
to the terminals of the network. The impedance z is
the equivalent impedance of the network at the termi-
nals AB when all internal sources of e.m.f. are made
zero. Figure 33.48(b) is known as the Norton equiva-
lent circuit, and was initially introduced in Section 13.7,
page 178 for d.c. networks.

The following four-step procedure may be adopted
when determining the current flowing in an impedance
Z, of abranch AB of an active network, using Norton’s
theorem:

“Who was Norton? Go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

(i) short-circuit branch AB
(ii) determine the short-circuit current Isc

(iii) remove each source of e.m.f. and replace it by
its internal impedance (or, if a current source
exists, replace with an open circuit), then deter-
mine the impedance, z, ‘looking in’ at a break
made between A and B

the superposition theorem and by Thévenin’s
theorem.

Chapter 34

Delta—star and star—delta
transformations

Why it is important to understand: Delta-star and star—delta transforms

There are many popular circuit configurations; two such commonly used configurations are star-
connected networks and delta-connected networks. A star-connected network is also referred to as the T
network. Similarly, the delta-connected network is also referred to as the x network. The star-connected
and delta-connected configurations are used often and a complex circuit may contain such configurations
within the circuit. In order to analyse such a complex circuit, it is at times necessary to transform a star-
connected configuration within the circuit to a delta-connected configuration. In some cases, it may be the
other way around. It is often easier to analyse the circuit after such a transformation. This chapter firstly
explains how to recognize a delta and a star connection and then applies the delta—star and star—delta
transformations to d.c. and a.c. networks through calculations.

34.1 Introduction

By using Kirchhoff’s laws, mesh-current analysis, nodal
analysis or the superposition theorem, currents and volt-
ages in many networks can be determined as shown
in Chapters 30 to 32. Thévenin’s and Norton’s theo-
rems, introduced in Chapter 33, provide an alternative
method of solving networks and often with consider-
ably reduced numerical calculations. Also, these latter
theorems are especially useful when only the current
in a particular branch of a complicated network is
required. Delta—star and star—delta transformations may

be applied in certain types of circuit to simplify them
before application of circuit theorems.

34.2 Delta and star connections

The network shown in Figure 34. l(a) consisting of three
impedances Z,4, Zz and Zc is said to be x-connected.
This network can be redrawn as shown in Figure 34.1(b),
where the arrangement is referred to as delta-connected
or mesh-connected.

The network shown in Figure 34.2(a), consisting
of three impedances, Z,, Z2 and Z3, is said to be

T-connected. This network can be redrawn as shown in
Figure 34.2(b), where the arrangement is referred to as
star-connected.

34.3 Delta-star transformation

It is possible to replace the delta connection shown in
Figure 34.3(a) by an equivalent star connection as shown
in Figure 34.3(b), such that the impedance measured

Delta—star and star—delta transformations 483

Figure 34.3

between any pair of terminals (1—2, 2—3 or 3-1) is the
same in star as in delta. The equivalent star network
will consume the same power and operate at the same
power factor as the original delta network. A delta—
star transformation may alternatively be termed ‘z to
T transformation’.

Considering terminals 1 and 2 of Figure 34.3(a), the
equivalent impedance is given by the impedance Zz in
parallel with the series combination of Z,4 and Zc

Zp(Za+Zc)
Zpt+Zat+Zc

1.e.

In Figure 34.3(b), the equivalent impedance between
terminals 1 and 2 is Z; and Z> in series, i.e. Z; + Z2
Thus,

Hence we have three simultaneous equations to be
solved for Z;, Z> and Z3
Equation (1) — equation (2) gives:

Equation (3) + equation (4) gives:

It is noted that impedance Z, is given by the prod-
uct of the two impedances in delta joined to terminal
1 Ge. Z4 and Zp), divided by the sum of the three
impedances; impedance Z is given by the product
of the two impedances in delta joined to terminal 2
(i.e. Zp and Zc), divided by the sum of the three

impedances; and impedance Z3 is given by the prod-
uct of the two impedances in delta joined to terminal
3 (ie. Z4 and Zc), divided by the sum of the three

impedances.

From Figure 34.14, p.d. across AC, Vac = (11) (4)

Hence p.d. between C and D (ie. p.d. across

Thus the current in the 8& resistance is given by

Maximum power transfer
theorems and impedance
matching

Why it is important to understand: Maximum power transfer theorems and impedance matching

In electrical engineering, the maximum power transfer theorem states that to obtain maximum external
power from a source with a finite internal resistance, the resistance of the load must equal the resistance
of the source as viewed from its output terminals. Moritz von Jacobi published the maximum power
(transfer) theorem around 1840; it is also referred to as Jacobi’s law. A related concept is reflection-less
impedance matching. In radio, transmission lines, and other electronics, there is often a requirement
to match the source impedance (such as a transmitter) to the load impedance (such as an antenna) to
avoid reflections in the transmission line. In electronics, impedance matching is the practice of designing
the input impedance of an electrical load (or the output impedance of its corresponding signal source)
to maximize the power transfer or minimize reflections from the load. Matching a load to a source for
maximum power transfer is extremely important in microwaves, as well as all manner of lower frequency
applications such as stereo sound systems, electrical generating plants, solar cells and hybrid electric cars.
This chapter explains, with calculations, the maximum power transfer theorems and the importance of
impedance matching.

35.1 Maximum power transfer

theorems

As mentioned in Section 13.9 on page 184, the maxi-
mum power transfer theorem has applications in stereo
amplifier design, where it is necessary to maximize
power delivered to speakers, and in electric vehicle
design, where it is necessary to maximize power deliv-
ered to drive a motor.

A network that contains linear impedances and one
or more voltage or current sources can be reduced to
a Thévenin equivalent circuit, as shown in Chapter 33.
When a load is connected to the terminals of this equiv-
alent circuit, power is transferred from the source to the
load.

A Thévenin equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 35.1
with source internal impedance, z =(r +jx) Q and com-
plex load Z =(R+jX)Q

Figure 35.1

The maximum power transferred from the source to
the load depends on the following four conditions.

Condition 1. Let the load consist of a pure variable
resistance R (i.e. let X =O). Then current / in the load is
given by:

le E
~ (r+R)+ jx

E
VI + RY? +x7]
The active power P delivered to load R is given by

and the magnitude of current, |7| =

5 E?R
P=(|1|*R=————— >
(r +R)? 4+ x2
To determine the value of R for maximum power
transferred to the load, P is differentiated with respect
to R and then equated to zero (this being the normal
procedure for finding maximum or minimum values

using calculus). Using the quotient rule of differenti-
ation,

dP nf [(r +R)? +.x7](1) — (R)(2)(r + R)
dR [FRPP FR?P

= 0 for a maximum (or minimum) value.

dP
For aR to be zero, the numerator of the fraction must

be zero.

Hence (r+ R)* +x? —2R(r + R)=0

i.e. r? +2rR+ R* +x? —2Rr—2R* =0

from which, r* + x7 = R? (1)
or R=J/(r +x?) = [z|

Thus, with a variable purely resistive load, the maximum
power is delivered to the load if the load resistance R is
made equal to the magnitude of the source impedance.

Condition 2. Let both the load and the source impe-
dance be purely resistive (i.e. let x =X =0). From
equation (1) it may be seen that the maximum power is
transferred when R=r (this is, in fact, the d.c. condition
explained in Chapter 13, page 184)

Condition 3. Let the load Z have both variable resis-
tance R and variable reactance X. From Figure 35.1,

E

current J = - and
(r+R)+j7(~+X)

The active power P delivered to the load is given by
P ={1|?R (since power can only be dissipated in a resist-
ance) i.e.

Z E?R
~ (r +R)? +(x +x)?

If X is adjusted such that X = —x then the value of power
is a maximum.

Maximum power transfer theorems and impedance matching

(r+ R)*—2R(r +R)=0
i.e. r2+2rR+R2—2Rr —2R2=0

from which, r2—R?2=0and R=r

Thus with the load impedance Z consisting of vari-
able resistance R and variable reactance X, maximum
power is delivered to the load when X = —x and R =r
ie. when R+ jX =r — jx. Hence maximum power is
delivered to the load when the load impedance is the
complex conjugate of the source impedance.

Condition 4. Let the load impedance Z have variable
resistance R and fixed reactance X. From Figure 35.1,

from which, R? =r? +(x +X)? and

R= Jr +(¢+X)’)]

Summary
With reference to Figure 35.1:

1. When the load is purely resistive (i.e. X =0) and
adjustable, maximum power transfer is achieved
when

R=(z|=/(r? +x’)

2. When both the load and the source impedance are
purely resistive (i.e. X =x =0), maximum power
transfer is achieved when Rk =r

3. When the load resistance R and reactance X are
both independently adjustable, maximum power
transfer is achieved when

X=-xandR=r

4. When the load resistance R is adjustable with reac-
tance X fixed, maximum power transfer is achieved
when

R= Jr +(e+X)7]

The maximum power transfer theorems are primarily
important where a small source of power is involved —
such as, for example, the output from a telephone system
(see Section 35.2)

Problem 1. For the circuit shown in Figure 35.2
the load impedance Z is a pure resistance.
Determine (a) the value of R for maximum power
to be transferred from the source to the load and (b)
the value of the maximum power delivered to R.

Z = {16 + f20)0

(a) Fromcondition 1, maximum power transfer occurs
when R=|z|, i.c. when

R=|15+ j20| = /(15? +207) = 252

(b) Current J flowing in the load is given by
I=E/Zr, where the total circuit impedance
Zr =z+R=154 j20+25

Thus maximum power delivered,

Hence I[ = 2.683 2-26.57°A

Problem 2. If the load impedance Z in

Figure 35.2 of Problem 1 consists of variable
resistance R and variable reactance X, determine
(a) the value of Z that results in maximum power
transfer and (b) the value of the maximum power.

(a) Fromcondition 3, maximum power transfer occurs
when X =—x and R=r

Thus if z=r+ jx =(15+ j20)Q then
Z=(15—j20)2 or 252-53.13°2

(b) Total circuit impedance at maximum power trans-
fer condition, Z7 =z+ Z, i.e.

Zr = (15 + j20) + (15 — j20) = 30Q

Problem 3. For the network shown in

Figure 35.3, determine (a) the value of the load
resistance R required for maximum power transfer,
and (b) the value of the maximum power
transferred.

(a) This problem is an example of condition 1, where
maximum power transfer is achieved when R =|z|.

Thus the value of load resistance for maximum
power transfer is 84.67 Q (i.e. |z|)

(b) With z=(71.69—j45.04)Q and R=84.67Q

for maximum power transfer, the total circuit
impedance,
Zr =71.69 + 84.67 — j45.04

Problem 4. In the network shown in Figure 35.4
the load consists of a fixed capacitive reactance of
7Q. and a variable resistance R. Determine (a) the
value of R for which the power transferred to the
load is a maximum, and (b) the value of the

35.2 Impedance matching

It is seen from Section 35.1 that when it is nec-
essary to obtain the maximum possible amount of
power from a source, it is advantageous if the cir-
cuit components can be adjusted to give equality of
impedances. This adjustment is called ‘impedance
matching’ and is an important consideration in elec-
tronic and communications devices which normally
involve small amounts of power. Examples where
matching is important include coupling an aerial to a
transmitter or receiver, or coupling a loudspeaker to
an amplifier. Also, matching a load to a source for
maximum power transfer is extremely important in
microwaves, as well as all manner of lower frequency
applications such as electrical generating plants and
solar cells.

The mains power supply is considered as infinitely
large compared with the demand upon it, and under such
conditions it is unnecessary to consider the conditions
for maximum power transfer. With transmission lines
(see Chapter 44), the lines are ‘matched’ ideally, i.e.
terminated in their characteristic impedance.

With d.c. generators, motors or secondary cells, the
internal impedance is usually very small and in such
cases, if an attempt is made to make the load impedance
as small as the source internal impedance, overloading
of the source results.

A method of achieving maximum power transfer
between a source and a load is to adjust the value of the
load impedance to match the source impedance, which
can be done using a ‘matching-transformer’.

If the input impedance of Figure 35.19 is purely resistive
(say, r) and the load impedance is purely resistive (say,

N 2

(This is the case introduced in Section 20.10, page 293.)
Thus by varying the value of the transformer turns ratio,
the equivalent input impedance of the transformer can
be ‘matched’ to the impedance of a source to achieve
maximum power transfer.

Problem 7. Determine the optimum value of load
resistance for maximum power transfer if the load is
connected to an amplifier of output resistance 448 O

Complex waveforms

Alternating currents and voltages come in very many forms; for example, the electricity power supply,
sound, light, video, radio, all produce signals that alternate — meaning they change their values over time,
alternating above and below a particular value (often, but not always zero). Our bodies also produce
alternating electrical signals, as do all sorts of natural and man-made objects and devices. These signals
are what engineers and technicians are most often interested in when studying electronics, but signals
come in many very different forms. To understand complex signals, there is often a need to simplify
them; if the signal can be understood in its simplest form, then that understanding can be applied to the
complex signal. A complex wave is a wave made up of a series of sine waves; it is therefore more complex
than a single pure sine wave. This series of sine waves always contains a sine wave called the fundamental
which has the same frequency (repetition rate) as the complex wave being created. This chapter explains
harmonic synthesis, uses Fourier series for simple functions, calculates r.m.s., mean values and power
with complex waves, and lists and explains some sources of harmonics.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

e define a complex wave

e recognize periodic functions

36.1 Introduction

In preceding chapters a.c. supplies have been assumed
to be sinusoidal, this being a form of alternating quan-
tity commonly encountered in electrical engineering.
However, many supply waveforms are not sinusoidal.
For example, sawtooth generators produce ramp wave-
forms, and rectangular waveforms may be produced
by multivibrators. A waveform that is not sinusoidal is
called a complex wave. Such a waveform may be shown
to be composed of the sum of a series of sinusoidal waves
having various interrelated periodic times.

A function f (f) is said to be periodic if f(t + T)= f(t)
for all values of t, where T is the interval between two
successive repetitions and is called the period of the
function f(t). A sine wave having a period of 27/a is
a familiar example of a periodic function.

A typical complex periodic-voltage waveform,
shown in Figure 36.1, has period T seconds and
frequency f hertz. A complex wave such as this can be
resolved into the sum of a number of sinusoidal wave-
forms, and each of the sine waves can have a different
frequency, amplitude and phase.

The initial, major sine wave component has a fre-
quency f equal to the frequency of the complex wave
and this frequency is called the fundamental fre-
quency. The other sine wave components are known as
harmonics, these having frequencies which are integer
multiples of frequency f. Hence the second harmonic
has a frequency of 2f, the third harmonic has a fre-
quency of 3f, and so on. Thus if the fundamental (i.e.
supply) frequency of a complex wave is 50 Hz, then the
third harmonic frequency is 150 Hz, the fourth harmonic
frequency is 200 Hz, and so on.

36.2 The general equation

for a complex waveform

The instantaneous value of a complex voltage wave
v acting in a linear circuit may be represented by the
general equation

v = Vi Sin(@t + V1) + Vom sin(2@t + V2)
+--+ + Vim sin(nwt + V,,) volts (1)

Here Vj» sin(@t+‘¥;) represents the fundamental
component of which Vj, is the maximum or peak value,
frequency, f = @/2a and ‘Y; is the phase angle with
respect to time, t = 0.

Similarly, V2, sin(2@t + ‘Y2) represents the second
harmonic component, and V,,sin(nwt +'P,) repre-
sents the nth harmonic component, of which V,,, is the
peak value, frequency = nw/2a(=nf) and ¥,, is the
phase angle.

In the same way, the instantaneous value of a complex
current i may be represented by the general equation

i= Jj sin(@t + 01) + 12m sin(2wt + 02)
+-++ +I ym sin(not + 6,) amperes (2)

Where equations (1) and (2) refer to the voltage across
and the current flowing through a given linear circuit,
the phase angle between the fundamental voltage and
current is ¢; = (VY; — 91), the phase angle between the
second harmonic voltage and current is 2 = (‘V2 — 42),
and so on.

It often occurs that not all harmonic components are
present in a complex waveform. Sometimes only the
fundamental and odd harmonics are present, and in
others only the fundamental and even harmonics are
present.

The following worked problems help introduce
complex waveform equations and revise a.c. values from
Chapter 14.

Problem 1. A complex voltage wave is given by:

v =200sin 100zt + 80sin300zt +40 sin500zt volts

Determine (a) which harmonics are present, (b) the
r.m.s. value of the fundamental, (c) the frequency of
the fundamental, (d) the periodic time of the
fundamental, (e) the frequencies of the harmonics.

(a) The first term, or fundamental, 200 sin 100z tf, has
@ = 100z rad/s and maximum value 200 V. The

Complex waveforms 507

second term, 80 sin 300z ft, has an angular velocity
of 300z rad/s, which is three times that for the
fundamental.

Hence, 80 sin 300s is the third harmonic term.

Similarly, 40sin500¢ is the fifth harmonic

term.
(b) R.m.s. value of the fundamental = 0.707 x 200

Frequency of fifth harmonic = 5 x 50 = 250 Hz

Problem 2. A complex current wave is
represented by:

i =60sin240mt + 24sin (4807 _ “)

Determine (a) the frequency of the fundamental
(b) the percentage second harmonic, (c) the
percentage third harmonic, (d) the r.m.s. value of
the second harmonic, (e) the phase angles of the
harmonic components and (f) mean value of the
third harmonic.

Since 480 is twice 240, and 720 is three times 240, the
harmonics present in the given wave are the second
and third.

(a) Frequency of fundamental, f; = 5 ‘= 120 Hz

(b) Percentage second harmonic means expressing
the maximum value of the second harmonic as

damental,

i.e. percentage second harmonic = 60 x 100%

(c) Percentage third harmonic = 60 x 100% = 25%

(d) R.m.s. value of second harmonic = 0.707 x 24

(e) The second harmonic has a phase angle of - rad
lagging (or 45° lagging).
The third harmonic has a phase angle of . rad

(f) Mean or average value of third harmonic

and a frequency of 400Hz together with a

36.3 Harmonic synthesis

Harmonic analysis is the process of resolving a
complex periodic waveform into a series of sinusoidal
components of ascending order of frequency. Many of


508 — Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

the waveforms met in practice can be represented by
mathematical expressions similar to those of equations
(1) and (2), and the magnitude of their harmonic compo-
nents together with their phase may be calculated using
Fourier* series (see Section 36.4 and Section 36.5).
Numerical methods are used to analyse waveforms
for which simple mathematical expressions cannot be
obtained. A numerical method of harmonic analysis
is explained in Chapter 37. In a laboratory, waveform
analysis may be performed using a waveform analyser
which produces a direct readout of the component
waves present in a complex wave.

By adding the instantaneous values of the fundamen-
tal and progressive harmonics of a complex wave for
given instants in time, the shape of a complex waveform
can be gradually built up. This graphical procedure is
known as harmonic synthesis (synthesis meaning ‘the
putting together of parts or elements so as to make up
a complex whole’).

A number of examples of harmonic synthesis will
now be considered.

Example 1
Consider the complex voltage expression given by
vq = 100 sin wt + 30sin3et volts

The waveform is made up of a fundamental wave of
maximum value 100 V and frequency, f = w/2z hertz
and a third harmonic component of maximum value
30V and frequency = 3/22 (=3f), the fundamental
and third harmonics being initially in phase with each
other. Since the maximum value of the third harmonic is
30 V and that of the fundamental is 100 V, the resultant
waveform vg is said to contain 30/100, 1.e. ‘30% third
harmonic’. In Figure 36.2, the fundamental waveform
is shown by the broken line plotted over one cycle, the
periodic time being 27/a seconds. On the same axis is
plotted 30sin3at, shown by the dotted line, having a
maximum value of 30 V and for which three cycles are
completed in time T seconds. At zero time, 30 sin3at
is in phase with 100sin ort.

The fundamental and third harmonic are combined by
adding ordinates at intervals to produce the waveform
for vg as shown. For example, at time 7/12 seconds,
the fundamental has a value of 50 V and the third har-
monic a value of 30 V. Adding gives a value of 80 V for
waveform bg, at time 7/12 seconds. Similarly, at time
T/4 seconds, the fundamental has a value of 100 V and
the third harmonic a value of —30 V. After addition, the

resultant waveform v, is 70 V at time 7/4. The proce-
dure is continued between f = 0 and t = T to produce
the complex waveform for vg. The negative half-cycle
of waveform vg is seen to be identical in shape to the
positive half-cycle.

Example 2

Consider the addition of a fifth harmonic component to
the complex waveform of Figure 36.2, giving a resultant
waveform expression

vp = 100sinwt + 30sin3@t + 20sin 5@t volts

Figure 36.3 shows the effect of adding (100sin t+
30sin3e@t) obtained from Figure 36.2 to 20sin5et.
The shapes of the negative and positive half-cycles
are still identical. If further odd harmonics of the
appropriate amplitude and phase were added to bp»,
a good approximation to a square wave would
result.

Example 3

Consider the complex voltage expression given by
a
ve = 100sinwt + 30sin (Sor + >) volts

This expression is similar to voltage v, in that the peak
value of the fundamental and third harmonic are the
same. However, the third harmonic has a phase dis-
placement of z/2 radian leading (i.e. leading 30 sin3at
by z/2 radian). Note that, since the periodic time of the
fundamental is T seconds, the periodic time of the third
harmonic is 7/3 seconds, and a phase displacement of
/2 radian or i cycle of the third harmonic represents a
time interval of (7/3)~ 4, i.e. T/12 seconds.

Figure 36.4 shows graphs of 100sin@f and
30sin(3@t+2/2) over the time for one cycle of
the fundamental. When ordinates of the two graphs
are added at intervals, the resultant waveform v-
is as shown. The shape of the waveform ov, is
quite different from that of waveform vg shown in
Figure 36.2, even though the percentage third har-
monic is the same. If the negative half-cycle in
Figure 36.4 is reversed it can be seen that the
shape of the positive and negative half-cycles are
identical.

Example 4
Consider the complex voltage expression given by

vg = 100sin wt + 30sin (Ber - 4) volts

monic component, 30sin(3@t — 7/2), are plotted in

—30sin@Got + 2/2) is shown in Figure 36.7(b) where it
is seen to be in the opposite direction to that shown in

General conclusions on examples 1 to 6

Whenever odd harmonics are added to a fundamental
waveform, whether initially in phase with each other or
not, the positive and negative half-cycles of the resultant
complex wave are identical in shape (i.e. in Figures 36.2
to 36.6, the values of voltage in the third quadrant —
between 7/2 seconds and 37/4 seconds — are identical
to the voltage values in the first quadrant — between
0 and 7/4 seconds, except that they are negative, and
the values of voltage in the second and fourth quad-
rants are identical, except for the sign change. This is a
feature of waveforms containing a fundamental and odd

harmonics and is true whether harmonics are added or
subtracted from the fundamental.

From Figures 36.2 to 36.6, it is seen that a waveform
can change its shape considerably as a result of changes
in both phase and magnitude of the harmonics.

Example 7

Consider the complex current expression given by

ig = 10sinwt + 4sin2@t amperes

Current i, consists of a fundamental component,
10 sinwt, and a second harmonic component, 4 sin 21,
the components being initially in phase with each
other. Current i, contains 40% second harmonic. The
fundamental and second harmonic are shown plotted
separately in Figure 36.8. By adding ordinates at inter-
vals, the complex waveform representing ig is produced
as shown. It is noted that if all the values in the nega-
tive half-cycle were reversed then this half-cycle would
appear as a mirror image of the positive half-cycle about
a vertical line drawn through time tf = T/2

Example 8

Consider the complex current expression given by
ip = 10sinwt + 4sin2@t + 3sin4@t amperes

The waveforms representing (10sinwt + 4sin2@t) and
the fourth harmonic component, 3sin4@f, are each
shown separately in Figure 36.9, the former wave-
form having been produced in Figure 36.8. By adding
ordinates at intervals, the complex waveform for ip is
produced as shown in Figure 36.9. If the half-cycle

General conclusions on examples 7 to 10

Whenever even harmonics are added to a fundamental

component:

(a) if the harmonics are initially in phase or if there
is a phase shift of z rad, the negative half-cycle,
when reversed, is a mirror image of the positive
half-cycle about a vertical line drawn through time
t=T/2;

(b) if the harmonics are initially out of phase with
each other (i.e. other than z rad), the positive and
negative half-cycles are dissimilar.

These are features of waveforms containing the
fundamental and even harmonics.

Example 12

The fundamental, the second harmonic lagging by

radian are initially plotted separately, as shown in
Figure 36.13. Adding ordinates at intervals gives the
resultant waveform vy, as shown. The positive and
negative half-cycles are seen to be quite dissimilar.

General conclusions on examples 11 and 12
Whenever a waveform contains both odd and even
harmonics:

(a) if the harmonics are initially in phase with each
other, the negative cycle, when reversed, is a mirror
image of the positive half-cycle about a vertical line
drawn through time t = 7/2;

(b) ifthe harmonics are initially out of phase with each
other, the positive and negative half-cycles are
dissimilar.

and a second harmonic of amplitude 20mA, lag-

Periodic functions

As stated earlier in this chapter, a function f (x) is said
to be periodic if f(x +7) = f(x) for all values of
x, where T is some positive number. T is the inter-
val between two successive repetitions and is called the
period of the functions f(x).

For example, y = sin x is periodic in x with period 2z
since sinx = sin(x + 27) = sin(x + 47), and so on. In
general, if y = sina? then the period of the waveform
is 27/w. The function shown in Figure 36.18 is also
periodic of period 27 and is defined by:

—l, when —z <x <0
fO)= 1, when O<x<z

Ifa graph of a function has no sudden jumps or breaks
it is called a continuous function, examples being the
graphs of sine and cosine functions. However, other
graphs make finite jumps at a point or points in the inter-
val. The square wave shown in Figure 36.18 has finite
discontinuities at x = 2, 27, 37, and so on. A great
advantage of Fourier series over other series is that it
can be applied to functions which are discontinuous as
well as those which are continuous.

The basis of a Fourier series is that all functions of
practical significance which are defined in the interval
—m <x <z can be expressed in terms of a convergent
trigonometric series of the form:

f(x) =a0 +a, cosx + a2 c082x +a3c0s3x +---
+b, sinx + bo sin2x + b3sin3x+---

and by = = | Jf (x) sin nx dx (n = 1,2,3,...) (6)

ao, Gn and by are called the Fourier coefficients of
the series and if these can be determined, the series of
equation (3) is called the Fourier series corresponding
to f(x).

For the series of equation (3):

the term (a; cosx +b; sinx) or c,sin(x +@}) is
called the first harmonic or the fundamental, the
term (a2cos2x + bysin2x) or czsin(2x + a2) is
called the second harmonic, and so on.

For an exact representation of a complex wave, an
infinite number of terms are, in general, required. In
many practical cases, however, it is sufficient to take
the first few terms only. Obtaining a Fourier series for
a periodic function of period 27 is demonstrated in the
following worked problems.

Problem 5. Obtain a Fourier series for the
periodic function f(x) defined as:

Fa) =|

The function is periodic outside of this range with
period 27

Figure 36.19

The square wave function defined is shown in
Figure 36.19. Since f(x) is given by two different
expressions in the two halves of the range the integra-
tion is performed in two parts, one from —z to O and
the other from 0 to z

Problem 6. For the Fourier series of Problem 5,

the Fourier series, and

tial sum, and so on.

Graphs of Pj, P2 and P3, obtained by drawing up
tables of values, and adding waveforms, are shown in
Figures 36.20(a) to (c) and they show that the series
is convergent, i.e. continually approximating towards a
definite limit as more and more partial sums are taken,
and in the limit will have the sum f(x) =z

Even with just three partial sums, the waveform is
starting to approach the rectangular wave the Fourier
series is representing.

Expansion of non-periodic functions

If a function f(x) is not periodic then it cannot be
expanded in a Fourier series for all values of x. However,
it is possible to determine a Fourier series to represent
the function over any range of width 27

Given a non-periodic function, a new function may
be constructed by taking the values of f(x) in the
given range and then repeating them outside of the
given range at intervals of 27. Since this new func-
tion is, by construction, periodic with period 27, it
may then be expanded in a Fourier series for all

\ a2
~7'S4/3 sin 3x

© 4/5 sin 5x

(c)
Figure 36.20

values of x. For example, the function f(x) = x is
not a periodic function. However, if a Fourier series
for f(x) =x is required then the function is con-
structed outside of this range so that it is periodic
with period 2x as shown by the broken lines in
Figure 36.21.

For non-periodic functions, such as f(x) =x, the sum
of the Fourier series is equal to f (x) at all points in the
given range but it is not equal to f(x) at points outside
of the range.

For determining a Fourier series of a non-periodic
function over a range 27, exactly the same formulae

Problem 7. Determine the Fourier series to

The function f(x) = 2x is not periodic. The function
is shown in the range —z to z in Figure 36.22 and is then
constructed outside of that range so that it is periodic of
period 27 (see broken lines) with the resulting saw-tooth
waveform.

36.6 R.m.s. value, mean value and the

form factor of a complex wave

R.m.s. value

Let the instantaneous value of a complex current, i, be
given by

i = Im sin(ot + 461) + lam sin2et + 62)
+--++Inm sin(not + 6,) amperes
The effective or r.m.s. value of this current is given by

Without writing down all terms involved when squaring
current i, it can be seen that two types of term result,
these being:

(i) terms suchas I? sin? (wt +61), &,, sin?(2@t +02),
and so on, and

(ii) terms such as 21); Jo sin(@t + 91) sin(2@t + 42),
i.e. products of different harmonics.

The mean value of i? is the sum of the mean values of
each term in equation (16).

From equations (18) to (21) it is seen that the rm.s.
value of a complex wave is unaffected by the relative
phase angles of the harmonic components. For a d.c.
current or voltage, the instantaneous value, the mean
value and the maximum value are equal. Thus, if a

Similarly, the average power supplied over one cycle

36.8 Harmonics in single-phase

circuits

When a complex alternating voltage wave, i.e. one con-
taining harmonics, is applied to a single-phase circuit
containing resistance, inductance and/or capacitance
(i.e. linear circuit elements), then the resulting current
will also be complex and contain harmonics.

Let a complex voltage v be represented by

v = Vim Sin ot + V2 Sin 2ot + V3nsin3@t +---

Complex waveforms 529

(a) Pure resistance

The impedance of a pure resistance R is independent of
frequency and the current and voltage are in phase for
each harmonic. Thus the general expression for current
i is given by

i=2= Vim sin ot + Vom sin Dot

V3m
—— sin3@t+---
+ +

The percentage harmonic content in the current wave
is the same as that in the voltage wave. For exam-
ple, the percentage second harmonic content from
equation (31) is

R
VamiR 100%, i.e. 12" x 100%
Vim/R Vim

the same as for the voltage wave. The current and
voltage waveforms will therefore be identical in shape.

(b) Pure inductance

The impedance of a pure inductance L, i.e. inductive
reactance X;,(=27/fL), varies with the harmonic fre-
quency when voltage v is applied to it. Also, for every
harmonic term, the current will lag the voltage by 90°
or z/2 rad. The current i is given by

v Vim

. . x4 Vom. a
t= y= sin (ot — >) + 54 sin (20% — 5)

Van. U
+ 30L sin (304 — 5) +-::-
(32)

since for the nth harmonic the reactance is nwL.
Equation (32) shows that for, say, the nth harmonic, the
percentage harmonic content in the current waveform is
only 1I/n of the corresponding harmonic content in the
voltage waveform.

If a complex current contains a d.c. component then the
direct voltage drop across a pure inductance is zero.

(c) Pure capacitance

The impedance of a pure capacitance C, i.e. capacitive
reactance Xc(=1/(27fC)), varies with the harmonic
frequency when voltage v is applied to it. Also, for each
harmonic term the current will lead the voltage by 90°
or z/2rad. The current i is given by

Hence current,

+V3m (3oC) sin (30r + =) poe
(33)

Equation (33) shows that the percentage harmonic con-
tent of the current waveform is n times larger for the
nth harmonic than that of the corresponding harmonic
voltage.

If a complex current contains a d.c. component then
none of this direct current will flow through a pure
capacitor, although the alternating components of the
supply still operate.

is applied to a circuit comprising a resistance of

14.04° = 14.04 x (2/180) rad =0.245 rad,

thus
Tim = 19.40Z—0.245A

Hence the fundamental current
iy = 19.40 sin(314t —0.245)A

(Note that with an expression of the form

be expressed in radians.)

36.10 Resonance due to harmonics

In industrial circuits at power frequencies the typical
values of L and C involved make resonance at the fun-
damental frequency very unlikely. (An exception to this
is with the capacitor-start induction motor where the
start-winding can achieve unity power factor during
run-up.)

However, if the voltage waveform is not a pure sine
wave it is quite possible for the resonant frequency to be
near the frequency of one of the harmonics. In this case
the magnitude of the particular harmonic in the current
waveform is greatly increased and may even exceed that
of the fundamental. The effect of this is a great distortion
of the resultant current waveform so that dangerous volt
drops may occur across the inductance and capacitance
in the circuit.

When a circuit resonates at one of the harmonic fre-
quencies of the supply voltage, the effect is called selec-
tive or harmonic resonance.

For resonance with the fundamental, the condition is
aL = 1/(@C); for resonance at, say, the third harmonic,
the condition is 3aL = 1/(3@C); for resonance at the
nth harmonic, the condition is

noL = 1/(nwC)

fundamental of maximum value 400 V and a third
harmonic of maximum value 10 V is applied to the

36.11 Sources of harmonics

(i)

(ii)

Harmonics may be produced in the output wave-
form of an a.c. generator. This may be due
either to ‘tooth-ripple’, caused by the effect of
the slots that accommodate the windings, or to
the non-sinusoidal airgap flux distribution.

Great care is taken to ensure a sinusoidal output
from generators in large supply systems; however,
non-linear loads will cause harmonics to appear
in the load current waveform. Thus harmonics
are produced in devices that have a non-linear
response to their inputs. Non-linear circuit ele-
ments (i.e. those in which the current flowing
through them is not proportional to the applied
voltage) include rectifiers and any large-signal
electronic amplifier in which diodes, transistors,
valves or iron-cored inductors are used.

A rectifier is a device for converting an alternat-
ing or an oscillating current into a unidirectional
or approximate direct current. A rectifier has a
low impedance to current flow in one direction
and a nearly infinite impedance to current flow

Time {s;

(av)

in the opposite direction. Thus, when an alternat-
ing current is applied to a rectifier, current will
flow through it during the positive half-cycles
only; the current is zero during the negative half-
cycles. A typical current waveform is shown in
Figure 36.31. This ‘half-wave rectification’ is pro-
duced by using a single diode. The waveform is
similar in shape to that shown in Figure 36.14,
page 512, where the d.c. component brought the
negative half-cycle up to the zero current point.
The waveform shown in Figure 36.31 is typical
of one containing a fairly large second harmonic.

Transistors and valves are non-linear devices
in that sinusoidal input results in different posi-
tive and negative half-cycle amplifications. This
means that the output half cycles have dif-
ferent amplitudes. Since they have a different
shape, even harmonic distortion is suggested (see
Section 36.3).

Ferromagnetic-cored coils are a source of har-
monic generation in a.c. circuits because of the
non-linearity of the B/H curve and the hystere-
sis loop, especially if saturation occurs. Let a
sinusoidal voltage v = V,, sin@wt be applied to a
ferromagnetic-cored coil (having low resistance
relative to inductive reactance) of cross-section
area A square metres and possessing N turns.
If ¢ is the flux produced in the core then the
instantaneous voltage is given by v=N(d¢/d?r).
If B is the flux density of the core, then, since
® = BA,

v= N 7 (BA) =NA di

Equation (34) shows that if the applied voltage
is sinusoidal, the flux density B in the iron core
must also be sinusoidal but lagging by 90°.
The condition of low resistance relative to induc-
tive reactance, giving a sinusoidal flux from a
sinusoidal supply voltage, is called free magne-
tization.
Consider the application of a sinusoidal voltage
to a coil wound on a core with a hysteresis loop,
as shown in Figure 36.32(a). The horizontal axis
of a hysteresis loop is magnetic field strength
H, but since H = Ni/l and N and / (the length
of the flux path) are constant, the axis may
be directly scaled as current i (i.e. i = HI/N).
Figure 36.32(b) shows sinusoidal voltage v and
flux density B waveforms, B lagging v by 90°.
The current waveform is shown in Figure
36.32(c) and is derived as follows. At time 11,
point a on the voltage curve corresponds to point

Complex waveforms 539

(v)

b on the flux density curve and point c on the
hysteresis loop. The current at time f; is given by
the distance dc. Plotting this current on a vertical
time-scale gives the derived point e on the current
curve. A similar procedure is adopted for times
t2, 13 and so on over one cycle of the voltage.

(Note that it is important to move around
the hysteresis loop in the correct direction.) It
is seen from the current curve that it is non-
sinusoidal and that the positive and negative
half-cycles are identical. This indicates that the
waveform contains only odd harmonics (see
Section 36.3).

If, in a circuit containing a ferromagnetic-cored
coil, the resistance is high compared with the
inductive reactance, then the current flowing from
a sinusoidal supply will tend to be sinusoidal.
This means that the flux density B of the core
cannot be sinusoidal since it is related to the cur-
rent by the hysteresis loop. This means, in turn,
that the induced voltage due to the alternating
flux (i.e. vo = NA(dB/dt)) will not be sinusoidal.
This condition is called forced magnetization.

The shape of the induced voltage waveform
under forced magnetization is obtained as fol-
lows. The current waveform is shown on a
vertical axis in Figure 36.33(a). The hysteresis
loop corresponding to the maximum value of cir-
cuit current is drawn as shown in Figure 36.33(b).
The flux density curve which is derived from
the sinusoidal current waveform is shown in
Figure 36.33(c). Point a on the current wave at
time t; corresponds to point b on the hysteresis
loop and to point c on the flux density curve. By
taking other points throughout the current cycle
the flux density curve is derived as shown.

The relationship between the induced voltage v
and the flux density B is given by v = NA(dBAdr).
Here dB/dt represents the rate of change of flux
density with respect to time, i.e. the gradient of the
Bit curve. At point d the gradient of the B/t curve
is a maximum in the positive direction. Thus o
will be maximum positive as shown by point d’
in Figure 36.33(d). At point e the gradient (i.e.
dB/dt) is zero, thus v is zero, as shown by pointe’.

At point f the gradient is maximum in a negative

by point f’. If all such points are taken around the
Bit curve, the curve representing induced volt-
age, shown in Figure 36.33(d), is produced. The
resulting voltage waveform is non-sinusoidal.
The positive and negative half cycles are iden-
tical in shape, indicating that the waveform
contains a fundamental and a prominent third
harmonic.

The amount of power delivered to a load can
be controlled using a thyristor, which is a
semiconductor device. Examples of applications
of controlled rectification include lamp and heater
controls and the control of motor speeds. A basic
circuit used for single-phase power control is
shown in Figure 36.34(a). The trigger module
contains circuitry to produce the necessary gate
current to turn the thyristor on. If the pulse is
applied at time @/w, where @ is the firing or
triggering angle, then the current flowing in
the load resistor has a waveform as shown in

on inspection.

Why it is important to understand: Harmonic analysis

Harmonic analysis is a branch of mathematics concerned with the representation of functions or signals
as the superposition of basic waves, and the study of and generalization of the notions of Fourier series
and Fourier transforms. In the past two centuries, it has become a vast subject with applications in areas
as diverse as signal processing, quantum mechanics and neuroscience. This chapter explains a tabular
method of harmonic analysis and explains how to predict the probable harmonic content of a waveform

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

e use a tabular method to determine the Fourier series for a complex waveform

e predict the probable harmonic content of a waveform on inspection

37.1 Introduction

Many practical waveforms can be represented by simple
mathematical expressions, and, by using Fourier series,
the magnitude of their harmonic components deter-
mined. For waveforms not in this category, analysis may
be achieved by numerical methods. Harmonic analy-
sis is the process of resolving a periodic, non-sinusoidal
quantity into a series of sinusoidal components of
ascending order of frequency.

form:

However, irregular waveforms are not usually defined
by mathematical expressions and thus the Fourier coef-
ficients cannot be determined by using calculus. In these
cases, approximate methods, such as the trapezoidal
rule, can be used to evaluate the Fourier coefficients.

Most practical waveforms to be analysed are periodic.
Let the period of a waveform be 27 and be divided into
p equal parts as shown in Figure 37.1. The width of
each interval is thus 27/p. Let the ordinates be labelled

different moments in a cycle are given by:

v (volts) 62 35 —38 —64 -63 —52

v (volts) —28 24 80 96 90 70

Draw the graph of voltage v against angle 6 and
analyse the voltage into its first three constituent
harmonics, each coefficient correct to 2 decimal
places.

The graph of voltage v against angle 0 is shown in
Figure 37.2. The range 0 to 2a is divided into 12
equal intervals giving an interval width of 27/12, i.e. 2/6
or 30°. The values of the ordinates y,, y2, y3,... are
62, 35, —38, ... from the given table of values. If a
larger number of intervals are used, results having a
greater accuracy are achieved. The data is tabulated in
the proforma shown in Table 37.1.

It is sometimes possible to predict the harmonic con-

characteristics.

(i) Ifaperiodic waveform is such that the area above
the horizontal axis is equal to the area below
then the mean value is zero. Hence ag =O (see
Figure 37.3(a)).

(iii) An odd function is symmetrical about the
origin and contains no cosine terms (see

(iv) f(x)=f(«+z) represents a waveform which
repeats after half a cycle and only even harmon-
ics are present (see Figure 37.3(d)).

(v) f(x)=—f(«+z) represents a waveform for
which the positive and negative cycles are identi-
cal in shape and only odd harmonics are present
(see Figure 37.3(e)).

(a) The waveform shown in Figure 37.4(a) is sym-

Also, the waveform has the characteristic
f(x) =—f(@+7), ie. the positive and negative
half-cycles are identical in shape. Only odd har-
monics can be present in such a waveform. Thus
the waveform shown in Figure 37.4(a) contains
only odd sine terms. Since the area above the
x-axis is equal to the area below, ap =0

(b) The waveform shown in Figure 37.4(b) is symmet-
rical about the f(x) axis and is thus an even

terms. Also, the waveform has the characteristic
f(x)=f(«+7), ie. the waveform repeats itself
after half a cycle. Only even harmonics can be
present in such a waveform. Thus the waveform

Magnetic materials

Why it is important to understand: Magnetic materials

Magnetism, the phenomenon by which materials assert an attractive or repulsive force or influence
on other materials, has been known for thousands of years. However, the underlying principles and
mechanisms that explain the magnetic phenomenon are complex and subtle, and their understanding has
eluded scientists until relatively recent times. Many of our modern technological devices rely on magnetism
and magnetic materials; these include electrical power generators and transformers, electric motors,
radio, television, telephones, computers and components of sound and video reproduction systems. Iron,
some steels and the naturally occurring mineral lodestone are well-known examples of materials that
exhibit magnetic properties. Not so familiar, however, is the fact that all substances are influenced to one
degree or another by the presence of a magnetic field. Permanent magnet materials are incorporated in
a device for only one reason, to increase magnetic flux. The flux may be necessary for detection, as it is in
sensors, to assist in creating a force or torque, as it does in motors, actuators and speakers, to generate a
voltage as it does in generators and alternators, to create a magnetic field as it does in Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) systems and electron beam devices. This chapter provides a brief description of terms
associated with magnetic fields and briefly looks at the phenomena of diamagnetism, paramagnetism and
ferromagnetism, explains hysteresis and eddy current losses and distinguishes between non-permanent
and permanent magnetic materials.

A magnetic field is the state of the space in
the vicinity of a permanent magnet or an elec-
tric current throughout which the magnetic forces
produced by the magnet or current are discernible.

Magnetic flux ® is the amount of magnetic field
produced by a magnetic source. The unit of mag-
netic flux is the weber,“ Wb. If the flux linking
one turn in a circuit changes by one weber in one
second, a voltage of one volt will be induced in
that turn.

Magnetic flux density B is the amount of flux
passing through a defined area that is perpendicular
to the direction of the flux.

Magnetomotive force (mmf) is the cause of
the existence of a magnetic flux in a magnetic
circuit.

mmf, F,, = NI amperes

where JN is the number of conductors (or turns)
and J is the current in amperes. The unit of mmf is
sometimes expressed as ‘ampere-turns’. However,
since ‘turns’ have no dimension, the S.I. unit of
mmf is the ampere.

Magnetic field strength (or magnetizing force),
H =NI/I ampere per metre

where / is the mean length of the flux path in
metres.

Thus mmf=N/J =H! amperes
Ho is a constant called the permeability of free

space (or the magnetic space constant). The value
of wo is 4a x 10-7 H/m.

38.2 Magnetic properties of materials

The full theory of magnetism is one of the most complex
of subjects. However, the phenomenon may be satisfac-
torily explained by the use of a simple model. Bohr

Magnetic materials 551

and Rutherford, who discovered atomic structure, sug-
gested that electrons move around the nucleus confined
to a plane, like planets around the sun. An even better
model is to consider each electron as having a surface,
which may be spherical or elliptical or something more
complicated.

Magnetic effects in materials are due to the elec-
trons contained in them, the electrons giving rise to
magnetism in the following two ways:

(i) _ by revolving around the nucleus

(ii) by their angular momentum about their own axis,
called spin.

In each of these cases the charge of the electron can
be thought of as moving round in a closed loop and
therefore acting as a current loop.

The main measurable quantity of an atomic model is
the magnetic moment. When applied to a loop of wire
carrying a current,

magnetic moment = current x area of the loop

Electrons associated with atoms possess magnetic
moment which gives rise to their magnetic properties.

Diamagnetism is a phenomenon exhibited by mater-
ials having a relative permeability less than unity. When
electrons move more or less in a spherical orbit around
the nucleus, the magnetic moment due to this orbital
is zero, all the current due to moving electrons being
considered as averaging to zero. If the net magnetic
moment of the electron spins were also zero then there
would be no tendency for the electron motion to line
up in the presence of a magnetic field. However, as a
field is being turned on, the flux through the electron
orbitals increases. Thus, considering the orbital as a cir-
cuit, there will be, by Faraday’s laws, an e.m.f. induced
in it which will change the current in the circuit. The
flux change will accelerate the electrons in its orbit,
causing an induced magnetic moment. By Lenz’s law
the flux due to the induced magnetic moment will be
such as to oppose the applied flux. As a result, the net
flux through the material becomes less than in a vacuum.
Since relative permeability is defined as

flux density in material

flux density in vacuum

with diamagnetic materials the relative permeability
is less than one.

Paramagnetism is a phenomenon exhibited by mate-
rials where the relative permeability is greater than unity.
Paramagnetism occurs in substances where atoms have

a permanent magnetic moment. This may be caused by
the orbitals not being spherical or by the spin of the
electrons. Electron spins tend to pair up and cancel each
other. However, there are many atoms with odd numbers
of electrons, or in which pairing is incomplete. Such
atoms have what is called a permanent dipole moment.
When a field is applied to them they tend to line up with
the field, like compass needles, and so strengthen the
flux in that region. (Diamagnetic materials do not tend
to line up with the field in this way.) When this effect is
stronger than the diamagnetic effect, the overall effect is
to make the relative permeability greater than one. Such
materials are called paramagnetic.

Ferromagnetic materials

Ferromagnetism is the phenomenon exhibited by mater-
ials having a relative permeability which is considerably
greater than | and which varies with flux density. Iron,
cobalt and nickel are the only elements that are ferro-
magnetic at ordinary working temperatures, but there
are several alloys containing one or more of these met-
als as constituents, with widely varying ferromagnetic
properties.

Consider the simple model of a single iron atom rep-
resented in Figure 38.1. It consists of a small, heavy
central nucleus surrounded by a total of 26 electrons.
Each electron has an orbital motion about the nucleus in
a limited region, or shell, such shells being represented
by circles K, L, M and N. The numbers in Figure 38.1
represent the number of electrons in each shell.

The outer shell N contains two loosely held electrons,
these electrons becoming the carriers of electric current,
making iron electrically conductive. There are 14 elec-
trons in the M shell and itis this group that is responsible
for magnetism. An electron carries a negative charge
and a charge in motion constitutes an electric current
with which is associated a magnetic field. Magnetism
would therefore result from the orbital motion of each
electron in the atom. However, experimental evidence
indicates that the resultant magnetic effect due to all the

Nucleus ~~

Figure 38.1 Single iron atom


552 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

orbital motions in the metal solid is zero; thus the orbital
currents may be disregarded.

In addition to the orbital motion, each electron spins
on its own axis. A rotating charge is equivalent to a cir-
cular current and gives rise to a magnetic field. In any
atom, all the axes about which the electrons spin are par-
allel, but rotation may be in either direction. In the single
atom shown in Figure 38.1, in each of the K, L and N
shells equal numbers of electrons spin in the clockwise
and anticlockwise directions respectively, and therefore
these shells are magnetically neutral. However, in shell
M, nine of the electrons spin in one direction while
five spin in the opposite direction. There is therefore a
resultant effect due to four electrons.

The atom of cobalt has 15 electrons in the M shell,
nine spinning in one direction and six in the other. Thus
with cobalt there is a resultant effect due to 3 electrons.
A nickel atom has a resultant effect due to 2 electrons.
The atoms of the paramagnetic elements, such as man-
ganese, chromium or aluminium, also have a resultant
effect for the same reasons as that of iron, cobalt and
nickel. However, in the diamagnetic materials there is an
exact equality between the clockwise and anticlockwise
spins.

The total magnetic field of the resultant effect due to
the four electrons in the iron atom is large enough to
influence other atoms. Thus the orientation of one atom
tends to spread through the material, with atoms acting
together in groups instead of behaving independently.
These groups of atoms, called domains (which tend
to remain permanently magnetized), act as units. Thus,
when a field is applied to a piece of iron, these domains
as a whole tend to line up and large flux densities can be
produced. This means that the relative permeability of
such materials is much greater than one. As the applied
field is increased, more and more domains align and the
induced flux increases.

The overall magnetic properties of iron alloys and
materials containing iron, such as ferrite (ferrite is a
mixture of iron oxide together with other oxides —
lodestone is a ferrite), depend upon the structure and
composition of the material. However, the presence of
iron ensures marked magnetic properties of some kind
in them. Ferromagnetic effects decrease with temper-
ature, as do those due to paramagnetism. The loss of
ferromagnetism with temperature is more sudden, how-
ever; the temperature at which it has all disappeared
is called the Curie* temperature. The ferromagnetic
properties reappear on cooling, but any magnetism will

*Who was Curie? Go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

have disappeared. Thus a permanent magnet will be
demagnetized by heating above the Curie temperature
(1040 K for iron) but can be remagnetized after cooling.
Above the Curie temperature, ferromagnetics behave as
paramagnetics.

38.3 Hysteresis and hysteresis loss

Hysteresis loop

Let a ferromagnetic material which is completely
demagnetized, i.e. one in which B= H =0 (either by
heating the sample above its Curie temperature or by
reversing the magnetizing current a large number of
times while at the same time, gradually reducing the
current to zero) be subjected to increasing values of
magnetic field strength H and the corresponding flux
density B measured. The domains begin to align and
the resulting relationship between B and H is shown by
the curve Oab in Figure 38.2. At a particular value of
H, shown as Oy, most of the domains will be aligned
and it becomes difficult to increase the flux density any
further. The material is said to be saturated. Thus by is
the saturation flux density.

Figure 38.2

If the value of H is now reduced it is found that the
flux density follows curve bc, i.e. the domains will tend
to stay aligned even when the field is removed. When
His reduced to zero, flux remains in the iron. This
remanent flux density or remanence is shown as 0c
in Figure 38.2. When 4H is increased in the opposite
direction, the domains begin to realign in the opposite
direction and the flux density decreases until, at a value
shown as Od, the flux density has been reduced to zero.
The magnetic field strength 0d required to remove the
residual magnetism, i.e. reduce B to zero, is called the
coercive force.

Magnetic materials 553

Further increase of H in the reverse direction causes
the flux density to increase in the reverse direction until
saturation is reached, as shown by curve de. If the
reversed magnetic field strength Ox is adjusted to the
same value of Oy in the initial direction, then the final
flux density xe is the same as yb. If AH is varied back-
wards from Ox to Oy, the flux density follows the curve
efgb, similar to curve bcde.

It is seen from Figure 38.2 that the flux density
changes lag behind the changes in the magnetic field
strength. This effect is called hysteresis. The closed
figure bcdefgb is called the hysteresis loop (or the B/H
loop).

Hysteresis loss

A disturbance in the alignment of the domains of a fer-
romagnetic material causes energy to be expended in
taking it through a cycle of magnetization. This energy
appears as heat in the specimen and is called the hyster-
esis loss. Let the hysteresis loop shown in Figure 38.3
be that obtained for an iron ring of mean circumference
1 and cross-sectional area a m? and let the number of
turns on the magnetizing coil be N.

Figure 38.3

Let the increase of flux density be dB when the mag-
netic field strength H is increased by a very small
amount km (see Figure 38.3) in time dt seconds, and
let the current corresponding to Ok be i amperes. Thus
since H =NI/I then 0k = Ni/l, from which,

Hence the energy supplied to the magnetic field when
H is increased from zero to Oy =(area fgbzf) J/m?.

Similarly, the energy returned from the magnetic field
when # is reduced from Oy to zero = (area bzcb) J/m?.

Hence net energy absorbed by the magnetic field
=(area febcf) J/m?.

Thus the hysteresis loss for a complete cycle
= area of loop efgbcde J/m?

If the hysteresis loop is plotted to a scale of
lcm=aampere/metre along the horizontal axis and
lcm= f tesla along the vertical axis, and if A represents
the area of the loop in square centimetres, then

hysteresis loss/cycle = Aw joules per metre® (2)

If hysteresis loops for a given ferromagnetic material
are determined for different maximum values of H,
they are found to lie within one another as shown in
Figure 38.4.

The maximum-sized hysteresis loop for a particular
material is obtained at saturation. If, for example, the
maximum flux density is reduced to half its value at
saturation, the area of the resulting loop is consider-
ably less than half the area of the loop at saturation.
From the areas of a number of such hysteresis loops, as
shown in Figure 38.4, the hysteresis loss per cycle was
found by Steinmetz (an American electrical engineer) to


554 — Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

be proportional to (B,)”, where n is called the Stein-
metz* index and can have a value between about 1.6
and 3.0, depending on the quality of the ferromagnetic
material and the range of flux density over which the
measurements are made.

From the above it is found that the hysteresis loss is
proportional to the volume of the specimen and the num-
ber of cycles through which the magnetization is taken.
Thus

hysteresis loss, P , = ky,uf(B,,)" watts (3)

where »v =volume in cubic metres, f = frequency in
hertz and ky is aconstant for a given specimen and given
range of B.

The magnitude of the hysteresis loss depends on the
composition of the specimen and on the heat treatment
and mechanical handling to which the specimen has
been subjected.

Figure 38.5 shows typical hysteresis loops for (a) hard
steel, which has a high remanence Oc and a large coer-
civity Od, (b) soft steel, which has a large remanence and
small coercivity and (c) ferrite, this being a ceramic-like
magnetic substance made from oxides of iron, nickel,
cobalt, magnesium, aluminium and manganese. The
hysteresis of ferrite is very small.

38.4 Eddy current loss

If a coil is wound on a ferromagnetic core (such as in
a transformer) and alternating current is passed through
the coil, an alternating flux is set up in the core. The
alternating flux induces an e.m.f. e in the coil given
by e=N(d¢/dt). However, in addition to the desirable
effect of inducing an e.m.f. in the coil, the alternating
flux induces undesirable voltages in the iron core. These
induced e.m.f.s set up circulating currents in the core,
known as eddy currents. Since the core possesses resis-
tance, the eddy currents heat the core, and this represents
wasted energy.

Eddy currents can be reduced by laminating the core,
i.e. splitting it into thin sheets with very thin layers
of insulating material inserted between each pair of
the laminations (this may be achieved by simply var-
nishing one side of the lamination or by placing paper
between each lamination). The insulation presents a
high resistance and this reduces any induced circulating
currents.

The eddy current loss may be determined as follows.
Let Figure 38.6 represent one strip of the core, having
a thickness of t metres, and consider just a rectangular
prism of the strip having dimensions f m x 1m x | mas
shown. The area of the front face ABCD is (t x 1) m2
and, since the flux enters this face at right-angles, the

Figure 38.6

eddy currents will flow along paths parallel to the long
sides.

Consider two such current paths each of width dx
and distance x m from the centre line of the front face.
The area of the rectangle enclosed by the two paths,
A=(2x)(1) =2x m?. Hence the maximum flux entering
the rectangle,

Din = (Bm)(A) = (Bm) (2x) weber (4)

Induced e.m.f. eis given by e=N(d¢/dr). Since the flux

From equation (9) it is seen that eddy current loss is pro-
portional to the square of the thickness of the core strip.
It is therefore desirable to make lamination strips as thin
as possible. However, at high frequencies where it is not
practicable to make very thin laminations, core losses
may be reduced by using ferrite cores or dust cores.
Ferrite is a ceramic material having magnetic properties
similar to silicon steel, and dust cores consist of fine
particles of carbonyl iron or permalloy (i.e. nickel and
iron), each particle of which is insulated from its neigh-
bour by a binding material. Such materials have a very
high value of resistivity.

Problem 5. The eddy current loss in a particular
magnetic circuit is 10 W/m’. If the frequency of
operation is reduced from 50 Hz to 30 Hz with the
flux density remaining unchanged, determine the

the core laminations have a thickness of 0.50 mm.
The core is redesigned so as to operate with the
same eddy current loss but at a different voltage and
at a frequency of 250 Hz. Assuming that at the new
voltage the maximum flux density is one-third of its
original value and the resistivity of the core remains
unaltered, determine the necessary new thickness of
the laminations.

unchanged in each case.

(a) From equation (3), hysteresis loss,

(b) The hysteresis loss, Ph =knvf (Bm)”, is indepen-
dent of the thickness of the laminations. Thus,

if the thickness of the laminations is halved, the
hysteresis loss remains at 40 W

2. A transformer core operating at 50Hz has
an eddy current loss of 150W/m? and the
core laminations are 0.4mm thick. The core

is redesigned so as to operate with the same

and at 200Hz frequency. Assuming that at
the new voltage the flux density is half of its
original value and the resistivity of the core
remains unchanged, determine the necessary
new thickness of the laminations.

An inductor core has an eddy current loss
of 25 W and a hysteresis loss of 35 W when
operating at 50 Hz frequency. Assuming that

The above method of separation of losses is an
approximate one since the Steinmetz index n is not a
constant value but tends to increase with increase of fre-
quency. However, a reasonable indication of the relative
magnitudes of the hysteresis and eddy current losses in
an iron core may be determined.

38.6 Non-permanent magnetic

materials

General

Nonpermanent magnetic materials are those in which
magnetism may be induced. With the magnetic circuits
of electrical machines, transformers and heavy current
apparatus a high value of flux density B is desirable
so as to limit the cross-sectional area A (® = BA) and
therefore the weight and cost involved. At the same time
the magnetic field strength H (= N/I/I) should be as small
as possible so as to limit the /7R losses in the exciting
coils. The relative permeability (uw; = B/(0H )) and the
saturation flux density should therefore be high. Also,
when flux is continually varying, as in transformers,
inductors and armature cores, low hysteresis and eddy
current losses are essential.

Silicon-iron alloys

In the earliest electrical machines the magnetic circuit
material used was iron with low content of carbon and
other impurities. However, it was later discovered that
the deliberate addition of silicon to the iron brought
about a great improvement in magnetic properties. The
laminations now used in electrical machines and in
transformers at supply frequencies are made of silicon-
steel in which the silicon in different grades of the
material varies in amounts from about 0.5% to 4.5% by
weight. The silicon added to iron increases the resistiv-
ity. This in turn increases the resistance (R = pl/A) and
thus helps to reduce eddy current loss. The hysteresis
loss is also reduced; however, the silicon reduces the
saturation flux density.

A limit to the amount of silicon which may be added
in practice is set by the mechanical properties of the

material, since the addition of silicon causes a material
to become brittle. Also, the brittleness of a silicon—iron
alloy depends on temperature. About 4.5% silicon is
found to be the upper practical limit for silicon—iron
sheets. Lohys is a typical example of a silicon-iron alloy
and is used for the armatures of d.c. machines and for
the rotors and stators of a.c. machines. Stalloy, which
has a higher proportion of silicon and lower losses, is
used for transformer cores.

Silicon steel sheets are often produced by a hot-
rolling process. In these finished materials the con-
stituent crystals are not arranged in any particular
manner with respect, for example, to the direction of
rolling or the plane of the sheet. If silicon steel is reduced
in thickness by rolling in the cold state and the mate-
rial is then annealed it is possible to obtain a finished
sheet in which the crystals are nearly all approximately
parallel to one another. The material has strongly direc-
tional magnetic properties, the rolling direction being
the direction of highest permeability. This direction is
also the direction of lowest hysteresis loss. This type of
material is particularly suitable for use in transformers,
since the axis of the core can be made to correspond with
the rolling direction of the sheet and thus full use is made
of the high permeability, low loss direction of the sheet.

With silicon—iron alloys a maximum magnetic flux
density of about 2 T is possible. With cold-rolled
silicon-steel, used for large machine construction, a
maximum flux density of 2.5 T is possible, whereas
the maximum obtainable with the hot-rolling process
is about 1.8 T. (In fact, with any material, only under
the most abnormal of conditions will the value of flux
density exceed 3 T)

It should be noted that the term ‘iron-core’ implies
that the core is made of iron; itis, in fact, almost certainly
made from steel, pure iron being extremely hard to come
by. Equally, an iron alloy is generally a steel and so it is
preferred to describe a core as being a steel rather than
an iron core.

Nickel-iron alloys

Nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic elements and
when they are alloyed together in different propor-
tions a series of useful magnetic alloys is obtained.
With about 25%—30% nickel content added to iron, the
alloy tends to be very hard and almost non-magnetic
at room temperature. However, when the nickel con-
tent is increased to, say, 75%—80% (together with small
amounts of molybdenum and copper), very high val-
ues of initial and maximum permeabilities and very low
values of hysteresis loss are obtainable if the alloys are


562 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

given suitable heat treatment. For example, Permalloy,
having a content of 78% nickel, 3% molybdenum and
the remainder iron, has an initial permeability of 20000
and a maximum permeability of 100000 compared with
values of 250 and 5 000, respectively, for iron. The max-
imum flux density for Permalloy is about 0.8 T. Mumetal
(76% nickel, 5% copper and 2% chromium) has simi-
lar characteristics. Such materials are used for the cores
of current and a.f. transformers, for magnetic amplifiers
and also for magnetic screening. However, nickel—iron
alloys are limited in that they have a low saturation value
when compared with iron. Thus, in applications where
it is necessary to work at a high flux density, nickel—
iron alloys are inferior to both iron and silicon-iron.
Also nickel—iron alloys tend to be more expensive than
silicon-iron alloys.

Eddy current loss is proportional to the thickness of
lamination squared, thus such losses can be reduced by
using laminations as thin as possible. Nickel—iron alloy
strip as thin as 0.004mm, wound in a spiral, may be
used.

Dust cores

In many circuits high permeability may be unnecessary
or it may be more important to have a very high resis-
tivity. Where this is so, metal powder or dust cores are
widely used up to frequencies of 150 MHz. These con-
sist of particles of nickel-iron—molybdenum for lower
frequencies and iron for the higher frequencies. The par-
ticles, which are individually covered with an insulating
film, are mixed with an insulating, resinous binder and
pressed into shape.

Ferrites

Magnetite, or ferrous ferrite, is a compound of fer-
ric oxide and ferrous oxide and possesses magnetic
properties similar to those of iron. However, being a
semiconductor, it has a very high resistivity. Manufac-
tured ferrites are compounds of ferric oxide and an oxide
of some other metal such as manganese, nickel or zinc.
Ferrites are free from eddy current losses at all but the
highest frequencies (i.e. > 100 MHz), but have a much
lower initial permeability compared with nickel—iron
alloys or silicon—iron alloys. Ferrites have typically a
maximum flux density of about 0.4 T. Ferrite cores are
used in audio-frequency transformers and inductors.

38.7 Permanent magnetic materials

A permanent magnet is one in which the material used
exhibits magnetism without the need for excitation by
a current-carrying coil. The silicon—iron and nickel—
iron alloys discussed in Section 38.6 are ‘soft’ magnetic
materials having high permeability and hence low hys-
teresis loss. The opposite characteristics are required in
the ‘hard’ materials used to make permanent magnets.
In permanent magnets, high remanent flux density and
high coercive force, after magnetization to saturation,
are desirable in order to resist demagnetization. The hys-
teresis loop should embrace the maximum possible area.
Possibly the best criterion of the merit of a permanent
magnet is its maximum energy product (BH),», i.e. the
maximum value of the product of the flux density B and
the magnetic field strength H along the demagnetization
curve (shown as cd in Figure 38.2). A rough criterion is
the product of coercive force and remanent flux density,
i.e. (Od)(O0c) in Figure 38.2. The earliest materials used
for permanent magnets were tungsten and chromium
steel, followed by a series of cobalt steels, to give
both a high remanent flux density and a high value
of (BH) mn.

Alni was the first of the aluminium-nickel—iron alloys
to be discovered, and with the addition of cobalt, tita-
nium and niobium, the Alnico series of magnets was
developed, the properties of which vary according to
composition. These materials are very hard and brittle.
Many alloys with other compositions and trade names
are commercially available.

A considerable advance was later made when it was
found that directional magnetic properties could be
induced in alloys of suitable composition if they were
heated in a strong magnetic field. This discovery led to
the powerful Alcomex and Hycomex series of magnets.
By using special casting techniques to give a grain-
oriented structure, even better properties are obtained
if the field applied during heat treatment is parallel to
the columnar crystals in the magnet. The values of coer-
civity, the remanent flux density and hence (BH), are
high for these alloys.

The most recent and most powerful permanent mag-
nets discovered are made by powder metallurgy tech-
niques and are based on an intermetallic compound of
cobalt and samarium. These are very expensive and are
only available in a limited range of small sizes.

Chapter 39

Dielectrics and dielectric loss

Why it is important to understand: Dielectric and dielectric loss

Dielectric loss is the loss of energy that goes into heating a dielectric material in a varying electric field. For
example, a capacitor incorporated in an a.c. circuit is alternately charged and discharged each half-cycle.
During the alternation of polarity of the plates, the charges must be displaced through the dielectric
first in one direction and then in the other, and overcoming the opposition that they encounter leads
to a production of heat through dielectric loss, a characteristic that must be considered when applying
capacitors to electric circuits, such as those in radio and television receivers. Dielectric losses depend
on frequency and the dielectric material. Heating through dielectric loss is widely employed industrially
for heating thermosetting glues, for drying lumber and other fibrous materials, for preheating plastics
before moulding and for fast jelling and drying of foam rubber. An important property of a dielectric
is its ability to support an electrostatic field while dissipating minimal energy in the form of heat. The
lower the dielectric loss (the proportion of energy lost as heat), the more effective is a dielectric material.
The study of dielectric properties is concerned with the storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic
energy in materials. It is important to explain various phenomena in electronics, optics and solid-state
physics. This chapter assesses the dielectric properties of materials, and determines, via calculations,
dielectric loss, loss angle, Q-factor and dissipation factor of capacitors.

dielectric materials have very high resistivities (and
hence low conductance, since p = 1/o). They are there-
fore used to separate conductors at different potentials,
such as capacitor plates or electric power lines.

39.2 Polarization

When a dielectric is placed between charged plates, the
capacitance of the system increases. The mechanism by
which a dielectric increases capacitance is called polar-
ization. In an electric field the electrons and atomic
nuclei of the dielectric material experience forces in
opposite directions. Since the electrons in an insulator
cannot flow, each atom becomes a tiny dipole (i.e. an
arrangement of two electric charges of opposite polarity)
with positive and negative charges slightly separated, 1.e.
the material becomes polarized.

Within the material this produces no discernible
effects. However, on the surfaces of the dielectric, layers
of charge appear. Electrons are drawn towards the pos-
itive potential, producing a negative charge layer, and
away from the negative potential, leaving positive sur-
face charge behind. Therefore the dielectric becomes
a volume of neutral insulator with surface charges of
opposite polarity on opposite surfaces. The result of
this is that the electric field inside the dielectric is
less than the electric field causing the polarization,
because these two charge layers give rise to a field which
opposes the electric field causing it. Since electric field
strength, E = V/d, the p.d. between the plates, V = Ed.
Thus, if & decreases when the dielectric is inserted,
then V falls too and this drop in p.d. occurs without
change of charge on the plates. Thus, since capacitance
C= (Q/V, capacitance increases, this increase being by
a factor equal to ¢, above that obtained with a vacuum
dielectric.

There are two main ways in which polarization takes
place:

capacitance C =

(i) The electric field, as explained above, pulls the
electrons and nuclei in opposite directions because
they have opposite charges, which makes each
atom into an electric dipole. The movement is only
small and takes place very fast since the electrons
are very light. Thus, if the applied electric field
is varied periodically, the polarization, and hence
the permittivity due to these induced dipoles,

is independent of the frequency of the applied
field.

(ii) Some atoms have a permanent electric dipole as
a result of their structure and, when an electric
field is applied, they turn and tend to align along
the field. The response of the permanent dipoles is
slower than the response of the induced dipoles
and that part of the relative permittivity which
arises from this type of polarization decreases with
increase of frequency.

Most materials contain both induced and perma-
nent dipoles, so the relative permittivity usually
tends to decrease with increase of frequency.

39.3 Dielectric strength

The maximum amount of field strength that a dielectric
can withstand is called the dielectric strength of the
material. When an electric field is established across
the faces of a material, molecular alignment and dis-
tortion of the electron orbits around the atoms of the
dielectric occur. This produces a mechanical stress
which in turn generates heat. The production of heat
represents a dissipation of power, such a loss being
present in all practical dielectrics, especially when used
in high-frequency systems where the field polarity is
continually and rapidly changing.

A dielectric whose conductivity is not zero between
the plates of a capacitor provides a conducting path
along which charges can flow and thus discharge the
capacitor. The resistance R of the dielectric is given
by R=pl/a, | being the thickness of the dielectric film
(which may be as small as 0.001 mm) and a being the
area of the capacitor plates. The resistance R of the
dielectric may be represented as a leakage resistance
across an ideal capacitor (see Section 39.8 on dielectric
loss). The required lower limit for acceptable resis-
tance between the plates varies with the use to which
the capacitor is put. High-quality capacitors have high
shunt-resistance values. A measure of dielectric quality
is the time taken for a capacitor to discharge a given
amount through the resistance of the dielectric. This is
related to the product CR.

thus CR is a characteristic of a given dielectric. In prac-
tice, circuit design is considerably simplified if the shunt
conductance of a capacitor can be ignored (i.e. R > 00)


566 — Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

and the capacitor therefore regarded as an open circuit
for direct current.

Since capacitance C of a parallel plate capacitor is
given by C=é9¢,A/d, reducing the thickness d of a
dielectric film increases the capacitance, but decreases
the resistance. It also reduces the voltage the capacitor
can withstand without breakdown (since V= Q/C). Any
material will eventually break down, usually destruc-
tively, when subjected to a sufficiently large electric
field. A spark may occur at breakdown which produces a
hole through the film. The metal film forming the metal
plates may be welded together at the point of breakdown.

Breakdown depends on electric field strength E
(where EF = V/d), so thinner films will break down with
smaller voltages across them. This is the main rea-
son for limiting the voltage that may be applied to a
capacitor. All practical capacitors have a safe working
voltage stated on them, generally at a particular maxi-
mum temperature. Figure 39.1 shows the typical shapes
of graphs expected for electric field strength E plot-
ted against thickness and for breakdown voltage plotted
against thickness. The shape of the curves depend on a
number of factors, and these include:

(i) the type of dielectric material,

(ii) the shape and size of the conductors associated
with it,

(iii) the atmospheric pressure,
(iv) the humidity/moisture content of the material,
(v) the operating temperature.

Dielectric strength is an important factor in the design
of capacitors as well as transformers and high-voltage
insulators, and in motors and generators. Dielectrics
vary in their ability to withstand large fields. Some
typical values of dielectric strength, together with resis-
tivity and relative permittivity, are shown in Table 39.1.
The ceramics have very high relative permittivities and
they tend to be ‘ferroelectric’, i.e. they do not lose

their polarities when the electric field is removed. When
ferroelectric effects are present, the charge on a capac-
itor is given by Q = (CV)+(remanent polarization).
These dielectrics often possess an appreciable nega-
tive temperature coefficient of resistance. Despite this,
a high permittivity is often very desirable and ceramic
dielectrics are widely used.

39.4 Thermal effects

As the temperature of most dielectrics is increased, the
insulation resistance falls rapidly. This causes the leak-
age current to increase, which generates further heat.
Eventually a condition known as thermal avalanche or
thermal runaway may develop, when the heat is gener-
ated faster than it can be dissipated to the surrounding
environment. The dielectric will burn and thus fail.

Thermal effects may often seriously influence the
choice and application of insulating materials. Some
important factors to be considered include:

(i) the melting-point (for example, for waxes used
in paper capacitors),
(ii) ageing due to heat,
(iii) the maximum temperature that a material
will withstand without serious deterioration of
essential properties,

(iv)  flash-point or ignitability,
(v) resistance to electric arcs,
(vi) the specific heat capacity of the material,

(vii) thermal resistivity,

Dielectrics and dielectricloss 567

(viii) the coefficient of expansion,

(ix) the freezing-point of the material.

39.5 Mechanical properties

Mechanical properties determine, to varying degrees,
the suitability of a solid material for use as an insulator:
tensile strength, transverse strength, shearing strength
and compressive strength are often specified. Most
solid insulations have a degree of inelasticity and many
are quite brittle, thus it is often necessary to consider
features such as compressibility, deformation under
bending stresses, impact strength and extensibility,
tearing strength, machinability and the ability to fold
without damage.

39.6 Types of practical capacitor

Practical types of capacitor are characterized by the
material used for their dielectric. The main types include:
variable air, mica, paper, ceramic, plastic, titanium
oxide and electrolytic, together with supercapacitors.
Refer back to Chapter 6, Section 6.12, page 65, for a
description of each type.

39.7 Liquid dielectrics and gas

insulation

Liquid dielectrics used for insulation purposes are
refined mineral oils, silicone fluids and synthetic oils
such as chlorinated diphenyl. The principal uses of liq-
uid dielectrics are as a filling and cooling medium for
transformers, capacitors and rheostats, as an insulat-
ing and arc-quenching medium in switchgear such as
circuit breakers, and as an impregnant of absorbent insu-
lations — for example, wood, slate, paper and pressboard,
used mainly in transformers, switchgear, capacitors and
cables.

Two gases used as insulation are nitrogen and
sulphur hexafluoride. Nitrogen is used as an insulation
medium in some sealed transformers and in power
cables, and sulphur hexafluoride is finding increasing
use in switchgear both as an insulant and as an arc-
extinguishing medium.

39.8 Dielectric loss and loss angle

In capacitors with solid dielectrics, losses can be
attributed to two causes:

(i) dielectric hysteresis, a phenomenon by which
energy is expended and heat produced as the result
of the reversal of electrostatic stress in a dielectric
subjected to alternating electric stress — this loss is
analogous to hysteresis loss in magnetic materials;

(ii) leakage currents that may flow through the
dielectric and along surface paths between the
terminals.

The total dielectric loss may be represented as the loss
in an additional resistance connected between the plates.
This may be represented as either a small resistance in
series with an ideal capacitor or as a large resistance in
parallel with an ideal capacitor.

Series representation

The circuit and phasor diagrams for the series represen-
tation are shown in Figure 39.2. The circuit phase angle
is shown as angle ¢. If resistance Rg is zero then current
I would lead voltage V by 90°, this being the case of
a perfect capacitor. The difference between 90° and the
circuit phase angle ¢ is the angle shown as 0. This is
known as the loss angle of the capacitor, i.e.

loss angle, 5 = (90°— 9)

Field theory

The conductor and sheath of coaxial cables, such as a telegraph cable and single-conductor lead-sheath
power cable, are concentric cylinders. The capacitance between the inner cylinder, the conductor, and
outer cylinder, the sheath or shield, has an important effect on the characteristics of such cables. Whenever
two nearby conductors of any size or shape carry equal and opposite charges, the combination of these
conducting bodies is called a capacitor. Because the isolated conducting bodies have equal but opposite
charges on them, an electric field exists in the space between them. The importance of the capacitor
lies in the fact that energy can be stored in the electric field between the two conducting bodies. The
main properties of a co-axial cable are its inductance, capacitance, effective shunt conductance and series
resistance per unit length. Taken together these influence the signal transmission and loss properties when
a length of cable is employed as part of a system. This chapter looks at some aspects of field theory — field
plotting, capacitance and inductance of concentric cylinders, capacitance and inductance of isolated twin
line and energy stored in electric and electromagnetic fields.

40.1 Field plotting by curvilinear

squares

Electric fields, magnetic fields and conduction fields
(i.e. aregion in which an electric current flows) are ana-
logous, i.e. they all exhibit similar characteristics. Thus
they may all be analysed by similar processes. In the
following the electric field is analysed.

Figure 40.1 shows two parallel plates, A and B. Let
the potential on plate A be +V volts and that on plate
B be —V volts. The force acting on a point charge of |
coulomb placed between the plates is the electric field
strength FE. Itis measured in the direction of the field and
its magnitude depends on the p.d. between the plates and
the distance between the plates. In Figure 40.1, moving
along a line of force from plate B to plate A means
moving from —V to +V volts. The p.d. between the
plates is therefore 2 V volts and this potential changes
linearly when moving from one plate to the other. Hence
a potential gradient is followed which changes by equal
amounts for each unit of distance moved.

Lines may be drawn connecting together all points
within the field having equal potentials. These lines are
called equipotential lines and these have been drawn in
Figure 40.1 for potentials of 3 V, ; V, 0, —4 V and —3 V.
The zero equipotential line represents earth potential
and the potentials on plates A and B are respectively
above and below earth potential. Equipotential lines
form part of an equipotential surface. Such surfaces are
parallel to the plates shown in Figure 40.1 and the plates
themselves are equipotential surfaces. There can be no
current flow between any given points on such a surface
since all points on an equipotential surface have the same
potential. Thus a line of force (or flux) must intersect an
equipotential surface at right-angles. A line of force in
an electrostatic field is often termed a streamline.

An electric field distribution for a concentric cylin-
der capacitor is shown in Figure 40.2. An electric field
is set up in the insulating medium between two good
conductors. Any volt drop within the conductors can
usually be neglected compared with the p.d.s across

Figure 40.1 Lines of force intersecting equipotential lines in
an electric field

der capacitor

the insulation since the conductors have a high con-
ductivity. All points on the conductors are thus at the
same potential so that the conductors form the bound-
ary equipotentials for the electrostatic field. Streamlines
(or lines of force) which must cut all equipotentials
at right-angles leave one boundary at right-angles,
pass across the field and enter the other boundary at
right-angles.

Ina magnetic field, a streamline is a line so drawn that
its direction is everywhere parallel to the direction of the
magnetic flux. An equipotential surface in a magnetic
field is the surface over which a magnetic pole may be
moved without the expenditure of work or energy.

In aconduction field, a streamline is a line drawn with
a direction which is everywhere parallel to the direction
of the current flow.

A method of solving certain field problems by a
form of graphical estimation is available which may
only be applied, however, to plane linear fields; exam-
ples include the field existing between parallel plates
or between two long parallel conductors. In general,
the plane of a field may be divided into a number of
squares formed between the line of force (i.e. stream-
line) and the equipotential. Figure 40.3 shows a typical
pattern. In most cases true squares will not exist, since
the streamlines and equipotentials are curved. However,
since the streamlines and the equipotentials intersect at
right-angles, square-like figures are formed, and these
are usually called ‘curvilinear squares’. The square-
like figure shown in Figure 40.3 is a curvilinear square
since, on successive sub-division by equal numbers of

Field theory 573

intermediate streamlines and equipotentials, the smaller
figures are seen to approach a true square form.

When sub-dividing to give a field in detail, and in
some cases for the initial equipotentials, ‘Moore’s cir-
cle’ technique can be useful in that it tends to eliminate
the trial and error process. If, say, two flux lines and
an equipotential are given and it is required to draw
a neighbouring equipotential, a circle tangential to the
three given lines is constructed. The new equipotential
is then approximately tangential to the circle, as shown
in Figure 40.3.

Consider the electric field established between two
parallel metal plates, as shown in Figure 40.4. The
streamlines and the equipotential lines are shown
sketched and are seen to form curvilinear squares. Con-
sider a true square abcd lying between equipotentials
AB and CD. Let this square be the end of x metres
depth of the field forming a flux tube between adja-
cent equipotential surfaces abfe and cdhg as shown in
Figure 40.5. Let / be the length of side of the squares.
Then the capacitance C of the flux tube is given by

é0éy (area of plate)
Ch =

plate separation

_ €0ér(lx)

ie. Cy i

= €08/Xx (1)
Thus the capacitance of the flux tube whose end is a true
square is independent of the size of the square.

Let the distance between the plates of a capacitor
be divided into an exact number of parts, say n
(in Figure 40.4, n=4). Using the same scale, the

Figure 40.5

breadth of the plate is divided into a number of
parts (which is not always an integer value), say m
(in Figure 40.4, m=10, neglecting fringing). Thus
between equipotentials AB and CD in Figure 40.4
there are m squares in parallel and so there are m
capacitors in parallel. For m capacitors connected in
parallel, the equivalent capacitance Cy is given by
Cr=C,+C2+C3+---+Cm. If the capacitors have
the same value, i.e. Cy = C2 = C3 =--- =Cy =C;, then

Cr =mC, (2)

Similarly, there are n squares in series in Figure 40.4
and thus 7 capacitors in series.

For n capacitors connected in series, the equivalent
capacitance Cy is given by

Potty yd
Cr Ci G& Ch
If Cy=Co=---=Cy,=C; then 1/Cr=n/C;, from
which
Cc
Cr=— (3)
n

Thus if m is the number of parallel squares measured
along each equipotential and n is the number of series
squares measured along each streamline (or line of
force), then the total capacitance C of the field is given,
from equations (1)—(3), by

C= Pree farads (4)
n

For example, let a parallel-plate capacitor have plates
8mm x 5mm and spaced 4mm apart (see Figure 40.6).
Let the dielectric have a relative permittivity 3.5.
If the distance between the plates is divided into, say,
four equipotential lines, then each is 1 mm apart. Hence
n=4,

Using the same scale, the number of lines of force
from plate P to plate Q must be 8, i.e. m=8. This
is, of course, neglecting any fringing. From equa-
tion (4), capacitance C =e9é,x(m/n), where x =5mm
or 0.005 m in this case. Hence

C = (8.85 x 107!*)(3.5)(0.005) ($) = 0.31 pF

Figure 40.6

plate capacitor,

The capacitance found by each method gives the same
value; this is expected since the field is uniform between
the plates, giving a field plot of true squares.)

The effect of fringing may be considered by estimat-
ing the capacitance by field plotting. This is described
below.

In the side view of the plates shown in Figure 40.7, RS is
the medial line of force or medial streamline, by symme-
try. Also XY is the medial equipotential. The field may
thus be divided into four separate symmetrical parts.

Figure 40.7

Considering just the top-left part of the field, the
field plot is estimated as follows, with reference to
Figure 40.8:

(i) Estimate the position of the equipotential EF
which has the mean potential between that of the
plate and that of the medial equipotential X0. F
is not taken too far since it is difficult to estimate.
Point E will lie slightly closer to point Z than
point O.

(ii) Estimate the positions of intermediate equipoten-
tials GH and IJ.

(iii) All the equipotential lines plotted are z, ie.

0.5 mm apart. Thus a series of streamlines, cutting
the equipotential at right-angles, are drawn, the
streamlines being spaced 0.5 mm apart, with the
object of forming, as far as possible, curvilinear
squares.

It may be necessary to erase the equipotentials and
redraw them to fit the lines of force. The field between
the plates is almost uniform, giving a field plot of true
squares in this region. At the corner of the plates the
squares are smaller, this indicating a great stress in this
region.

40.2 Capacitance between

concentric cylinders

A concentric cable is one which contains two or more
separate conductors, arranged concentrically (i.e. hav-
ing a common centre), with insulation between them.
In a coaxial cable, the central conductor, which may
be either solid or hollow, is surrounded by an outer
tubular conductor, the space in between being occupied
by a dielectric. If air is the dielectric then concen-
tric insulating discs are used to prevent the conductors
touching each other. The two kinds of cable serve dif-
ferent purposes. The main feature they have in common
is a complete absence of external flux and therefore a
complete absence of interference with and from other
circuits.

The electric field between two concentric cylinders
(i.e. a coaxial cable) is shown in the cross-section
of Figure 40.13. The conductors form the boundary
equipotentials for the field, the boundary equipotentials
in Figure 40.13 being concentric cylinders of radii a
and b. The streamlines, or lines of force, are radial lines
cutting the equipotentials at right-angles.

Let Q be the charge per unit length of the inner con-
ductor. Then the total flux across the dielectric per unit

Problem 3. A coaxial cable has an inner core

In(b/4.0) = 2.433 and b/4.0=e?493

Thus the internal radius of the sheath,
b=4.0e793 = 45.57mm.

Hence the internal diameter of the sheath

Dimensions of most economical cable

Concentric cable field plotting

Figure 40.14 shows a cross-section of a concentric cable
having a core radius r; and a sheath radius rq. It was
shown in Section 40.1 that the capacitance of a true
square is given by C=eoer farads/metre.

Figure 40.14

A curvilinear square is shown shaded in Figure 40. 14.
Such squares can be made to have the same capacitance
as a true square by the correct choice of spacing between
the lines of force and the equipotential surfaces in the
field plot.

From equation (7), the capacitance between cylindrical
equipotential lines at radii rg and rp is given by

Now if 6 =In(rp/rq) then C =éo¢é; F/m, the same as for

if, say, two equipotential surfaces are chosen within

Hence 30 = In4 and d= 5 In4=0.462 rad (or 26.47°).
Thus there will be 27/0.462 = 13.6 sectors in the field
plot. (Alternatively, 360°/26.47° = 13.6 sectors.) From

The field plot is shown in Figure 40.15. The number of
parallel squares measured along each equipotential is
13.6 and the number of series squares measured along
each line of force is 3. Hence in equation (4), where
C=e0e-x(m/n), m= 13.6 and n=3

= 32mm

fg = 20.15 mm

If the dielectric has a relative permittivity of, say, 2.5,
then the capacitance per metre length,

Thus field plotting using curvilinear squares provides
an alternative method of determining the capacitance
between concentric cylinders.

Problem 8. A concentric cable has a core
diameter of 20mm and a sheath inside diameter of
60mm. The permittivity of the dielectric is 3.2.
Using three equipotential surfaces within the
dielectric, determine the capacitance of the cable
per metre length by the method of curvilinear
squares. Draw the field plot for the cable.

The field plot consists of radial lines of force dividing
the cable cross-section into a number of sectors, the
lines of force cutting the equipotential surfaces at right-
angles. Since three equipotential surfaces are required
in the dielectric, four capacitors in series are found in
each sector of 6 radians.

In Figure 40.16, rj =20/2=10mm and rs =60/2=
30mm. It follows from equation (13) that

e? =rs/r; = 30/10 =3, from which 40 = In3 and

0 = } In3 =0.2747 rad.

Figure 40.16

Thus the number of sectors in the plot shown in
Figure 40.16 is 27/0.2747 = 22.9

The three equipotential lines are shown in Figure 40.16
at radii of r2, r3 and r4

Thus the field plot for the cable is as shown in
Figure 40.16.

From equation (4), capacitance C = ege,x(m/n). The

40.5 Induced e.m.f. and inductance

A current flowing in a coil of wire is accompanied by
a magnetic flux linking with the coil. If the current
changes, the flux linkage (i.e. the product of flux and
the number of turns) changes and an e.m.f. is induced
in the coil. The magnitude of the induced e.m.f. e in a
coil of N turns is given by

d
e=N dg volts
dt

where d¢/dt is the rate of change of flux.

Inductance is the name given to the property of a cir-
cuit whereby there is an e.m.f. induced into the circuit
by the change of flux linkages produced by a current
change. The unit of inductance is the henry,* H. A cir-
cuit has an inductance of | H when an e.m-f. of | V is
induced in it by a current changing uniformly at the rate
of | A/s.

The magnitude of the e.m.f. induced in a coil of
inductance L henry is given by

di
e= L— volts
dt

*Who was Henry? Go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

where di/dt is the rate of change of current.

If a current changing uniformly from zero to J
amperes produces a uniform flux change from zero to d
webers in ¢ seconds then (from above) average induced
e.m.f., Eqn =N¢/t =LI/, from which

N
inductance of coil, L = “s henry

Flux linkage means the product of flux, in webers,
and the number of turns with which the flux is linked.
Hence flux linkage= V¢. Thus since L = N¢/T, induc-
tance = flux linkages per ampere.

40.6 Inductance of a concentric

cylinder (or coaxial cable)

Skin effect

When a direct current flows in a uniform conductor the
current will tend to distribute itself uniformly over the
cross-section of the conductor. However, with alternat-
ing current, particularly if the frequency is high, the
current carried by the conductor is not uniformly dis-
tributed over the available cross-section, but tends to be
concentrated at the conductor surface. This is called skin
effect. When current is flowing through a conductor, the
magnetic flux that results is in the form of concentric
circles. Some of this flux exists within the conductor
and links with the current more strongly near the centre.
The result is that the inductance of the central part of
the conductor is greater than the inductance of the con-
ductor near the surface. This is because of the greater
number of flux linkages existing in the central region.
At high frequencies the reactance (X; =2zfL) of the
extra inductance is sufficiently large to seriously affect
the flow of current, most of which flows along the sur-
face of the conductor where the impedance is low, rather
than near the centre where the impedance is high.

Inductance due to internal linkages
at low frequency

When a conductor is used at high frequency the depth
of penetration of the current is small compared with the
conductor cross-section. Thus the internal linkages may
be considered as negligible and the circuit inductance is
that due to the fields in the surrounding space. However,
at very low frequency the current distribution is consid-
ered uniform over the conductor cross-section and the
inductance due to flux linkages has its maximum value.

Consider a conductor of radius R, as shown in
Figure 40.19, carrying a current J amperes uniformly

Attenuators

Attenuation is the gradual loss in intensity of any kind of flux through a medium. For instance, sunlight
is attenuated by dark glasses, X-rays are attenuated by lead and light and sound are attenuated by
water. In electrical engineering and telecommunications, attenuation affects the propagation of waves
and signals in electrical circuits, in optical fibres, as well as in air (radio waves). RF attenuators reduce
the level of the signal; this may be required to protect a stage from receiving a signal level that is too
high. An attenuator may be used to provide an accurate impedance match as most fixed attenuators
offer a well-defined impedance, or attenuators may be used in a variety of areas where signal levels
need to be controlled. Attenuation is a general term that refers to any reduction in the strength of a
signal. Attenuation occurs with any type of signal, whether digital or analogue. Sometimes called loss,
attenuation is a natural consequence of signal transmission over long distances. This chapter explains the
function of attenuation, logarithmic units and the design of T, z and L attenuator sections. In addition,
attenuation for two-port networks in cascade, and ABCD parameters for networks is explained.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

41.1 Introduction

An attenuator is a device for introducing a speci-
fied loss between a signal source and a matched load
without upsetting the impedance relationship necessary
for matching. The loss introduced is constant irrespec-
tive of frequency; since reactive elements (LZ or C) vary
with frequency, it follows that ideal attenuators are net-
works containing pure resistances. A fixed attenuator
section is usually known as a ‘pad’.

Attenuation is a reduction in the magnitude of a volt-
age or current due to its transmission over a line or
through an attenuator. Any degree of attenuation may
be achieved with an attenuator by suitable choice of
resistance values, but the input and output impedances
of the pad must be such that the impedance conditions
existing in the circuit into which it is connected are not
disturbed. Thus an attenuator must provide the correct
input and output impedances as well as providing the
required attenuation.

Attenuation sections are made up of resistances
connected as T or z arrangements (as introduced in
Chapter 34).

Two-port networks

Networks in which electrical energy is fed in at one pair
of terminals and taken out at a second pair of terminals
are called two-port networks. Thus an attenuator is a
two-port network, as are transmission lines, transform-
ers and electronic amplifiers. The network between the
input port and the output port is a transmission network
for which a known relationship exists between the input
and output currents and voltages. If a network contains
only passive circuit elements, such as in an attenuator,
the network is said to be passive; if a network contains
a source of e.m.f., such as in an electronic amplifier, the
network is said to be active.

Figure 41.1(a) shows a T-network, which is termed
symmetrical if Z4=Zp,; Figure 41.1(b) shows a
m-network which is symmetrical if Zep=Zr.
If ZaAZp in Figure 41.l(a) and ZeAZpr in
Figure 41.1(b), the sections are termed asymmetrical.
Both networks shown have one common terminal,
which may be earthed, and are therefore said to be
unbalanced. The balanced form of the T-network is
shown in Figure 41.2(a) and the balanced form of the
a -network is shown in Figure 41.2(b).

Symmetrical T- and z-attenuators are discussed in
Section 41.4 and asymmetrical attenuators are dis-
cussed in Sections 41.6 and 41.7. Before this it is

important to understand the concept of characteristic
impedance, which is explained generally in Section 41.2
(characteristic impedances will be used again in
Chapter 44), and logarithmic units, discussed in
Section 41.3. Another important aspect of attenuators,
that of insertion loss, is discussed in Section 41.5. To
obtain greater attenuation, sections may be connected
in cascade, and this is discussed in Section 41.8.
Finally, in Section 41.9, ABCD parameters are
explained.

41.2 Characteristic impedance

The input impedance of a network is the ratio of voltage
to current (in complex form) at the input terminals. With
a two-port network the input impedance often varies
according to the load impedance across the output ter-
minals. For any passive two-port network it is found
that a particular value of load impedance can always be
found which will produce an input impedance having
the same value as the load impedance. This is called
the iterative impedance for an asymmetrical network
and its value depends on which pair of terminals is
taken to be the input and which the output (there are
thus two values of iterative impedance, one for each
direction). For a symmetrical network there is only one
value for the iterative impedance and this is called the
characteristic impedance of the symmetrical two-port
network. Let the characteristic impedance be denoted
by Zo. Figure 41.3 shows a symmetrical T-network
terminated in an impedance Zo

Figure 41.3

Let the impedance ‘looking-in’ at the input port also
be Zo. Then Vj/7, = Zo = V2/Fn in Figure 41.3. From
circuit theory,

Zo= 7 =Zat a , since (Z4 + Zo)
is in parallel with Zz,
Zi,+ZaZp+ZaZo+ZaZpt+ZpZo
Za+Zpt+Zo
we. = Z7,+2ZaZp+ZaZo+ZpZo
Zat+Zpt+Zo
Thus

Zo(Za + Zp t+ Zo) =Z4 +2Z4Zp + ZaZo+ZpZo
ZoZa + ZoZpt+ Z = Zi +2Z4Zp+ZaZo+ZpZo
Le. Z = Zi +2Z,4Zp, from which

characteristic impedance, Zy = ./ (3 +2Z4Zp) (1)

If the output terminals of Figure 41.3 are
open-circuited, then the open-circuit impedance,
Zoc=Z,a+ Zz. If the output terminals of Figure 41.3
are short-circuited, then the short-circuit impedance,

T or a symmetrical z

Equations (1) to (3) are used later in this chapter.

41.3 Logarithmic ratios

The ratio of two powers P; and P2 may be expressed in
logarithmic form as shown in Chapter 10.

Let P; be the input power to a system and P2 the output
power.

If logarithms to base 10 are used, then the ratio is said
to be in bels, i.e. power ratio in bels=1g(P2/P,). The
bel is a large unit and the decibel (dB) is more often
used, where 10 decibels = 1 bel, i.e.

P
power ratio in decibels = 10 Ig (4)
1

The bel is named after Alexander Graham Bell.*
For example:

P2/P, power ratio (dB)

1 101g 1=0
100 101g 100=+20 (power gain)
1 1
To 10lg To —10 (power loss or attenuation)

If logarithms to base e (i.e. natural or Napierian loga-
rithms) are used, then the ratio of two powers is said to
be in nepers (Np), i.e.
L 1, P2
power ratio in nepers = — In— (5)
2 Pi
The neper is named after John Napier.*
Thus when the power ratio P)/P,;=5, the power
ratio in nepers= 5 In5=0.805Np, and when the
power ratio P)/P,;=0.1, the power ratio in
nepers = 51n0.1 =—1.15Np

“Who were Bell and Napier? Go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

The attenuation of filter sections and along a

transmission line are of an exponential form and it is
in such applications that the unit of the neper is used
(see Chapters 42 and 44).
If the powers P; and P, refer to power developed in
two equal resistors, R, then P; = V7/R and P)= VSIR.
Thus the ratio (from equation (4)) can be expressed by
the laws of logarithms as

In equations (4) to (9) the output-to-input ratio has
been used. However, the input-to-output ratio may also
be used. For example, in equation (6), the output-
to-input voltage ratio is expressed as 201g(V2/V) dB.
Alternatively, the input-to-output voltage ratio may be

Attenuators 597

expressed as 201g(V,/V>) dB, the only difference in the
values obtained being a difference in sign.
If201g(V2/V,) = 10 dB, say, then 20 1g(Vj/V2) = —10dB.
Thus if an attenuator has a voltage input V; of 50mV
and a voltage output V2 of 5 mV, the voltage ratio V>/V,
is 5/50 or 1/10. Alternatively, this may be expressed as
‘an attenuation of 10’, i.e. Vj/V2 = 10.

Problem 1. The ratio of output power to input
power in a system is

(a) 2, (b) 25, (c) 1000 and (d) zy.

Determine the power ratio in each case (i) in
decibels and (ii) in nepers.

(i) From equation (4),
power ratio in decibels = 10 lg(P2/P))

(a) When P2/P| =2, power ratio= 101g 2
=3dB
(b) When P2/P; =25, power ratio= 101g 25
=14dB
(c) When P2/P; = 1000, power ratio
= 101g 1000 =30dB
(d) When P2/P, = Too Power ratio
= 101g 74g =-20dB

(ii) From equation (5),
power ratio in nepers = 5 In(P2/P)
(a) When P2/P| =2, power ratio
= +1In2=0.347Np
(b) When P3/P; =25, power ratio= 5 In25
=1.609 Np
(c) When P2/P; = 1000, power ratio

=41n 1000 =3.454Np

(d) When P2/P, = iw power ratio= 5 In Ww

= —2.303Np

The power ratios in (a), (b) and (c) represent power
gains, since the ratios are positive values; the power
ratio in (d) represents a power loss or attenuation, since
the ratio is a negative value.

Problem 2. 5% of the power supplied to a cable
appears at the output terminals. Determine the
attenuation in decibels.

If P| =input power and P, = output power, then
P 5
— = —_ = 0.05
P, 100

From equation (4), power ratio in decibels
= 101g(P)/P)) = 101g0.05 = —13dB

Hence the attenuation (i.e. power loss) is 13 dB

Problem 3. An amplifier has a gain of 15 dB. If
the input power is 12 mW, determine the output
power.

From equation (4), decibel power ratio= 10 1g(P2/P1)
Hence 15=101g(P2/12), where P2 is the output power

in milliwatts.

(b) the current ratio expressed in decibels. Assume
that the input and load resistances of the attenuator

41.4 Symmetrical T- and

z-attenuators

(a) Symmetrical T-attenuator

As mentioned in Section 41.1, the ideal attenuator is
made up of pure resistances. A symmetrical T-pad atten-
uator is shown in Figure 41.5 with a termination Ro
connected as shown. From equation (1),

Ro = J(Rj + 2R1R2) (10)

and from equation (2) Ry = ./(RocRsc) (11)

With resistance Ro as the termination, the input resis-
tance of the pad will also be equal to Ro. If the

i, Ay Ay

Por 4

Figure 41.5 Symmetrical T-pad attenuator

terminating resistance Ro is transferred to port A then
the input resistance looking into port B will again be Ro.

The pad is therefore symmetrical in impedance in
both directions of connection and may thus be inserted
into a network whose impedance is also Ro. The value
of Ro is the characteristic impedance of the section.

As stated in Section 41.3, attenuation may be
expressed as a voltage ratio V;/V2 (see Figure 41.5) or
quoted in decibels as 201g¢(Vj/V2) or, alternatively, as a
power ratio as 101g(P;/P2). If a T-section is symmetri-
cal, i.e. the terminals of the section are matched to equal
impedances, then

Let N=Vj/V2 or Iy/In or ./(Pi/P2), where N is the

for a matched network, i.e. one terminated in its charac-
teristic impedance, N is in fact the insertion loss ratio.
(Note that in an asymmetrical network, only the expres-
sion N =./(P;/P2) may be used — see Section 41.7 on

the L-section attenuator.)

Attenuators 599

From equation (12) and also equation (10), it is possible
to derive expressions for R; and R» in terms of N and
Ro, thus enabling an attenuator to be designed to give a
specified attenuation and to be matched symmetrically
into the network. From equation (12),
N(Ro — Ri) = Ro+ Ri

Hence

Ro =o ( 2N ) (14)

N?-1

Thus if the characteristic impedance Ro and the
attenuation N (=Vj/V2) are known for a symmetrical
T-network then values of R; and Rz may be calculated.
Figure 41.6 shows a T-pad attenuator having input and
output impedances of Ro with resistances R; and Ro
expressed in terms of Ro and N.

Iterative impedance is the term used for the
impedance measured at one port of a two-port network
when the other port is terminated with an impedance
of the same value. For example, the impedance looking
into port | of Figure 41.26(a) is, say, 500 Q when port 2
is terminated in 500 Q and the impedance looking into
port 2 of Figure 41.26(b) is, say, 600 Q when port 1 is
terminated in 600 Q. (In symmetric T- and z-sections
the two iterative impedances are equal, this value being
the characteristic impedance of the section.)

An image impedance is defined as the impedance
which, when connected to the terminals of a network,
equals the impedance presented to it at the opposite
terminals. For example, the impedance looking into
port | of Figure 41.27(a) is, say, 400 QO when port 2 is
terminated in, say 750 Q, and the impedance seen look-
ing into port 2 (Figure 41.27(b)) is 750Q when port
1 is terminated in 400Q. An asymmetrical network is
correctly terminated when it is terminated in its image
impedance. (If the image impedances are equal, the
value is the characteristic impedance.)

41.8 Two-port networks in cascade

Often two-port networks are connected in cascade, i.e.
the output from the first network becomes the input to
the second network, and so on, as shown in Figure 41.44.
Thus an attenuator may consist of several cascaded


612 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

Figure 41.44 Two-port networks connected in cascade

sections so as to achieve a particular desired overall
performance.

If the cascade is arranged so that the impedance
measured at one port and the impedance with which
the other port is terminated have the same value, then
each section (assuming they are symmetrical) will have
the same characteristic impedance Zo and the last net-
work will be terminated in Zp. Thus each network will
have a matched termination and hence the attenuation
in decibels of section | in Figure 41.44 is given by
a, =201g(V1/V2). Similarly, the attenuation of section 2
is given by az =201g(V2/V3), and so on.

The overall attenuation is given by

by the laws of logarithms, i.e.
overall attenuation, a = a, +a2 +--+ +an-1 (27)

Thus the overall attenuation is the sum of the attenua-
tions (in decibels) of the matched sections.

Problem 16. Five identical attenuator sections are
connected in cascade. The overall attenuation is

70 dB and the voltage input to the first section is

20 mV. Determine (a) the attenuation of each
individual attenuation section, (b) the voltage
output of the final stage and (c) the voltage output
of the third stage.

(a) From equation (27), the overall attenuation is
equal to the sum of the attenuations of the
individual sections and, since in this case each
section is identical, the attenuation of each
section = 70/5 = 14 dB.

(b) If V;=the input voltage to the first stage and
Vo =the output of the final stage, then the overall
attenuation = 201g(Vj/Vo), i.e.

41.9 ABCDparameters

As mentioned earlier, a two-port network has a pair
of input terminals, shown as PQ in Figure 41.47, and
a pair of output terminals, shown as RS. When a volt-
age V, is applied to terminals PQ, the input and output
currents, 7; and Jy, flow and an output voltage V2 is
produced. There are therefore four variable quantities
Vi, 11, V2 and Jy for a two-port network. If the ele-
ments are assumed to be linear, then there are a number
of ways in which the relationships can be written. One
such method is termed ABCD parameters which we
consider in this chapter; there are others, however, such
as z-, y-, h- and g-parameters that are not considered
here.

For ABCD parameters, the input voltage V; and the
input current J; are specified in terms of the output
voltage V2 and current J) as follows:

Vi =AV2 —Bln (28)
I =CV2—Dhln (29)

A,B,C and D are constants for a particular network
and called parameters.

Since A and D are ratios, they have no units, while
B is an impedance in ohms, and C an admittance in
siemens.

These parameters are often called the general cir-
cuit or transmission parameters and are generally
used for the analysis of two-port networks which are
heavy current circuits or power frequency transmission
lines.

Problem 18. A two-port network has parameters
A=2+j, B=5Q, C=(1+j2)S and D=4. If the
output is a current of 80mA through a 20Q
resistive load, determine (a) the input voltage and
(b) the input current.

Since Jy =80mA and R2 =20Q then
Vo = In Ro =80 x 1073 x 20=1.6V

(a) From equation (28), voltage,

(b) From equation (29), current,

following transmission parameters: A =5,
B=25Q, C=0.04S and D=2. Determine the
values of the input impedance when the output is
(a) open-circuited, (b) short-circuited.

Figure 41.49(a) represents a two-port network whose

Substituting V =—BI/2 from equation (31) gives:

(BC — AD)(—BIn)

ie. I, =(AD-BOI,

I= = (BC — AD)(-h)

This is a theorem called the reciprocity theorem, which
states that if a voltage is applied to a linear passive net-
work at one terminal and produces a current at another,
then the same voltage applied to a second terminal will
produce the same current at the first terminal.

Since the same voltage has been applied at each of the
two terminals, then J} = Ip

Thus, AD—BC=1 (35)

This condition must be satisfied by any linear passive
network.

Problem 22. ‘Tests on a passive two-port network

Since Vj =20 V and /7 = —1 A, then 20 =— B(—1)

Thus, when A=2, B=20, C=0.05 and D=1:

Hence the network is passive.

Chapter 42

Filter networks

Why it is important to understand: Filter networks

In circuit theory, a filter is an electrical network that alters the amplitude and/or phase characteristics
of a signal with respect to frequency. Ideally, a filter will not add new frequencies to the input signal,
nor will it change the component frequencies of that signal, but it will change the relative amplitudes of
the various frequency components and/or their phase relationships. Filters are often used in electronic
systems to emphasize signals in certain frequency ranges and reject signals in other frequency ranges.
Electronic filters are electronic circuits which perform signal processing functions, specifically to remove
unwanted frequency components from the signal, to enhance wanted ones, or both. Filters are used in
electronic music to alter the harmonic content of a signal, which changes its timbre. Many of the filters
used in synthesizers are voltage-controlled filters, which allows the filter to be controlled by a signal
generated elsewhere in the synthesizer. The purpose of filters and an explanation of the various types of
filter is given in this chapter, including the design of ‘m-derived’ filter sections.

42.1 Introduction

A filter is a network designed to pass signals having fre-
quencies within certain bands (called pass-bands) with
little attenuation, but greatly attenuates signals within
other bands (called attenuation bands or stop-bands).

As explained in the previous chapter, an attenua-
tor network pad is composed of resistances only, the
attenuation resulting being constant and independent
of frequency. However, a filter is frequency sensitive
and is thus composed of reactive elements. Since cer-
tain frequencies are to be passed with minimal loss,
ideally the inductors and capacitors need to be pure

Filter networks 627

components since the presence of resistance results in
some attenuation at all frequencies.

Between the passband of a filter, where ideally the
attenuation is zero, and the attenuation band, where ide-
ally the attenuation is infinite, is the cut-off frequency,
this being the frequency at which the attenuation
changes from zero to some finite value.

A filter network containing no source of power is termed
passive, and one containing one or more power sources
is known as an active filter network.

The filters considered in this chapter are symmetrical
unbalanced T and z sections, the reactances used being
considered as ideal.

Filters are used for a variety of purposes in nearly
every type of electronic communications and control
equipment. The bandwidths of filters used in communi-
cations systems vary from a fraction of a hertz to many
megahertz, depending on the application.

42.2 Basic types of filter sections

(a) Low-pass filters

Figure 42.1 shows simple unbalanced T and z section
filters using series inductors and shunt capacitors. If
either section is connected into a network and a con-
tinuously increasing frequency is applied, each would
have a frequency-attenuation characteristic as shown
in Figure 42.2(a). This is an ideal characteristic and
assumes pure reactive elements. All frequencies are seen
to be passed from zero up to a certain value without
attenuation, this value being shown as f, the cut-off
frequency; all values of frequency above /f;, are atten-
uated. It is for this reason that the networks shown in
Figures 42.1(a) and (b) are known as low-pass filters.
The electrical circuit diagram symbol for a low-pass
filter is shown in Figure 42.2(b).

Figure 42.1

Summarizing, a low-pass filter is one designed to
pass signals at frequencies below a specified cut-off
frequency.

When rectifiers are used to produce the d.c. supplies
of electronic systems, a large ripple introduces undesir-
able noise and may even mask the effect of the signal

voltage. Low-pass filters are added to smooth the output
voltage waveform, this being one of the most common
applications of filters in electrical circuits.

Filters are employed to isolate various sections of a
complete system and thus to prevent undesired inter-
actions. For example, the insertion of low-pass decou-
pling filters between each of several amplifier stages and
a common power supply reduces interaction due to the
common power supply impedance.

(b) High-pass filters

Figure 42.3 shows simple unbalanced T and z section
filters using series capacitors and shunt inductors. If
either section is connected into a network and a con-
tinuously increasing frequency is applied, each would
have a frequency-attenuation characteristic as shown in
Figure 42.4(a).

Once again this is an ideal characteristic assuming
pure reactive elements. All frequencies below the cut-off
frequency f, are seen to be attenuated and all fre-
quencies above f, are passed without loss. It is for
this reason that the networks shown in Figures 42.3(a)
and (b) are known as high-pass filters. The electrical
circuit-diagram symbol for a high-pass filter is shown
in Figure 42.4(b).

Summarizing, a high-pass filter is one designed to
pass signals at frequencies above a specified cut-off
frequency.

Figure 42.4

The characteristics shown in Figures 42.2(a) and
42.4(a) are ideal in that they have assumed that there is
no attenuation at all in the passbands and infinite attenu-
ation in the attenuation bands. Both of these conditions
are impossible to achieve in practice. Due to resistance,
mainly in the inductive elements, the attenuation in the
passband will not be zero, and in a practical filter section
the attenuation in the attenuation band will have a finite
value. Practical characteristics for low-pass and high-
pass filters are discussed in Sections 42.5 and 42.6. In
addition to the resistive loss there is often an added loss
due to mismatching. Ideally, when a filter is inserted
into a network it is matched to the impedance of that
network. However, the characteristic impedance of a
filter section will vary with frequency and the termi-
nation of the section may be an impedance that does
not vary with frequency in the same way. To minimize
losses due to resistance and mismatching, filters are used
under image impedance conditions as far as possible
(see Chapter 41).

(c) Band-pass filters

A band-pass filter is one designed to pass signals with
frequencies between two specified cut-off frequencies.
The characteristic of an ideal band-pass filter is shown
in Figure 42.5.

Such a filter may be formed by cascading a high-pass
and a low-pass filter. fc,, is the cut-off frequency of the
high-pass filter and fc, is the cut-off frequency of the
low-pass filter. As can be seen, fc, > fc, for a band-
pass filter, the passband being given by the difference
between these values. The electrical circuit diagram
symbol for a band-pass filter is shown in Figure 42.6.

Crystal and ceramic devices are used extensively as
band-pass filters. They are common in the intermediate-
frequency amplifiers of vhf radios where a precisely-
defined bandwidth must be maintained for good
performance.

(d) Band-stop filters

A band-stop filter is one designed to pass signals with all
frequencies except those between two specified cut-off
frequencies. The characteristic of an ideal band-stop fil-
ter is shown in Figure 42.7. Such a filter may be formed
by connecting a high-pass and a low-pass filter in par-
allel. As can be seen, for a band-stop filter fc, > fc,;
the stop-band being given by the difference between
these values. The electrical circuit diagram symbol for
a band-stop filter is shown in Figure 42.8.

Filter networks 629

Sometimes, as in the case of interference from 50 Hz
power lines in an audio system, the exact frequency of
a spurious noise signal is known. Usually such interfer-
ence is from an odd harmonic of 50Hz, for example,
250Hz. A sharply tuned band-stop filter, designed to
attenuate the 250 Hz noise signal, is used to minimize the
effect of the output. A high-pass filter with cut-off fre-
quency greater than 250 Hz would also remove the inter-
ference, but some of the lower frequency components
of the audio signal would be lost as well.

42.3 The characteristic impedance

and the attenuation of filter
sections

Nature of the input impedance

Let a symmetrical filter section be terminated in an
impedance Zo. If the input impedance also has a value
of Zo, then Zo is the characteristic impedance of the
section.

Figure 42.9 shows a T section composed of reactive
elements X4 and Xg. If the reactances are of opposite
kind, then the input impedance of the section, shown
as Zo, when the output port is open or short-circuited,
can be either inductive or capacitive depending on the
frequency of the input signal.

For example, if X4 is inductive, say jX,, and Xg is
capacitive, say, —jXc, then from Figure 42.9,

Zoc = JX, —jXc = j (Xt — Xc)

(jX,)(—jXc)

and Zsc = jX, + -

Figure 42.9

Since X; =2zfL and Xc = (127fC) then Zoc and Zsc
can be inductive (i.e. positive reactance) or capacitive
(i.e. negative reactance) depending on the value of
frequency, f

Let the magnitude of the reactance on open-circuit
be Xoc and the magnitude of the reactance on short-
circuit be Xsc. Since the filter elements are all purely
reactive they may be expressed as jX gc or jX sc, where
Xoc and Xs¢ are real, being positive or negative in sign.
Four combinations of Zoc and Zsc are possible, these
being:

(i) Zoc=+jXoc and Zsc =—jX sc
Qi) Zoc=—JjXoc and Zsc = +)X sc
(iii) Zoc=+jXoc and Zsc=+jX sc
and (iv) Zoc=—jXgc and Zsc=—jX 5c
From general circuit theory, input impedance Zo is
given by:
Zo = J(ZocZsc)

Taking either of combinations (i) and (ii) above gives:

Zo = J(-i’XocXsc) = V(XocXsc),

which is real, thus the input impedance will be purely
resistive.
Taking either of combinations (iii) and (iv) above gives:

Zo =V(i°XocXsc) = +i V(XocXsc),

which is imaginary, thus the input impedance will be
purely reactive.

Thus since the magnitude and nature of Zoc and Zsc
depend upon frequency then so also will the magnitude
and nature of the input impedance Zo depend upon
frequency.

From equation (2), page 595, the characteristic impe-
dance is given by Zg =./(ZocZsc).
The following statements may be demonstrated to be
true for any filter:

(a) The attenuation is zero throughout the frequency
range for which the characteristic impedance is
purely resistive.

(b) The attenuation is finite throughout the frequency
range for which the characteristic impedance is
purely reactive.

To demonstrate statement (a) above:

Let the filter shown in Figure 42.10 be operating over a
range of frequencies such that Zo is purely resistive.
V, V.
From Figure 42.10, Zo = a
Qh bh
Power dissipated in the output termination,
P2=V2In cos ¢2=V2I2 (since ¢2=0 with a purely
resistive load).
Power delivered at the input terminals,

Pi = Vi I, cos¢, = Vi Ji (since ¢; = 0)

No power is absorbed by the filter elements since they
are purely reactive.

Hence P2= P}, Va=V; and h=,

Thus if the filter is terminated in Zo and operating in a
frequency range such that Zo is purely resistive, then all
the power delivered to the input is passed to the output
and there is therefore no attenuation.

To demonstrate statement (b) above:

Let the filter be operating over a range of frequencies
such that Zo is purely reactive.

; Vi, V2
Then, from Figure 42.10, — =jZp = —

q h

Thus voltage and current are at 90° to each other
which means that the circuit can neither accept nor
deliver any active power from the source to the load
(P = VI cos¢= VI cos 90° = VI(0) =0). There is there-
fore infinite attenuation, theoretically. (In practice, the
attenuation is finite, for the condition (Vj/I;) = (V2/I2)
can hold for V2 < Vj and J, < Ih, since the voltage and
current are 90° out of phase.)

Statements (a) and (b) above are important because
they can be applied to determine the cut-off frequency
point of any filter section simply from a knowledge of
the nature of Zo. In the pass band, Zo is real, and in
the attenuation band, Zo is imaginary. The cut-off fre-
quency is therefore at the point on the frequency scale at

which Zg changes from a real quantity to an imaginary
one, or vice versa (see Sections 42.5 and 42.6).

42.4 Ladder networks

Low-pass networks

Figure 42.11 shows a low-pass network arranged as a
ladder or repetitive network. Such a network may be
considered as a number of T or z sections in cascade.
In Figure 42.12(a), a T section may be taken from the
ladder by removing ABED, producing the low-pass fil-
ter section shown in Figure 42.13(a). The ladder has
been cut in the centre of each of its inductive ele-
ments hence giving L/2 as the series arm elements in
Figure 42.13(a).

Similarly, a z section may be taken from the ladder
shown in Figure 42.12(a) by removing FGJH, produc-
ing the low-pass filter section shown in Figure 42.13(b).
The shunt element C in Figure 42.12(a) may be regarded
as two capacitors in parallel, each of value C/2 as shown
in the part of the ladder redrawn in Figure 42.12(b).
(Note that for parallel capacitors, the total capacitance
Cr is given by

The ladder network of Figure 42.11 can thus either be
considered to be a number of the T networks shown in
Figure 42.13(a) connected in cascade, or a number of
the z networks shown in Figure 42.13(b) connected in
cascade.

It is shown in Section 44.3, page 676, that an infinite
transmission line may be reduced to a repetitive low-
pass filter network.

High-pass networks

Figure 42.14 shows a high-pass network arranged as
a ladder. As above, the repetitive network may be
considered as a number of T or z sections in cascade.

Figure 42.14

In Figure 42.15, a T section may be taken from the
ladder by removing ABED, producing the high-pass
filter section shown in Figure 42.16(a).

Note that the series arm elements are each 2C. This is
because two capacitors each of value 2C connected in
series gives a total equivalent value of C (i.e. for series
capacitors, the total capacitance Cr is given by

Cr C ul C2 r
Similarly, a z section may be taken from the ladder
shown in Figure 42.15 by removing FGJH, producing
the high-pass filter section shown in Figure 42.16(b).
The shunt element L in Figure 42.15(a) may be regarded
as two inductors in parallel, each of value 2L as shown
in the part of the ladder redrawn in Figure 42.15(b).

When the frequency is very low, w is small and the
term (w*L7/) in equation (1) (or the term (@*C7/A)
in equation (4)) may be neglected. The characteristic
impedance then becomes equal to ./(L/C), which
is purely resistive. This value of the characteristic
impedance is known as the design impedance or the

From equations (1) and (4) it is seen that the charac-
teristic impedance Zo varies with @, i.e. Zp varies with
frequency. Thus if the nominal impedance is made to

equal the load impedance into which the filter feeds then
the matching deteriorates as the frequency increases
from zero towards f.. Itis, however, convention to make
the terminating impedance equal to the value of Zg well
within the passband, i.e. to take the limiting value of Zo
as the frequency approaches zero. This limit is obviously
»/ (LIC). This means that the filter is properly terminated
at very low frequency but as the cut-off frequency is
approached becomes increasingly mismatched. This is
shown for a low-pass section in Figure 42.20 by curve
(a). It is seen that an increasing loss is introduced into
the passband. Curve (b) shows the attenuation due to
the same low-pass section being correctly terminated
at all frequencies. A curve lying somewhere between
curves (a) and (b) will usually result for each section if
several sections are cascaded and terminated in Ro, or
if a matching section is inserted between the low-pass
section and the load.

Zot Zia = Z1Z2 = Rb = constant (k).

A ladder network composed of reactances, the series
reactances being of opposite sign to the shunt reac-
tances (as in Figure 42.23) are called ‘constant-k’ filter
sections. Positive (i.e. inductive) reactance is directly
proportional to frequency, and negative (i.e. capacitive)
reactance is inversely proportional to frequency. Thus
the product of the series and shunt reactances is inde-
pendent of frequency (see equations (9) and (10)). The
constancy of this product has given this type of filter
its name.

From equation (10), it is seen that Zor and Zo,
will either be both real or both imaginary together
(since p= —1). Also, when Zo7 changes from real
to imaginary at the cut-off frequency, so will Zoz. The
two sections shown in Figures 42.17 and 42.18 will thus
have identical cut-off frequencies and thus identical
passbands. Constant-k sections of any kind of filter are
known as prototypes.

Figure 42.2(a), on page 627, showed an ideal low-pass

istic curve of a low-pass prototype filter section looks
more like that shown in Figure 42.25. The characteristic
may be improved somewhat closer to the ideal by con-
necting two or more identical sections in cascade. This
produces a much sharper cut-off characteristic, although
the attenuation in the passband is increased a little.

where Z, and Z2 are the total equivalent series and shunt

42.7 Propagation coefficient and

time delay in filter sections

Propagation coefficient

In Figure 42.35, let A, B and C represent identical fil-
ter sections, the current ratios (J)/I2), (I2/I3) and (13/14)
being equal.

o > >
Figure 42.35

Although the rate of attenuation is the same in each
section (i.e. the current output of each section is one half

Filter networks 643

of the current input) the amount of attenuation in each
is different (Section A attenuates by , A, B attenuates

by i A and C attenuates by ; A). The attenuation is in
fact in the form of a logarithmic decay and

(See Section 41.3, page 596, on logarithmic units.)

Unless Sections A, B and C in Figure 42.35 are purely
resistive there will be a phase change in each section.
Thus the ratio of the current entering a section to that
leaving it will be a phasor quantity having both modulus
and argument. The propagation constant which has no
units is a complex quantity given by:

y=at+jp (24)

where a is called the attenuation coefficient, measured
in nepers, and / the phase shift coefficient, measured
in radians. f is the angle by which a current leaving a
section lags behind the current entering it.

Variation in phase angle in the passband
of a filter

In practice, the low- and high-pass filter sections dis-
cussed in Sections 42.5 and 42.6 would possess a phase
shift between the input and output voltages which varies
considerably over the range of frequency comprising the
passband.

Let the low-pass prototype T section shown in
Figure 42.37 be terminated as shown in its nominal
impedance Ro. The input impedance for frequencies
much less than the cut-off frequency is thus also equal
to Ro and is resistive. The phasor diagram representing
Figure 42.37 is shown in Figure 42.38 and is produced
as follows:

(i) Vj; and J; are in phase (since the input impedance
is resistive)

in practice this is only usually valid up to a frequency of

stic is shown in Figure 42.39. At the cut-off frequency,
f =z rad. For frequencies within the attenuation band,
the phase shift is unimportant, since all voltages having

when angle f is small.
(a) Equation (28) shows that the time delay, or tran-

sit time, is independent of frequency. Thus a phase
shift which is proportional to frequency (equation (27))
results in a time delay which is independent of fre-
quency. Hence if the input to the filter section consists
of a complex wave composed of several harmonic com-
ponents of differing frequency, the output will consist
of a complex wave made up of the sum of correspond-
ing components all delayed by the same amount. There
will therefore be no phase distortion due to varying time
delays for the separate frequency components.

In practice, however, phase shift £ tends not to be
constant and the increase in time delay with rising fre-
quency causes distortion of non-sinusoidal inputs, this
distortion being superimposed on that due to the attenu-
ation of components whose frequency is higher than the
cut-off frequency.

At the cut-off frequency of a prototype low-pass filter,
the phase angle =z rad. Hence the time delay of a

C =2nF
(a) From equation (28),

(b) From equation (29), at the cut-off frequency,

time delay = SViLO) = 5 (44.7) = 70.2 us

Problem 13. A filter network comprising n
identical sections passes signals of all frequencies
up to 500 kHz and provides a total delay of 9.55 Ls.
If the nominal impedance of the circuit into which
the filter is inserted is 1 kQ, determine (a) the values
of the elements in each section and (b) the value

of n.

Cut-off frequency, f-=500x10°Hz and nominal
impedance Ro = 1000Q.

Since the filter passes frequencies up to 500 kHz then it
is a low-pass filter.

(a) From equations (6) and (7), for a low-pass filter

section,
. 1 1
capacitance, C = =

R 1
and inductance, L = 0 = 000
afe (500 x 103)

Thus if the section is a low-pass T section
then the inductance in each series arm will be
(L/2)=318.3 .H and the capacitance in the shunt
arm will be 636.6 pF

If the section is a low-pass z section then the
inductance in the series arm will be 636.64~H
and the capacitance in each shunt arm will be
(C/2)=318.3 pF

(b) From equation (28), the time delay for a single
section

= /(LC) = V[(636.6 x 10~°)(636.6 x 107!”)]

For a time delay of 9.55 «1s therefore, the number
of cascaded sections required is given by

Problem 14. A filter network consists of 8
sections in cascade having a nominal impedance
of 1 kQ. If the total delay time is 41s, determine
the component values for each section if the filter
is (a) a low-pass T network and (b) a high-pass
m network.

Since the total delay time is 41s then the delay time of
4

each of the 8 sections is 3, i.e. 0.5 ws.

Hence 0.5 x 107° = /(LC) (i)
Also, from equation (5), H cm 1000 (ii)

42.8 ‘'m-derived’ filter sections

(a) General

In a low-pass filter a clearly defined cut-off frequency
followed by a high attenuation is needed; in a high-pass
filter, high attenuation followed by a clearly defined cut-
off frequency is needed. It is not practicable to obtain
either of these conditions by wiring appropriate pro-
totype constant-k sections in cascade. An equivalent
section is therefore required having:

(i) the same cut-off frequency as the prototype but
with a rapid rise in attenuation beyond cut-off for
a low-pass type or a rapid decrease at cut-off from
a high attenuation for the high-pass type,

(ii) the same value of nominal impedance Ro as the
prototype at all frequencies (otherwise the two
forms could not be connected together without
mismatch).

If the two sections, i.e. the prototype and the equiva-
lent section, have the same value of Ro they will have
identical passbands.

The equivalent section is called an ‘m-derived’ fil-
ter section (for reasons as explained below) and is one
which gives a sharper cut-off at the edges of the passband
and a better impedance characteristic.

(b) T sections

A prototype T section is shown in Figure 42.44(a). Let
a new section be constructed from this section having a
series arm of the same type but of different value, say
mZ,, where m is some constant. (It is for this reason
that the new equivalent section is called an ‘m-derived’
section.) If the characteristic impedance Zor of the two
sections is to be the same then the value of the shunt
arm impedance will have to be different to Z2. Let this
be Z, as shown in Figure 42.44(b).

(30)

Thus impedance Z* consists of an impedance Z2/m in
series with an impedance Z)((1 —m?)/Am). An addi-
tional component has therefore been introduced into the
shunt arm of the m-derived section. The value of m can
range from 0 to 1, and when m=1, the prototype and
the m-derived sections are identical.

(c) wz sections

A prototype z section is shown in Figure 42.45(a). Let
a new section be constructed having shunt arms of the
same type but of different values, say Z2/m, where m is
some constant. If the characteristic impedance Zo, of
the two sections is to be the same then the value of the
series arm impedance will have to be different to Z1.
Let this be Z 1 as shown in Figure 42.45(b).

The value of Z' is determined as follows:

From equation (9), Zor Zoz =Z1Z2

Thus the characteristic impedance of the section shown
in Figure 42.45(a) is given by:

1. A low-pass filter section is required to have
a nominal impedance of 450 Q, a cut-off fre-
quency of 150kHz and a frequency of infinite

“m-derived’ T section filter.

2. Ina filter section it is required to have a cut-
off frequency of 1.2 MHz and a frequency of
infinite attenuation of 1.3 MHz. If the nominal
impedance of the line into which the filter is to
be inserted is 600 Q, determine suitable com-
ponent values if the section is an ‘m-derived’z
type.

3. Determine the component values of an ‘m-
derived’ T section filter having a nomi-
nal impedance of 600 Q, a cut-off frequency of
1220 Hz and a frequency of infinite attenuation
of 1100 Hz.

4. State the advantages of an ‘m-derived’ filter
section over its equivalent prototype. A fil-
ter section is to have a nominal impedance
of 500Q, a cut-off frequency of 5kHz and a
frequency of infinite attenuation of 4.5 kHz.
Determine the values of components if the
section is to be an “m-derived’ z filter.

42.9 Practical composite filters

In practice, filters to meet a given specification often
have to comprise a number of basic networks. For exam-
ple, a practical arrangement might consist of (i) a basic
prototype, in series with (ii) an ‘m-derived’ section,
with (iii) terminating half-sections at each end. The ‘m-
derived’ section improves the attenuation immediately
after cut-off, the prototype improves the attenuation well
after cut-off, whilst the terminating half-sections are
used to obtain a constant match over the pass-band.

Filter networks 653

Figure 42.53(a) shows an ‘m-derived’ low-pass T
section, and Figure 42.53(b) shows the same section cut
into two halves through AB, each of the two halves being
termed a ‘half-section’. The ‘m-derived’ half section
also improves the steepness of attenuation outside the
pass-band.

Figure 42.53

As shown in Section 42.8, the ‘m-derived’ filter
section is based on a prototype which presents its own
characteristic impedance at its terminals. Hence, for
example, the prototype of a 7 section leads to an ‘m-
derived’ T section and Zor = Zor(m) where Zor is the
characteristic impedance of the prototype and Zo7(m) is
the characteristic impedance of the ‘m-derived’ section.
It is shown in Figure 42.24 that Zor has a non-linear
characteristic against frequency; thus Zo7(m) will also
be non-linear.

Since from equation (9) Zo, =(Z1Z2/Zor), then the
characteristic impedance of the ‘m-derived’ z section,

ZZ _ 225
Zor(m) Zor

Zoz (m) =

where Z/ and Z;, are the equivalent values of impedance

Thus the characteristic of impedance against frequency
for m= 1 and m=0 shown in Figure 42.54 are the same
as shown in Figure 42.24. Further characteristics may
be drawn for values of m between 0 and | as shown.

It is seen from Figure 42.54 that when m=0.6 the
impedance is practically constant at Ro for most of
the passband. In a composite filter, ‘m-derived’ half-
sections having a value of m=0.6 are usually used at
each end to provide a good match to a resistive source
and load over the passband.

low-pass filter sections; similar curves may be con-
structed for m-derived high-pass filters with the two
curves shown in Figure 42.30 representing the limiting
values of m=0 and m=1

The value of m needs to be small for the frequency
of input attenuation, foo, to be close to the cut-off
frequency, f;. However, it is not practical to make
m very small, below 0.3 being very unusual.
When m=0.3, foo 1.05 f. (from equation (32)) and
when m=0.6, foo=1.25 f.. The effect of the value of
m on the frequency of infinite attenuation is shown in
Figure 42.55, although the ideal curves shown would be
modified a little in practice by resistance losses.

Problem 17. It is required to design a composite
filter with a cut-off frequency of 10kHz, a
frequency of infinite attenuation of 11.8 kHz and

Magnetically coupled circuits

Why it is important to understand: Magnetically coupled circuits

Magnetically coupled electric circuits are central to the operation of transformers and electric machines.
In the case of transformers, stationary circuits are magnetically coupled for the purpose of changing the
voltage and current levels. In the case of electric machines, circuits in relative motion are magnetically
coupled for the purpose of transferring energy between mechanical and electrical systems. Because
magnetically coupled circuits play such an important role in power transmission and conversion, it is
important to establish the equations that describe their behaviour and to express these equations in a
form convenient for analysis. This chapter reviews self and mutual inductance and performs calculations
on mutually coupled circuits and describes and uses the dot rule in coupled circuit problems.

43.4 Coupling coefficient

The coupling coefficient k is the degree or fraction of
magnetic coupling that occurs between circuits.

flux linking two circuits

total flux produced

When there is no magnetic coupling, k = 0. If the mag-
netic coupling is perfect, i.e. all the flux produced in
the primary links with the secondary then k = 1. Coup-
ling coefficient is used in communications engineering
to denote the degree of coupling between two coils. If
the coils are close together, most of the flux produced
by current in one coil passes through the other, and the
coils are termed tightly coupled. If the coils are spaced

apart, only a part of the flux links with the second, and
the coils are termed loosely coupled.

43.5 Coils connected in series

Figure 43.2 shows two coils, | and 2, wound on an
insulating core with terminals B and C joined. The
fluxes in each coil produced by current i are in the
same direction and the coils are termed cumulatively
coupled.

Let the self inductance of coil 1 be L; and that of
coil 2 be L2 and let their mutual inductance be M

If in dt seconds, the current increases by di amperes
then the e.m.f. induced in coil | due to its self inductance
is L,(di/dt) volts, and the e.m.f. induced in coil 2 due
to its self inductance is Ly(di/dt) volts. Also, the e.m.f.
induced in coil 1 due to the increase of current in coil 2
is M(di/dt) volts and the e.m.f. induced in coil 2 due to
the increase of current in coil 1 is M(di/dt)

Hence the total e.m.f. induced in coils | and 2 is:

If the winding between terminals A and D in Figure 43.2
are considered as a single circuit having a self induc-

is di amperes then the e.m.f. induced in the complete
circuit is L4(di/dt) volts.

If terminals B and D are joined as shown in Figure 43.3
the direction of the current in coil 2 is reversed and the
coils are termed differentially coupled. In this case, the
total e.m.f. induced in coils 1 and 2 is:

The e.m.f. M (di/dt) induced in coil | due to an increase
di amperes in dt seconds in coil 2 is in the same direc-
tion as the current and is hence in opposition to the
e.m.f. induced in coil 1 due to its self inductance. Simi-
larly, the e.m.f. induced in coil 2 by mutual inductance
is in opposition to that induced by the self inductance
of coil 2.

An experimental method of determining the mutual

the coils both ways and determine the equivalent induc-

inductance is then given by a quarter of the difference
between the two values of inductance.

Problem 5. Two coils connected in series have
self inductance of 40mH and 10 mH, respectively.
The total inductance of the circuit is found to be

Tuning capacitors may be added to the primary and/or
secondary circuits to cause it to resonate at partic-
ular frequencies. These may be connected either in
series or in parallel with the windings. Figure 43.11
shows each winding tuned by series-connected capaci-
tors C; and C2. The expression for the effective primary
impedance Zj(eff), i.e. equation (25), applies except

668 — Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

In these equations the ‘M”’ terms have been written as
+ because it is not possible to state whether the magne-
tomotive forces due to currents J; and Jy are added or
subtracted. To make this clearer a dot notation is used
whereby the polarity of the induced e.m.f. due to mutual
inductance is identified by placing a dot on the diagram
adjacent to that end of each equivalent winding which
bears the same relationship to the magnetic flux.

The dot rule determines the sign of the voltage of
mutual inductance in the Kirchhoff’s law equations
shown above, and states:

(i) when both currents enter, or both currents leave,
a pair of coupled coils at the dotted terminals, the
signs of the ‘M’ terms will be the same as the signs
of the ‘L’ terms, or

(ii) when one current enters at a dotted terminal and
one leaves by a dotted terminal, the signs of the
‘M’ terms are opposite to the signs of the ‘L’ terms.

Thus Figure 43.18 shows two cases in which the signs
of M and L are the same, and Figure 43.19 shows two
cases where the signs of M and L are opposite. In Figure
43.17, therefore, if dots had been placed at the top end of
coils L; and L2 then the terms j@M/Jy and j@MT;, in the

Transmission lines

As the name implies, a transmission line is a set of conductors used for transmitting electrical signals.
Coaxial cable and twisted pair cable are examples. In general, every connection in an electric circuit is
a transmission line. In a simple transmission line, a source provides a signal that must reach a load. In
basic circuit theory, it is assumed that the wires that make up the transmission line are ideal and hence
that the voltage at all points on the wires is exactly the same. In reality, this situation is never quite true.
Any real wire has series resistance, R, and inductance, L. Additionally, a capacitance, C, exists between
any pair of real wires. Moreover, because all dielectrics exhibit some leakage, a small conductance, G, (i.e.
a high shunt resistance) exists between the two wires. Understanding transmission lines is an important
part of the art of radio — the proper selection and use of a feed line is often more important than the
choice of radio. In this chapter the purpose of transmission lines is explained, as are the current and
voltage relationships; calculations involving the characteristic impedance and propagation coefficient,
distortion, wave reflection and standing waves are also explored.

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

e appreciate the purpose of a transmission line

e define the transmission line primary constants R, L, C and G

e calculate phase delay, wavelength and velocity of propagation on a transmission line

e appreciate current and voltage relationships on a transmission line

e define the transmission line secondary line constants Zo, y, a and B

e calculate characteristic impedance and propagation coefficient in terms of the primary line constants

Transmission lines 675

One form of construction often used consists of two
similar conductors mounted close together at a constant
separation. The two conductors form the two sides of
a balanced circuit and any radiation from one of them
is neutralized by that from the other. Such twin-wire
lines are used for carrying high rf. power, for exam-
ple, at transmitters. The coaxial form of construction is
commonly employed for low power use, one conduc-
tor being in the form of a cylinder which surrounds the
other at its centre, and thus acts as a screen. Such cables
are often used to couple f.m. and television receivers to
their antennas.

At frequencies greater than 1000 MHz, transmission
lines are usually in the form of a waveguide which may
be regarded as coaxial lines without the centre con-
ductor, the energy being launched into the guide or
abstracted from it by probes or loops projecting into
the guide.

44.2 Transmission line primary

constants

Let an a.c. generator be connected to the input termi-
nals of a pair of parallel conductors of infinite length.
A sinusoidal wave will move along the line and a finite
current will flow into the line. The variation of voltage
with distance along the line will resemble the varia-
tion of applied voltage with time. The moving wave,
sinusoidal in this case, is called a voltage travelling
wave. As the wave moves along the line the capaci-
tance of the line is charged up and the moving charges
cause magnetic energy to be stored. Thus the propaga-
tion of such an electromagnetic wave constitutes a flow
of energy.

After sufficient time the magnitude of the wave may
be measured at any point along the line. The line does
not therefore appear to the generator as an open cir-
cuit but presents a definite load Zo. If the sending-end
voltage is Vs and the sending-end current is 7s then
Zo=Vs/TIs. Thus all of the energy is absorbed by
the line and the line behaves in a similar manner to
the generator as would a single ‘lumped’ impedance
of value Zo connected directly across the generator
terminals.

There are four parameters associated with transmis-
sion lines, these being resistance, inductance, capaci-
tance and conductance.

(i) Resistance R is given by R=pl/A, where p is
the resistivity of the conductor material, A is the

cross-sectional area of each conductor and / is the
length of the conductor (for a two-wire system, /
represents twice the length of the line). Resistance
is stated in ohms per metre length of a line and
represents the imperfection of the conductor. A
resistance stated in ohms per loop metre is a little
more specific since it takes into consideration the
fact that there are two conductors in a particular
length of line.

(ii) Inductance L is due to the magnetic field sur-
rounding the conductors of a transmission line
when a current flows through them. The induc-
tance of an isolated twin line is considered in
Section 40.7. From equation (23), page 589, the
inductance L is given by

— HOHr
i

L

1 D
— + In— + henry/metre
4 a

where D is the distance between centres of the
conductor and ais the radius of each conductor. In
most practical lines “7, = 1. An inductance stated
in henrys per loop metre takes into consideration
the fact that there are two conductors in a partic-
ular length of line.

(iii) Capacitance C exists as a result of the electric
field between conductors of a transmission line.
The capacitance of an isolated twin line is con-
sidered in Section 40.3. From equation (14), page
581, the capacitance between the two conductors
is given by
7 E0Er

= —— farads/metre
In(D/a)

In most practical lines ¢, = 1

(iv) Conductance G is due to the insulation of the
line allowing some current to leak from one con-
ductor to the other. Conductance is measured in
siemens per metre length of line and represents
the imperfection of the insulation. Another name
for conductance is leakance.

Each of the four transmission line constants, R, L, C
and G, known as the primary constants, are uniformly
distributed along the line.

From Chapter 41, when a symmetrical T-network is ter-
minated in its characteristic impedance Zo, the input
impedance of the network is also equal to Zo. Similarly,
if a number of identical T-sections are connected in cas-
cade, the input impedance of the network will also be
equal to Zo

Figure 44.1

A transmission line can be considered to consist of a
network of a very large number of cascaded T-sections
each a very short length (6/) of transmission line, as
shown in Figure 44.1. This is an approximation of the
uniformly distributed line; the larger the number of
lumped parameter sections, the nearer it approaches the
true distributed nature of the line. When the genera-
tor Vs is connected, a current Js flows which divides
between that flowing through the leakage conductance
G, which is lost, and that which progressively charges
each capacitor C and which sets up the voltage travelling
wave moving along the transmission line. The loss or
attenuation in the line is caused by both the conductance
G and the series resistance R

44.3 Phase delay, wavelength

and velocity of propagation

Each section of that shown in Figure 44.1 is simply
a low-pass filter possessing losses R and G. If losses
are neglected, and R and G are removed, the circuit
simplifies and the infinite line reduces to a repetitive
T-section low-pass filter network, as shown in
Figure 44.2. Let a generator be connected to the line as
shown and let the voltage be rising to a maximum posi-
tive value just at the instant when the line is connected to
it. A current [5 flows through inductance Lj into capac-
itor C,. The capacitor charges and a voltage develops
across it. The voltage sends a current through inductance

L', and L2 into capacitor C2. The capacitor charges and
the voltage developed across it sends a current through
Ly and L3 into C3, and so on. Thus all capacitors will
in turn charge up to the maximum input voltage. When
the generator voltage falls, each capacitor is charged in
turn in opposite polarity, and as before the input charge
is progressively passed along to the next capacitor. In
this manner voltage and current waves travel along the
line together and depend on each other.

The process outlined above takes time; for exam-
ple, by the time capacitor C3 has reached its maximum
voltage, the generator input may be at zero or moving
towards its minimum value. There will therefore be a
time, and thus a phase difference between the generator
input voltage and the voltage at any point on the line.

Phase delay

Since the line shown in Figure 44.2 is a ladder network
of low-pass T-section filters, itis shown in equation (27),
page 645, that the phase delay, /, is given by:

B =./(LC) radians/metre (1)

where L and C are the inductance and capacitance per
metre of the line.

Wavelength

The wavelength 4 on a line is the distance between a
given point and the next point along the line at which
the voltage is the same phase, the initial point leading

phase change of 27 radians occurs, the phase change per
metre is 277//. Hence, phase change per metre, 8 =27//

or wavelength, A = nm metres (2)

Velocity of propagation

The velocity of propagation, u, is given by u= fA,
where f is the frequency and / the wavelength. Hence
2nf w

u=fh=fQnl) == =F (3)

The velocity of propagation of free space is the same

as that of light, ie. approximately 300 x 10° m/s. The

velocity of electrical energy along a line is always less

than the velocity in free space. The wavelength 2 of

radiation in free space is given by 4=c/f where c is

the velocity of light. Since the velocity along a line is

always less than c, the wavelength corresponding to any

particular frequency is always shorter on the line than it
would be in free space.

(b) From equation (3), speed of transmission,

Determine, for a frequency of operation of 1 kHz,
(a) the phase delay, (b) the wavelength on the line
and (c) the velocity of propagation (in metres per

(a) From equation (1), phase delay,

= 0.025 rad/km

(b) From equation (2), wavelength 2 = 22/6

(c) From equation (3), velocity of propagation,

u = fA = (1000)(251) km/s = 251 x 10° m/s

44.4 Current and voltage

relationships

Figure 44.3 shows a voltage source Vs applied to the
input terminals of an infinite line, or a line terminated in
its characteristic impedance, such that a current Js flows
into the line. At a point, say, 1 km down the line, let
the current be /;. The current J; will not have the same
magnitude as Is because of line attenuation; also 7, will
lag Is by some angle f. The ratio /s/J; is therefore a
phasor quantity. Let the current a further | km down the
line be J, and so on, as shown in Figure 44.3. Each unit
length of line can be treated as a section of a repetitive
network, as explained in Section 44.2. The attenuation

The propagation constant is a complex quantity given
by y =a+ Jf, where a is the attenuation constant,
whose unit is the neper, and f is the phase shift coeffi-
cient, whose unit is the radian. For n such 1 km sections,

Hence a = e+ JB) = (na + inB) — eh /np

from which, Ip =Jse—"” =Ise-"*Z—nB (4)

In equation (4), the attenuation on the line is given by
na. nepers and the phase shift is nf radians.

At all points along an infinite line, the ratio of voltage
to current is Zo, the characteristic impedance. Thus from
equation (4) it follows that:

receiving end voltage,
Vr =Vse"” = Vse""* Z—nB (5)

Zo, y, @, and f are referred to as the secondary line
constants or coefficients.

Problem 3. When operating at a frequency of

2 kHz, a cable has an attenuation of 0.25 Np/km and
a phase shift of 0.20 rad/km. If a 5 V r.m.s. signal is
applied at the sending end, determine the voltage at
a point 10 km down the line, assuming that the
termination is equal to the characteristic impedance
of the line.

Let Vr be the voltage at a point n km from the sending
end, then from equation (5),
Vr=Vse—"? = Vse"* Z—nB
Since a=0.25 Np/km, 6=0.20rad/km, Vs =5 V and
n= 10km, then
Vr = (5)e~ 125) 7 _ (10) (0.20) = Se? Z—-2.0 V

Thus the voltage 10km down the line is 0.41 V rms.
lagging the sending end voltage of 5 V by 2.0 rad or
114.6°

Problem 4. A transmission line 5 km long has a
characteristic impedance of 8007—25°Q. Ata
particular frequency, the attenuation coefficient of
the line is 0.5 Np/km and the phase shift coefficient
is 0.25 rad/km. Determine the magnitude and phase
of the current at the receiving end, if the sending
end voltage is 2.020° V r.m.s.

Problem 5. The voltages at the input and at the
output of a transmission line properly terminated in
its characteristic impedance are 8.0 V and 2.0 V

the length of the line is doubled.

The receiving-end voltage Vr is given by Ve =Vse””.

Hence 2.0=8.0e~”” , from which,

If the line is doubled in length, then

44.5 Characteristic impedance and

propagation coefficient in terms
of the primary constants

Characteristic impedance

At all points along an infinite line, the ratio of voltage to
current is called the characteristic impedance Zp. The
value of Zo is independent of the length of the line; it
merely describes a property of a line that is a function of
the physical construction of the line. Since a short length
of line may be considered as a ladder of identical low-
pass filter sections, the characteristic impedance may be
determined from equation (2), page 595, i.e.

Zo = /(ZocZsc) (6)

since the open-circuit impedance Zoc and the short-
circuit impedance Zsc may be easily measured.

Problem 6. Ata frequency of 1.5 kHz the
open-circuit impedance of a length of transmission
line is 8007—50° Q and the short-circuit impedance
is 413 Z—20°Q. Determine the characteristic
impedance of the line at this frequency.

From equation (6), characteristic impedance

Zo = J/(ZocZsc)
= /{(800Z—50°)(413Z—20°)]

= ./(3304002—70°) = 5752-35° Q
by de Moivre’s theorem.

The characteristic impedance of a transmission line may
also be expressed in terms of the primary constants, R,
L, G and C. Measurements of the primary constants
may be obtained for a particular line and manufacturers
usually state them for a standard length.

Let a very short length of line 6/ metres be as shown
in Figure 44.4, comprising a single T-section. Each
series arm impedance is Z1 =3(R + jwL)dél ohms, and
the shunt arm impedance is

44.6 Distortion on transmission lines

If the waveform at the receiving end of a transmis-
sion line is not the same shape as the waveform at the
sending end, distortion is said to have occurred. The
three main causes of distortion on transmission lines
are as follows.

(i) The characteristic impedance Zp of a line
varies with the operating frequency, i.e. from
equation (7),

R+ joL
Zo= AF JO" ohms
G+ joC

The terminating impedance of the line may not
vary with frequency in the same manner.

In the above equation for Zo, if the frequency
is very low, w is low and Zo ./(R/G). If the
frequency is very high, then oL > R, oC >>G
and Zo ¥ /(L/C). A graph showing the variation
of Zo with frequency f is shown in Figure 44.7.

(a)

v(e)

G

Figure 44.7

If the characteristic impedance is to be con-
stant throughout the entire operating frequency
range then the following condition is required:


684 — Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

J (LIC) = /(R/G), i.e L/C = R/G, from which
LG=CR (12)

Thus, in a transmission line, if LG=CR it is
possible to provide a termination equal to the
characteristic impedance Zo at all frequencies.

(ii) The attenuation of a line varies with the operating
frequency (since y =./[(R+ jaL)(G+ joC)],
from equation (10)), thus waves of differing fre-
quencies and component frequencies of complex
waves are attenuated by different amounts.

From the above equation for the propagation
coefficient:

y? =(R+ joL)(G + joC)
= RG+ jo(LG + CR) — @LC
If LG=CR=x, then LG+CR=2x and LG+CR
may be written as 2,/x*, ic. LG+CR may be

written as 2,/[(LG)(CR)]
Thus y? = RG + ja(2./[(LG)(CR)]) —@LC

=[V(RG) + joV(LOP
andy = (RG) + jov(LC)
Since y =a+ jf,
attenuation coefficient, « = \/(RG) (13)

and phase-shift coefficient, 6 =@/(LC) (14)

Thus, in a transmission line, if LG=CR,
a= /(RG), i.e. the attenuation coefficient is
independent of frequency and all frequencies are
equally attenuated.

(iii) The delay time, or the time of propagation, and
thus the velocity of propagation, varies with
frequency and therefore waves of different fre-
quencies arrive at the termination with differing
delays. From equation (14), the phase-shift
coefficient, 8 =w./(LC) when LG=CR

@ @
Velocity of propagation, u = — = ————
B w/(LC)
. 1 (15)
1.¢e. u= ——
VLO)

Thus, in a transmission line, if LG=CR, the
velocity of propagation, and hence the time
delay, is independent of frequency.

From the above it appears that the condition LG=CR
is appropriate for the design of a transmission line,
since under this condition no distortion is introduced.
This means that the signal at the receiving end is the
same as the sending-end signal except that it is reduced
in amplitude and delayed by a fixed time. Also, with
no distortion, the attenuation on the line is a minimum.
In practice, however, R/L>>G/C. The inductance
is usually low and the capacitance is large and not
easily reduced. Thus if the condition LG=CR is to be
achieved in practice, either L or G must be increased
since neither CN or R can really be altered. It is unde-
sirable to increase G since the attenuation and power
losses increase. Thus the inductance L is the quantity
that needs to be increased and such an artificial increase
in the line inductance is called loading. This is achieved
either by inserting inductance coils at intervals along the
transmission line — this being called ‘lumped loading’ —
or by wrapping the conductors with a high-permeability
metal tape — this being called ‘continuous loading’.

Problem 11. An underground cable has the
following primary constants: resistance
R=10Q/loop km, inductance L = 1.5mH/loop km,
conductance G= 1.2 wS/km and capacitance
C=0.061F/km. Determine by how much the
inductance should be increased to satisfy the
condition for minimum distortion.

From equation (12), the condition for minimum distor-
tion is given by LG=CR, from which,

CR (0.06 x 10~°)(10)
G— 1.2x 10-6

inductance L =
= 0.5 H or 500 mH.

Thus the inductance should be increased by
(500 —1.5)mH, ic. 498.5mH per loop km, for
minimum distortion.

Problem 12. A cable has the following primary
constants: resistance R = 80 Q/loop km,
conductance, G=2\S/km and capacitance

C =5nF/km. Determine, for minimum distortion at
a frequency of 1.5 kHz (a) the value of inductance
per loop kilometre required, (b) the propagation
coefficient, (c) the velocity of propagation of signal
and (d) the wavelength on the line.

ficient, (c) the speed of signal transmission and

44.7 Wave reflection and

the reflection coefficient

In earlier sections of this chapter it was assumed that
the transmission line had been properly terminated in its
characteristic impedance or regarded as an infinite line.
In practice, of course, all lines have a definite length and
often the terminating impedance does not have the same
value as the characteristic impedance of the line. When
this is the case, the transmission line is said to have a
‘mismatched load’.

The forward-travelling wave moving from the source
to the load is called the incident wave or the sending-
end wave. With a mismatched load the termination will
absorb only a part of the energy of the incident wave,
the remainder being forced to return back along the
line toward the source. This latter wave is called the
reflected wave.

Electrical energy is transmitted by a transmission
line; when such energy arrives at a termination that has
a value different from the characteristic impedance, it
experiences a sudden change in the impedance of the
medium. When this occurs, some reflection of incident
energy occurs and the reflected energy is lost to the
receiving load. (Reflections commonly occur in nature
when a change of transmission medium occurs; for
example, sound waves are reflected at a wall, which can
produce echoes, and light rays are reflected by mirrors.)

If a transmission line is terminated in its character-
istic impedance, no reflection occurs; if terminated in
an open circuit or a short circuit, total reflection occurs,
i.e. the whole of the incident wave reflects along the
line. Between these extreme possibilities, all degrees of
reflection are possible.

Open-circuited termination

If a length of transmission line is open-circuited at the
termination, no current can flow in it and thus no power
can be absorbed by the termination. This condition is
achieved if a current is imagined to be reflected from
the termination, the reflected current having the same
magnitude as the incident wave but with a phase differ-
ence of 180°. Also, since no power is absorbed at the
termination (it is all returned back along the line), the
reflected voltage wave at the termination must be equal
to the incident wave. Thus the voltage at the termina-
tion must be doubled by the open circuit. The resultant
current (and voltage) at any point on the transmission
line and at any instant of time is given by the sum of the
currents (and voltages) due to the incident and reflected
waves (see Section 44.8).


686 Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology

Short-circuit termination

If the termination of a transmission line is short-
circuited, the impedance is zero, and hence the voltage
developed across it must be zero. As with the open-
circuit condition, no power is absorbed by the termi-
nation. To obtain zero voltage at the termination, the
reflected voltage wave must be equal in amplitude but
opposite in phase (i.e. 180° phase difference) to the inci-
dent wave. Since no power is absorbed, the reflected
current wave at the termination must be equal to the
incident current wave and thus the current at the end of
the line must be doubled at the short circuit. As with the
open-circuited case, the resultant voltage (and current)
at any point on the line and at any instant of time is
given by the sum of the voltages (and currents) due to
the incident and reflected waves.

Energy associated with a travelling wave

A travelling wave on a transmission line may be
thought of as being made up of electric and magnetic
components. Energy is stored in the magnetic field
due to the current (energy = 5LI  _ see page 591) and
energy is stored in the electric field due to the volt-
age (energy = 5 CV? — see page 583). It is the continual
interchange of energy between the magnetic and elec-
tric fields, and vice versa, that causes the transmission of
the total electromagnetic energy along the transmission
line.

When a wave reaches an open-circuited termination
the magnetic field collapses since the current J is zero.
Energy cannot be lost, but it can change form. In this
case it is converted into electrical energy, adding to that
already caused by the existing electric field. The volt-
age at the termination consequently doubles and this
increased voltage starts the movement of a reflected
wave back along the line. A magnetic field will be set up
by this movement and the total energy of the reflected
wave will again be shared between the magnetic and
electric field components.

When a wave meets a short-circuited termination, the
electric field collapses and its energy changes form to
the magnetic energy. This results in a doubling of the
current.

Reflection coefficient

Let a generator having impedance Zo (this being equal to
the characteristic impedance of the line) be connected
to the input terminals of a transmission line which is
terminated in an impedance Zr, where Zo 4 Zp, as
shown in Figure 44.8. The sending-end or incident cur-
rent J; flowing from the source generator flows along the

line and, until it arrives at the termination Zr, behaves
as though the line were infinitely long or properly
terminated in its characteristic impedance, Zo

The ratio of the reflected current to the incident current

symbol p, i.e.

Thus the ratio of the reflected to the incident voltage has
the same magnitude as the ratio of reflected to incident
current, but is of opposite sign. From equations (16) and
(17) it is seen that when Zr = Zo, p =0 and there is no
reflection.

Figure 44.10 Current waveforms on an open-circuited trans-
mission line

The resultant of the two waves is obtained by adding
them at intervals. In this case the resultant is seen
to be zero. Figures 44.10(b) and (c) show the inci-
dent and reflected waves drawn separately as times
t=T/8 seconds and t=T7/4, where T is the periodic
time of the signal. Again, the resultant is obtained by
adding the incident and reflected waveforms at inter-
vals. Figures 44.10(d) to (h) show the incident and
reflected current waveforms plotted on the same axis,
together with their resultant waveform, at times t = 37/8
to t=7T/8 at intervals of T/8

If the resultant waveforms shown in Figures 44.10(a)
to (g) are superimposed one upon the other, Figure 44.11
results. (Note that the scale has been increased for clar-
ity.) The waveforms show clearly that waveform (a)
moves to (b) after 7/8, then to (c) after a further period
of 7/8, then to (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) at intervals of 7/8.
It is noted that at any particular point the current varies
sinusoidally with time, but the amplitude of oscillation
is different at different points on the line.

Whenever two waves of the same frequency and
amplitude travelling in opposite directions are super-
imposed on each other as above, interference takes
place between the two waves and a standing or sta-
tionary wave is produced. The points at which the
current is always zero are called nodes (labelled N in
Figure 44.11). The standing wave does not progress to
the left or right and the nodes do not oscillate. Those
points on the wave that undergo maximum disturbance
are called antinodes (labelled A in Figure 44.11). The
distance between adjacent nodes or adjacent antinodes
is 4/2, where A is the wavelength. A standing wave is
therefore seen to be a periodic variation in the verti-
cal plane taking place on the transmission line without
travel in either direction.

The resultant of the incident and reflected volt-
age for the open-circuit termination may be deduced
in a similar manner to that for current. However, as
stated in Section 44.7, when the incident voltage wave
reaches the termination it is reflected without phase
change. Figure 44.12 shows the resultant waveforms of
incident and reflected voltages at intervals of t=T/8.
Figure 44.13 shows all the resultant waveforms of
Figure 44.12(a) to (h) superimposed; again, standing
waves are seen to result. Nodes (labelled NV) and antin-
odes (labelled A) are shown in Figure 44.13 and, in
comparison with the current waves, are seen to occur
90° out of phase.

If the transmission line is short-circuited at the
termination, it is the incident current that is reflected
without phase change and the incident voltage that is

of the waveforms shown in Figures 44.11 and 44.13,
except that they are each divided by ./2 (since, for
a sine wave, t.m.s. value= (1//2) x maximum value).
With total reflection, the standing-wave patterns of r.m.s.
voltage and current consist of a succession of positive
sine waves with the voltage node located at the cur-
rent antinode and the current node located at the voltage
antinode. The termination is a current nodal point. The
rm.s. values of current and voltage may be recorded on
a suitable r.m.s. instrument moving along the line. Such
measurements of the maximum and minimum voltage
and current can provide a reasonably accurate indica-
tion of the wavelength, and also provide information
regarding the amount of reflected energy relative to the
incident energy that is absorbed at the termination, as
shown below.

Standing-wave ratio

Let the incident current flowing from the source of a
mismatched low-loss transmission line be J; and the
current reflected at the termination be J/,. If Jyax is the
sum of the incident and reflected current, and [yn is
their difference, then the standing-wave ratio (symbol
s) on the line is defined as:

Thus the ratio of the reflected to the transmitted power
may be calculated directly from the standing-wave ratio,
which may be calculated from measurements of Max
and Jin. When a transmission line is properly ter-
minated there is no reflection, i.e. J-=0, and from
equation (19) the standing-wave ratio is 1. From equa-
tion (21), when s=1, P, =O, i.e. there is no reflected
power. In practice, the standing-wave ratio is kept as
close to unity as possible. From equation (16), the reflec-

Transients and Laplace
transforms

A transient state will exist in a circuit containing one or more energy storage elements (i.e. capacitors
and inductors) whenever the energy conditions in the circuit change, until the new steady state condition
is reached. Transients are caused by changing the applied voltage or current, or by changing any of the
circuit elements; such changes occur due to opening and closing switches. In this chapter, such equations
are developed analytically by using both differential equations and Laplace transforms for different
waveform supply voltages. The solution of most electrical problems can be reduced ultimately to the
solution of differential equations and the use of Laplace transforms provides an alternative method to
those used previously. Laplace transforms provide a convenient method for the calculation of the complete
response of a circuit. In this chapter, the technique of Laplace transforms is developed and then used
to solve differential equations; in addition, Laplace transforms are used to analyse transient responses
directly from circuit diagrams

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:

e determine the transient response of currents and voltages in R-L, R-C and L—R-C series circuits using
differential equations

e define the Laplace transform of a function

e use a table of Laplace transforms of functions commonly met in electrical engineering for transient analysis
of simple networks

e use partial fractions to deduce inverse Laplace transforms

e deduce expressions for component and circuit impedances in the s-plane given initial conditions

e use Laplace transform analysis directly from circuit diagrams in the s-plane

e deduce Kirchhoff’s law equations in the s-plane for determining the response of R-L, R-C and L—R-C
networks, given initial conditions

e explain the conditions for which an L—R-C circuit response is over, critical, under or zero-damped and
calculate circuit responses

e predict the circuit response of an L—R-C network, given non-zero initial conditions

45.1 Introduction

A transient state will exist in a circuit containing one
or more energy storage elements (i.e. capacitors and
inductors) whenever the energy conditions in the cir-
cuit change, until the new steady state condition is
reached. Transients are caused by changing the applied
voltage or current, or by changing any of the circuit
elements; such changes occur due to opening and clos-
ing switches. Transients were introduced in Chapter 17
where growth and decay curves were constructed and
their equations stated for step inputs only. In this chap-
ter, such equations are developed analytically by using
both differential equations and Laplace transforms
for different waveform supply voltages.

ie. Ae” (m?LC +mRC + 1) =0

Thus vc=Ae”™ is a solution of the given equation
provided that

m°LC +mRC +1=0 (23)
This is called the auxiliary equation.

Using the quadratic formula on equation (23) gives:

This equation may have either:

(i) two different real roots, when (R/2L)?>
(1/LC), when the circuit is said to be overdamped
since the transient voltage decays very slowly
with time, or

(ii) two real equal roots, when (R/2L)* =(1/LC),
when the circuit is said to be critically damped
since the transient voltage decays in the minimum
amount of time without oscillations occurring, or

(iii) two complex roots, when (R/2L)* < (1/LC),
when the circuit is said to be underdamped
since the transient voltage oscillates about the
final steady state value, the oscillations eventually
dying away to give the steady state value, or

(iv) if R=0 in equation (24), the oscillations would
continue indefinitely without any reduction in
amplitude — this is the undamped condition.

Damping is discussed again in Section 45.8 with typical
current responses sketched in Figure 45.30 on page 723.

45.5 Introduction to Laplace

transforms

The solution of most electrical problems can be reduced
ultimately to the solution of differential equations, and
the use of Laplace* transforms provides an alternative
method to those used previously. Laplace transforms
provide a convenient method for the calculation of the
complete response of a circuit. In this section and in
Section 45.5 the technique of Laplace transforms is
developed and then used to solve differential equations.
In Section 45.7 Laplace transforms are used to analyse
transient responses directly from circuit diagrams.

Definition of a Laplace transform

The Laplace transform of the function of time f(t) is
defined by the integral

[o,@)
i e “‘f(t)dt where s is a parameter
0

*Who was Laplace? Go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

There are various commonly used notations for the
Laplace transform of f(t) and these include /{ f(t)}
or L{ f(t)} or Z(f) or Lf or f(s).

Also the letter p is sometimes used instead of s as
the parameter. The notation used in this chapter will
be f(t) for the original function and /{ f(t)} for its
Laplace transform,

ie. 2irt)= | e p(nydt (32)

Laplace transforms of the following waveforms:

(b) astep voltage of 10 V which starts at
time f=5s

(c) aramp voltage which starts at zero and
increases at 4 V/s

(d) aramp voltage which starts at time t= 1s and
increases at 4 V/s

(a) From 2 of Table 45.1,

L410} = 10.L{1} = 10 (;) = *

The waveform is shown in Figure 45.12(a).

Figure 45.12

(b) From4 of Table 45.1, astep function of 10 V which
is delayed by t=5s is given by:

This is, in fact, the function starting at t=O given
in part (a), i.e. (10/s) multiplied by e~*7 , where T
is the delay in seconds.

The waveform is shown in Figure 45.12(b).

(c) From 7 of Table 45.1, the Laplace transform of the
unit ramp, Y{t} = (1/s2).

Hence the Laplace transform of a ramp voltage
increasing at 4 V/s is given by:

AZ = 5

The waveform is shown in Figure 45.12(c).

(d) As with part (b), for a delayed function, the
Laplace transform is the undelayed function, in
this case (4/s*) from part (c), multiplied by e~*”
where JT in this case is 1s. Hence the Laplace
transform is given by:

The waveform is shown in Figure 45.12(d).

Problem 11. Determine the Laplace transforms
of the following waveforms:

(a) an impulse voltage of 8 V which starts at time

t=0
(b) an impulse voltage of 8 V which starts at time
t=2s

(c) asinusoidal current of 4A and angular
frequency 5 rad/s which starts at time t =0

(a) Animpulse is an intense signal of very short dura-
tion. This function is often known as the Dirac*
function.

From | of Table 45.1, the Laplace transform of an
impulse starting at time t =O is given by 2{6}=1,
hence an impulse of 8 V is given by: 8.2{d}=8

This is shown in Figure 45.13(a).

(b) From part (a) the Laplace transform of an impulse
of 8V is 8. Delaying the impulse by 2s involves
multiplying the undelayed function by e~*? where
T=2s.

Hence the Laplace transform of the function is
given by: 8e~

Equations (33) and (34) are used in the solution of
differential equations in Section 45.5.

The initial and final value theorems

The initial and final value theorems can often consider-
ably reduce the work of solving electrical circuits.

(a) The initial value theorem states:
limit f()] = limit [s.-21 f()}]
Thus, for example, if
f(t) =v = Ve" and if, say,
V = 10 and CR=0.5, then
f(t) =v =10e-~

s+2
from 3 of Table 45.1

s Lf ()} = 10 Ea

From the initial value theorem, the initial value of
f(t) is given by:

10.)
10] | = 10(1) =10

(b) The final value theorem states:
limit [ f (¢)]= limit[s7{f(O}]
t>oo s>0

In the above example of f(t)=10e~*' the final
value is given by:

1o[ 505 |=°
0+2

The initial and final value theorems are used in pulse
circuit applications where the response of the circuit
for small periods of time, or the behaviour immediately
after the switch is closed, are of interest. The final value
theorem is particularly useful in investigating the sta-
bility of systems (such as in automatic aircraft-landing
systems) and is concerned with the steady state response
for large values of time f, i.e. after all transient effects
have died away.

Use of partial fractions for inverse Laplace
transforms

Sometimes the function whose inverse is required is not
recognizable as a standard type, such as those listed in
Table 45.1. In such cases it may be possible, by using
partial fractions, to resolve the function into simpler
fractions which may be inverted on sight.

For example, the function F(s)= cannot be

s—3
s(s—3)
inverted on sight from Table 45.1. However, using
partial fractions:

2s—3 _A B
s(s—3) s s—3

from which, 2s —-3=A(s —3)+ Bs

_ A(s—3)+ Bs
s(s — 3)

Letting s=0 gives: -3=—3A from which A= 1

Letting s=3 gives: 3=3B from which B= 1

2s —3 1 1
-1 -1
Thus 7 F |=2 {-+—+5)|

=1+e* from 2 and 3 of
Table 45.1

Partial fractions are explained in Engineering Math-

Procedure to solve differential equations by
using Laplace transforms

(i) Take the Laplace transform of both sides of the
differential equation by applying the formulae for
the Laplace transforms of derivatives (i.e. equa-
tions (33) and (34) on page 705) and, where nec-
essary, using a list of standard Laplace transforms,
such as Table 45.1 on page 703.

(ii) Put in the given initial conditions, i.e. y(O) and
y'(0)
(iii) Rearrange the equation to make /{y} the subject.

(iv) Determine y by using, where necessary, partial
fractions, and taking the inverse of each term by
using Table 45.1.

This procedure is demonstrated in the following

problems.

Resistor
At any instant in time v = Ri

Since v andi are both functions of time, a more correct
equation would be v(t) = Ri(t)

However, this is normally assumed. The Laplace
transform of this equation is:

V(s) = RI(s)

Vs) _p
I(s)

(Note that V(s) merely means that it is the Laplace
transform of v and /(s) is the Laplace transform of i.
Whenever the Laplace transform of functions is taken
it is referred to as the ‘s-domain’ — as opposed to the
‘time domain’.)

The resistor is shown in Figure 45.14 in both the time
domain and the s-domain.

Hence, in the s-domain R(s) =

Inductor

If an inductor has no initial current, i.e. i =O at time
t=O, the normal equation is v = L(di/dt) where L is
the inductance.

The Laplace transform of the equation is:
V(s)=L[sI(s) —i(0)] from equation (33)

and as i(0)=0 then V(s)=sLI(s)
Thus the impedance of the inductor in the s-domain is
given by:

Capacitor

If a capacitor has no initial voltage, i.e. ov =O at time
t =0, the normal equation is i = C(dv/df).
The Laplace transform of the equation is:
I(s) = C[sV(s) — v(0)]
= sCV(s) since v(0) =0

Thus the impedance of the capacitor in the s-domain is
given by:

V(s) V(s) 1

Figure 45.16

Summarizing, in the time domain, the circuit elements
are R, L and C and in the s-domain, the circuit elements
are R, sL and (1/sC).

Note that the impedance of L is X,=jw@L and the
impedance of C is X,=(—j/@C)=(1/jaC).

Thus, just replacing j@ with s gives the s-domain
expressions for L and C. (Because of this apparent
association with j, s is sometimes called the com-
plex frequency and the s-domain called the complex
frequency domain.)

The impedance of the resistor in the s-domain is 200 Q

The impedance of the inductor in the s-domain is

Since the components are in series,

a 5 mH inductor and a 0.04 wF capacitor.

Kirchhoff’s laws in the s-domain

Kirchhoff’s* current and voltage laws may be applied
to currents and voltages in the s-domain just as they
can with normal time domain currents and voltages. To
solve circuits in the s-domain using Kirchhoff’s laws
the procedure is:

(i) change the time domain circuit to an s-domain

circuit,

(ii) apply Kirchhoff’s laws in terms of s,

(iii) solve the equation to obtain the Laplace trans-
form of the unknown quantity and

(iv) determine the inverse Laplace transform after
rearranging into a form that can be recognized
in a table of standard transforms.

cient, (e) the wavelength on the line and (f) the
speed of transmission of signal. (13)

tic impedance of 6002Z0°Q and is connected to
an aerial of impedance (250 + 7200) Q. Determine
(a) the magnitude of the ratio of the reflected to the
incident voltage wave and (b) the incident voltage
if the reflected voltage is 10260° V. (5)

such that the reflection coefficient at the termination
is 0.5Z—150°. The characteristic impedance of the
line is 200 Q. Determine (a) the standing wave ratio,
(b) the load impedance and (c) the incident current
flowing if the reflected current is 15 mA. (di1)

Determine, in the s-domain, the impedance of
(a) an inductance of 1 mH, a resistance of 100Q
and a capacitance of 2 ~F connected in series, and
(b) a 50Q resistance in parallel with an inductance
of 5 mH. (6)

Brown 1 10 +1%

Orange 3 10° -

Green 5 105 +0.5%

Violet 7 107 +0.1%

White 9 10° -

Thus, for a five-band fixed resistor (i.e. resistance
values with two significant figures):

yellow-violet-orange-red indicates 47kQ with a toler-
ance of +2%

orange-orange-silver-brown indicates 0.33Q with a
tolerance of +1%

and brown-black-brown indicates 100 Q with a toler-
ance of +20%

(Note that the first band is the one nearest the end of the
resistor).

For a five-band fixed resistor (i.e. resistance values
with three significant figures):

red-yellow-white-orange-brown indicates 249kO with
a tolerance of +1%

(Note that the fifth band is 1.5 to 2 times wider than the
other bands).
