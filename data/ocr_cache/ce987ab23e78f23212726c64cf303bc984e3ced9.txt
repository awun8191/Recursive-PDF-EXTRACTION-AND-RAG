11.1 INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS

Crystallization is employed heavily as a separation process in the inorganic chemical industry, particularly
where salts are recovered from aqueous media. In production of organic chemicals, crystallization is also
used to recover product, to refine intermediate chemicals and to remove undesired salts. The feed to a
crystallization system consists of a solution from which solute is crystallized (or precipitated) via one or
more of a variety of processes. The solids are normally separated from the crystallizer liquid, washed, and
discharged to downstream equipment for additional treatment. High recovery of refined solute is generally
the desired design objective, although sometimes the crystalline product is a residue.

The process of forming a solid phase from solution is termed crystallization, and the operation occurs
in a vessel called a crystallizer. A crystallizer provides residence time for the process streams to approach
equilibrium, possibly a capability of selectively removing fines or coarse product, a mixing or contacting
regime to give uniform crystal growth, and may include provision for addition or removal of heat.

Crystallization is distinguished from other unit operations in that a solid phase is generated. The solid
phase is characterized in part by its inherent shape (habit) and size distribution. The natural habit of the
solid phase is important since it influences product purity, yield, and capacity of the crystallizer system.

11.1-1 Advantages and Disadvantages
Crystallization offers the following advantages:

1, Pure product (solute) can be recovered in one separation stage. With care in design, product purity
greater than 99.0% can be attained in a single stage of crystallization, separation, and washing.

2. A solid phase is formed that is subdivided into discrete particles. Generally, conditions are controlled
so that the crystals have the desired physical form for direct packaging and sale.

The major disadvantages of crystallization are:

1. Purification of more than one component is not normally attainable in one stage.

Crystallization Operations 579

2. The phase behavior of crystallizing systems prohibits full solute recovery in one stage; thus, the
use of additional equipment to remove solute completely from the remaining crystallizer solution

is necessary.

Since crystallization involves processing and handling of a solid phase, the operation is normally applied
when no alternative separation technique is discernible. The choice of crystallization over, say, distillation
as the preferred separation technique may hinge on one or more of the following considerations:

1. Solute is heat sensitive and/or a high boiler and decomposes at temperatures required to conduct
distillation.

2. Low or nil relative volatility exists between solute and contaminants and/or azeotropes formed
between solute and contaminants.

3. Solute (product) is desired in particulate form. For example, if solute can be purified via distillation
then it must be solidified subsequently by flaking or prilling and crystallization may be a more
convenient scheme to employ in such cases.

4. Comparative economics favor crystallization. If distillation requires high temperatures and energy
usage, crystallization may offer economic incentives.

Crystallization is frequently the initial step in a solids processing sequence, similar to that shown in
Fig. 11.1-1, that subsequently includes solid-liquid separation and drying equipment. Since product size

and suspended solids concentration are controlled, to a large extent, in the crystallizer, predictable and
reliable crystallizer performance is essential for smooth operation of the downstream system.

11.1-2 Crystallization Terminology

Binary eutectic. The location on the phase diagram at which simultaneous crystallization of solvent and
solute occurs.

Brodie purifier. A specific type of continuous melt crystallizer.

Crystal habit. The external crystal shape that results from different rates of growth of the various crystal
faces.

Crystallization kinetics. Expressions that describe crystal growth and nucleation rates from solution.

CSD. Crystal size distribution.

Desupersaturation time. The average time that solution in a crystallizer vessel has to deposit solute
before entering the zone where supersaturation is created.

Draft tube. A device inserted in a crystallizer to induce a uniform axial flow pattern inside a crystallizer.

Drawdown time. The time to empty the contents of a crystallizer if the feed is stopped and product is
removed at the normal rate.

DTB. Draft tube baffle—a crystallizer that contains a draft tube and an internal baffle to provide a crystal
settling zone.

Elutriation leg. A settling leg in a crystallizer that classifies and washes the crystals leaving the vessel
by addition of upflow liquid (usually the feed).

Fines removal system. System designed to increase particle size by preferential removal and subsequent
destruction of smaller-size crystals.

Forced circulation crystallization. Continuous crystallizer in which agitation inside the vessel is created
by external circulation of large quantities of liquid through a heater or cooler.

Heterogeneous nucleation. Nucleation induced by foreign matter in a supersaturated liquid.

Homogeneous nucleation. Spontaneous nucleation caused by supersaturation only.

ICT. Initial crystallization temperature.

Labile zone. Zone on concentration~temperature diagram in which spontaneous homogeneous or heter-
ogeneous nucleation of the solid phase will occur.

Metastable zone. Zone on concentration-temperature diagram in which homogeneous or heterogeneous
nucleation will not immediately occur but in which crystal growth will occur.

MSMPR. Mixed-suspension mixed-product removal crystallizer.

Population density. A number density function frequently described as number of crystals per unit volume
of clear liquor (or slurry) per size increment (number/cm?- pm).

Product classification. Classification device that removes large product crystals and returns smaller crys-
tals to the crystallizer.

Secondary nucleation. Nucleation of a supersaturated liquid caused directly or indirectly by the presence
of crystals of the same species as the solute.

Solid solution. Mixed crystals formed when isomorphous substances crystallize together out of a solution.

Supersaturation. The departure from solution saturation usually caused by cooling of the mixture and/
or by evaporating solvent.

Understanding the concept of supersaturation is necessary when discussing crystallization rate processes.
Most liquids sustain a certain level of subcooling depending on the rate of cooling, temperature, and degree
of agitation. Often a clear solution can be slowly subcooled several degrees below its equilibrium temper-
ature before a profusion of nuclei appear. A diagram describing this phenomena is shown in Fig. 11.1-2.
Feed A is cooled to temperature Tp. Thus, feed is subcooled by (Tg — Tp) degrees or has (Tz — Tp)
degrees of supersaturation. The temperature where nuclei first appear (7), defines the metastable limit.
Inside the temperature range from T;- to Tg crystals grow, but spontaneous nucleation will not occur
immediately. In the labile zone (temperatures less than T,) crystal growth and secondary nuclei formation
occur simultaneously, and both rate processes are competing for available solute. Crystallizers are designed
most commonly to control supersaturation at low levels to minimize nucleation, especially by homogeneous
or heterogeneous mechanisms.

11.2. FUNDAMENTALS

Final design of a crystallizer is the culmination of the design strategy depicted in Fig. 11.2-1. In the

generated) are surveyed. Solvent choice and processing conditions are determined in this step. The type of
crystallizer and finally the crystallizer functional design, that is, external and internal construction details,
are then established. The discussion in this section is concemed primarily with generation, interpretation,
and use of solid-liquid equilibrium data and the selection of operating mode.

11.2-1 Equilibria

Accurate solid-liquid equilibrium data must be obtained to evaluate the process design options for crys-
tallization processes. These data are required in the earliest stages of the conceptual design phase and are
necessary for the following reasons:

1. Screening the feasibility of the potential process; that is, determining if pure solute can in fact be
crystallized from the feed solution.

2. Determining the best solvent to use in the process if solution crystallization is employed.

3. Establishing the temperature and/or pressure ranges of the crystallizer operation and the composition
of the residue liquor exiting the crystallizer.

4. Determining the maximum recovery of solute possible. The feed composition and position of the
eutectic fix the maximum attainable solute recovery. Practical limitations such as temperature of
cooling medium, slurry concentration that can be pumped, or impurity level that can be tolerated
may restrict solute recovery.

Phase diagrams occur in many forms. A common type of diagram is the binary eutectic in which a
pure solid component is formed by cooling an unsaturated solution until solids appear. Continued cooling
will increase the yield of pure component. At the eutectic temperature both components solidify and
additional purification is not normally possible. A typical eutectic-forming system (naphthalene-benzene)
is shown in Fig. 11.2-2:

If mixture X is cooled, crystals of benzene will form.
If mixture Y is cooled, naphthalene crystals will! result.

Point Z indicates the position of the binary eutectic. Solid mixtures are formed at temperatures below
this point.

A few binary systems when cooled do not deposit one of the components in a totally pure state. Instead,
behavior resembles that of many vapor-liquid systems and the solid is a true solution. Figure 11.2-3 depicts

of naphthalene and 2-naphthol of composition X is cooled, a mixed crystal of composition Y is formed
rather than a solid containing pure 2-naphthol. This type of behavior is found in only a small fraction of
crystallizing systems.

Figure 11.2-4 shows typical solubility diagrams for solutions of various salts in water. The curve for
salt (NaCl) is nearly vertical, which indicates little effect of temperature on solubility. The sodium sulfate
curve shows reverse solubility as temperature increases; thus, sodium sulfate has a tendency to coat heat-
exchanger surfaces where heat is added to saturated solutions of this system.

Often solid-liquid equilibrium data are not available for the system of interest, and experimental de-
termination of the solidus-liquidus curves is required. If the system of interest is simple (i-e., two to three
components) and well behaved (ideal), then reliable predictive methods are available. Techniques for
predicting nonideal solid-liquid phase behavior and multicomponent equilibria are emerging.

PREDICTING SOLID—LIQUID EQuiLiBRiA

The extent to which solids can dissolve in liquids varies enormously; in some cases a solid solute may
form a highly concentrated solution and in others the solubility is barely detectable. Some of the principles

that govern equilibrium between a solid phase and a liquid phase are discussed in this section. In many
situations reliable predictive techniques are available to estimate binary and multicomponent solubility
behavior, and several of these approaches also are discussed.

FRAMEWORK
The fundamental relationship for equilibrium to exist between two phases (where the solute is designated
by subscript 2) is

S(pure solid) = f,(solute in solution) (11.2-1)

or

S,(pure solid) = y2%2 fz (11.2-2)

where f, is the fugacity, x. is the solubility (mole fraction) of the solute in the solvent, +2 is the liquid
phase activity coefficient, and f} is the reference-state fugacity to which y, refers. The solubility can then
be defined as

=
Vf?

Thus, the solubility depends on the activity coefficient and the ratio of two fugacities. It is convenient
to define the reference-state fugacity (of solute) as the fugacity of pure, subcooled liquid at the temperature
of the solution. As derived elsewhere! the pure fugacity ratio can be calculated from

where Ah, is the enthalpy of fusion, 7), is the melting temperature of pure substance 2, and 7 is the system
temperature. Correction terms associated with differences between the heat capacities of the liquid and solid
are neglected.

If Eq. (11.2-4) is substituted into (11.2-3) the solubility relationship becomes

Ah, (T
In (72%) = Rr (7 - t) (11.2-5)

If the solution is assumed to be ideal, then y, = 1.0 and Eq. (11.2-5) becomes

Ah, [ T
Inx, = we - t) (11.2-6)
M

Equation (11.2-6) is often referred to as the van’t Hoff relationship. To use this equation to compute
solute solubility for an ideal solution only the heat of fusion Ah,, and the pure-component melting tem-
perature 7y, are required. The interesting feature of this equation is that the solubility depends only on the
properties of the solute and is independent of the nature of the solvent.

Another equation that is employed frequently for ideal systems uses cryoscopic constants that have been
obtained empirically for a wide variety of materials in the American Petroleum Institute Research Project

Freezing point curves were computed for para- and ortho-xylene using Eq. (11.2-6) (the van’t Hoff
equation) and Eq. (11.2-7) which used cryoscopic constants. Data from Table 11.2-1 were used in the
equations and calculated equilibrium compositions are shown as a function of temperature in Table 11.2-
2. The computed liquid compositions are nearly identical in the high concentration range and diverge

slightly in the dilute regime. Figure 11.2-5 is a plot of freezing-point depression curves for mixtures of
xylene isomers. The binary eutectic temperature for para and ortho isomers is about 236.3K. This is the
temperature at which both components solidify together. Thus, the mole fraction of ortho-xylene in solution
plus the mole fraction of para-xylene must equal 1 at the eutectic (x, + x, = 1.0). This condition also
fixes the eutectic temperature for multicomponent systems. The ternary eutectic temperature for a mixture
of xylene isomers is determined by finding the common freezing point at which the sum of the mole
fractions of mixed isomers in solution equals | (x, + x, + x, = 1.0). The eutectic conditions for the three
xylene isomer binaries are indicated in Fig. 11.2-5. The ternary eutectic is also indicated.

Determination of eutectic points is important since yield of a desired component is limited by the
position of the eutectic. The above procedures give accurate predictions of eutectic points in ideal binary
and multicomponent systems and are frequently sufficient for preliminary evaluation of a crystallization
system. For the final design of a commercial system, experimental verification of the eutectic is advisable.

For nonideal systems a number of approaches are available. The method to use in a specific case may
depend on the availability of thermodynamic parameters necessary to perform the specific calculation. Some
of the methods are direct and others require iterative techniques best relegated to computers. Activity
coefficients for solid-solubility calculations can often be estimated directly from vapor-liquid equilibrium
data obtained at higher temperatures. Experimental vapor-liquid equilibrium data frequently are easier to
find than solid-liquid equilibrium data; thus, this approach provides a convenient technique for conducting
preliminary design calculations to determine the feasibility of a given process. Data are correlated using a
semiempirical equation, such as the Wilson equation, whose characteristic binary parameters are extrapo-
lated with respect to temperature. Muir and Howat’ have reported the results of using this technique for
several ideal and nonideal systems and found good agreement with experimental data. Figures 11.2-6 and
11.2-7 compare predicted and experimental equilibrium data for acetic acid-water and caprolactam-water
binaries. Agreement between predicted and experimental freezing points is good.

For nonpolar systems the activity coefficient can be estimated using the Hildebrand-Scatchard* theory
of regular solutions. To calculate the activity coefficient of a dissolved solute using regular solution theory,
solubility parameters must be available for the components. For many materials these parameters can be
calculated and/or are available in standard engineering references.

A group-contribution method, called UNIFAC,> has been developed for estimating activity coefficients
in nonelectrolyte solutions. By using this approach solubilities for several solutes in a variety of solvents
may be calculated. In many cases good agreement is obtained. The activity coefficient consists of two
parts, the combinatorial contribution, arising from differences in molecular size and shape, and the residual
contribution, arising from differences in intermolecular forces of attraction. Group interaction parameters
must be available to use this approach. Parameters are listed by Fredenslund et al.° for many systems of
interest.

Other approaches to the computation of solid-liquid equilibria are shown in Table 11.2-3. The Soave-
Redlich~-Kwong equation of state evaluates fugacities to calculate solid-liquid equilibria,’ while Wenzel
and Schmidt® developed a modified van der Waals equation of state for the representation of phase equilibria.
The Wenzel~Schmidt approach generates fugacities, from which the authors developed a trial-and-error
approach to compute solid-liquid equilibrium. Unno et al.° recently presented a simplification of the solution
of groups model (ASOG) that allows prediction of solution equilibrium from limited vapor-liquid equilib-
rium data.

Often complex liquid-solid equilibria cannot be predicted reliably, nor are data available in the literature.
In this case, experimental determination of equilibrium behavior becomes necessary. Experimental data
should be obtained at conditions that allow fitting by a model so that interpolation and extrapolation are
possible.

The ASTM apparatus'® for determining freezing point is shown in Fig. 11.2-8. Freezing point is
obtained from freezing or melting temperature versus time curves. Figure 11.2-9 shows a typical temper-
ature-time trace from an ASTM apparatus. The freezing point can be determined from the peak of the
temperature rise during slow cooldown or from the break in the temperature-time curve during heating. A
DSC (differential scanning calorimeter) can be used for freezing-point determination (as well as heat of
fusion) if subcooling is low. Inorganic systems usually are handled well in a DSC apparatus. If many
components are present, an experimental freezing-point curve can be determined by fixing the temperature
of a well-mixed slurry containing an excess of solids, allowing the system to equilibrate, and analyzing
the composition of the liquid phase. By repeating this process at successively lower temperatures a freezing-
point curve can be developed.

11.2-2 Choice of Operational Mode

The technique employed to generate supersaturation in a solution is referred to as the mode of operation.
The mode chosen by the designer is strongly influenced by the phase-equilibrium characteristics of the
system, and it dictates the material and energy balance requirements of the system. The common techniques
for producing solids (or generating supersaturation) from a solution include:

1. Lowering the temperature of the feed solution by direct or indirect cooling. If solute solubility is
strongly temperature dependent, this is the preferred approach.

2. Adding heat to the system to remove solvent and thus ‘‘salt out’’ the solute. This technique is
effective if solubility is insensitive to temperature.

3. Vacuum cooling the feed solution without external heating. If solubility is strongly dependent on
temperature, this method is attractive.

4. Combining techniques. Especially common is vacuum cooling supplemented by extemal heating
for systems whose solubility has an intermediate dependence on temperature.

5. Adding nonsolvent. This is a common technique for precipitating solute from solution and is useful
as both a laboratory technique and as an industrial process for product recovery.

The methods described above can be employed in single- or multistage crystallization or in batch
operations. Multistage operations are employed where evaporative requirements exceed the capabilities of
a single vessel and/or energy costs dictate staging of the operation. Sometimes, staging is useful to produce
uniform and/or larger crystals. Operation of crystallizers in series generates crystal size distributions having
a narrower size spread than the same volume of crystallizers in parallel. Crystal growth kinetics usually
are favored at higher temperatures, so if the first stage of a two-stage crystallization system is operated at
a higher temperature, the overall CSD is enhanced. Batch crystallizers produce a narrower CSD than
continuous well-mixed units. For capacity requirements less than 500 kg/h, batch crystallization is often
more economical. If highly uniform crystals are required, which is the case for sugar, then batch operation
offers advantages. Table 11.2-4 compares the operational characteristics of several common modes of
crystallization. Both advantages and disadvantages are indicated.

11.2-3 Crystallization Kinetics

The kinetic phenomena that influence crystal size distributions are nucleation and growth. The driving force
for both these phenomena is supersaturation, and at some levels of supersaturation, both nucleation and
growth occur and compete for available solute. The purpose of the present discussion is to summarize key

aspects regarding the kinetics of crystal nucleation and growth and to indicate the process variables that
are likely to affect each.

It is obvious that supersaturation is a key variable in setting nucleation and growth rates and, as will
be shown in the following discussion, the dependence of these rates on supersaturation is affected by the
mechanism through which the process is occurring. This is made plain in Fig. 11.2-10, which shows the
influence of supersaturation on nucleation and growth. The key aspects in this figure are the qualitative
relationships of the two forms of nucleation to growth and to each other: growth rate and secondary
nucleation kinetics are low-order (shown as linear) functions of supersaturation, while primary nucleation

ae
Feed
Coolant | | 3
Cd

Operational Characteristics: Feed enters at higher saturation temperature than is maintained in the crys-
tallizer and is cooled in shell-and-tube or scraped-surface exchangers to remove sensible heat and heat of
crystallization. Solids encrustation problems are generally confined to the cooling surfaces.

Product

Advantages: Operation and control is simple. No vacuum equipment is necessary. Slurry density and
product recovery are fixed by the feed composition and by the temperature maintained in the crystallizer
body.

Disadvantages: Care must be taken to prevent fouling of the cooling surfaces by maintaining low process-
to-coolant temperature differences across cooling surfaces. If severe fouling is anticipated, scraped-surface
heat exchangers may be necessary to assure reliable operation.

Mode 2. Evaporative Cooling Crystallization

Feed

Product

Operational Characteristics: Feed enters at higher saturation temperature than is maintained in the crys-
tallizer body. Crystallizer temperature, product recovery, and slurry density are regulated by vacuum
control. Heat of crystallization and the sensible heat of the feed are removed by evaporation and conden-
sation of solvent. The condensate may either be removed or a portion or all returned.

Advantages: No heater is required in this mode of operation, and condensate can be returned to wash
down walls to control the formation of encrustations.

590

TABLE 11.2-4 (Continued)

Disadvantages: Slurry concentration and product yield are fixed by material and energy balance con-
straints.

Mode 3. Cooling and Salting Out Crystallization

Feed

Operational Characteristics: The feed stream saturation temperature is higher than that maintained in
the crystallizer body; thus, adiabatic cooling occurs. Also, external heat is added to evaporate solvent and
precipitate additional solute.

Advantages: Slurry density and yield can be controlled to some degree by adjustment of external heat
input.

Disadvantages: An external (or internal) heat exchanger and a vacuum system are required. Fouling at
vapor release surfaces is common.

Mode 4. Salting Out Crystallization (Addition of Nonsolvent)

Feed

Nonsolvent
feed

Product

Operational Characteristics: Crystallizer temperature is controlled by vacuum level and ratio of nonsol-
vent to feed. A reflux condenser normally is used to remove heat by condensing the solvent.

Advantages: System is reliable to operate. Encrustations are minimized since heating and cooling surfaces
are eliminated and vaporization is minimal.

Disadvantages: An additional component (nonsolvent) must be separated from all liquid streams and
recycled. The technique is somewhat limited since the nonsolvent must be miscible in solvent.

is shown to follow a high-order dependence on supersaturation. Design of a crystallizer to produce a desired
crystal size distribution requires kinetic data that quantify the relationships of nucleation and growth to
extemally controlled variables and to supersaturation. The following discussion necessarily is brief and
simply outlines some of the major factors that influence nucleation and growth kinetics. More complete
discussions of each phenomenon can be found in the references cited.

As with all kinetic phenomena, the first concept to understand is the driving force for the rate processes.
While supersaturation was represented above as the driving force for nucleation and growth, no clear
definition of this quantity was given. In fact, there are various ways in which the driving force or super-
saturation can be defined:

The difference between the solute concentration and the concentration at equilibrium, C — C*.
The difference between the system temperature and the temperature at equilibrium, T — T*.
The ratio of the solute concentration and the equilibrium concentration, C/C*.

The ratio of the difference between the solute concentration and the equilibrium concentration to
the equilibrium concentration, s = (C ~ C*)/C*.

een

Garside'! cites the analyses and restrictions which have led to the conclusion that the most appropriate
driving force for crystal growth is that given by the fourth of the possibilities listed above, s = (C — C*)/
C*. This definition of supersaturation will be used throughout the ensuing discussion. Garside also notes
that when dealing with hydrated salts, concentration should not be based on the anhydrous solute.

NUCLEATION

In crystallization, nucleation is the formation of a solid phase from a liquid phase. The process differs from
growth in that a new crystal results from the transfer of solute from the liquid to the solid; in growth, solid
is deposited on an existing crystal. Because it is the phenomenon of crystal formation, nucleation sets the
character of the crystallization process, and it is therefore the most critical component in relating crystallizer
design and operation to crystal size distributions.

Mechanisms. Classical nucleation theory is based on homogeneous and heterogeneous mechanisms,
both of which call for the formation of crystals through a process of sequentially combining the constituent
units that form a crystal. These mechanisms are referred to as primary nucleation because existing crystals
play no role in the nucleation. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous mechanisms require relatively high

Crystallization Operations 593

supersaturations in order for them to occur and they exhibit a high-order dependence on supersaturation.
These factors often lead to production of excessive fines in systems where primary nucleation mechanisms
are important.

Mullin’? outlines the classical theoretical treatment of primary nucleation, which results in the expression

Br = Acxp(

where & is the Boltzmann constant, ¢ is surface energy per unit area, v is molar volume, and A is a constant.
Note that this equation can be simplified by recognizing that s is often much less than 1, so that In (s +
1) approaches s:

16x0°U"
Oo — -'
B° = Aexp ( ae) (11.2-9a)

The most important variables affecting primary nucleation rates are shown by Eq. (11.2-9) to be interfacial
energy 0, temperature 7, and supersaturation s. The high-order dependence of nucleation rate on super-
saturation is especially important as a small variation in supersaturation may produce an enormous change
in nucleation rate. This gives rise to the often observed phenomenon of having a clear liquor transformed
into a slurry of very fine crystals with only a slight increase in supersaturation, for example, by decreasing
the solution temperature. The catalytic effect of solid particles (as in heterogeneous nucleation) is to reduce
the energy barrier to formation of a new phase. This, in effect, can reduce the interfacial energy o by
orders of magnitude.

An empirical approach to modeling primary nucleation requires a knowledge of the metastable limit
that a given solution can withstand before spontaneous nucleation occurs. This limit, which was first
observed in experiments by Miers and Issac,'? must be determined through experimentation, and nucleation
tate is then correlated with the equation

Bo =kC-C,) C*<C, (11.2-10)

where C is solute concentration, C,, is the solute concentration at which spontaneous nucleation occurs,
and C* is the solute concentration at saturation. Randolph and Larson'* indicate that C,, is very close to
C* for many inorganic systems, and they report satisfactory correlations with C* substituted for C,, in Eq.
(11.2-10).

Secondary nucleation is the formation of new crystals as a result of the presence of solute crystals; in
other words, crystals of the solute must be present for secondary nucleation to occur. Garside and Davey'®
and Larson'® give excellent reviews of the subject, so only a brief synopsis is provided here.

Several features of secondary nucleation make it more important than primary nucleation in industrial
crystallizers. First, continuous crystallizers and seeded batch crystallizers have crystals in the magma that
can participate in secondary nucleation mechanisms. Second, the requirements for the mechanisms of
secondary nucleation to be operative are fulfilled easily in most industrial crystallizers. Finally, most
crystallizers are operated in a low supersaturation regime so that crystal growth is regular and the resulting
product is pure and of good habit; low supersaturation can support secondary nucleation but not primary
nucleation.

Secondary nucleation can occur as the result of several mechanisms which have been identified and
observed in selected systems. These include initial breeding, contact nucleation (also known as collision
breeding), and shear breeding. Initial breeding results from immersion of seed crystals in a supersaturated
solution, and it is thought to be caused by dislodging extremely small crystals that were formed on the
surface of the crystals during drying. Although this mechanism is unimportant in continuous and unseeded
batch crystallization, it can have a significant impact on the operation of seeded batch crystallizers. Girolami
and Rousseau'’ demonstrate the effects of several process variables on nucleation rates caused by initial
breeding. Contact nucleation results from collisions of crystals with one another, crystallizer internals, or
with an impeller of an agitator or circulation pump. It should be recognized that the collision energy for
contact nucleation is small and does not necessarily result in the macroscopic degradation of the contacted
crystal. Because of the importance of this mechanism it will be discussed in more detail below. Shear
breeding results when supersaturated solution flows by a crystal surface and carries with it crystal precursors
believed formed in the region of the growing crystal surface. Sung et al.'* observed nucleation of
MgsO,°7H,0 by this mechanism and found that very high levels of supersaturation were required for it
to produce significant numbers of nuclei.

Process Variables Affecting Contact Nucleation. As stated above, contact nucleation results from a
collision of a crystal with an object, such as an impeller or other crystallizer internals, in a supersaturated
medium. The pioneering studies that elucidated many factors affecting this nucleation mechanism were

594 Charles G. Moyers, Jr. and Ronald W. Rousseau

carried out by Strickland-Constable and coworkers'?-? and Clontz and McCabe.”! These and subsequent
works demonstrate that the number of crystals produced by a controlled impact of an object with a seed crystal
depends on the energy of impact, supersaturation at impact, supersaturation at which crystals mature,
material of the impacting object, area of impact, angle of impact, and system temperature. Although it is
impossible to account quantitatively for each of these variables, certain generalizations can be drawn from
the research on this nucleation mechanism.

Tai et al.?? demonstrate that the number of crystals produced under controlled conditions is an expo-
nential function of impact energy E. Furthermore, a threshold or minimum collision energy E, is required
for some crystalline systems. Also, Shah et al.?* and Evans et al.?* found that the material of construction
of the impacting object greatly affects the number of crystals resulting from the collision. In particular,
coating the crystallizer internals or manufacturing them from soft materials reduces contact nucleation rates.
This is attributed to a reduction in the energy transmitted from the coated object to the impacted crystal.
Based on these two experimental observations, the following expression was proposed for systems at
constant supersaturation:”*

Bo =kyexp(E-E) E>E, (11.2-11)

In a crystallizer with a circulation pump or agitator, it has been shown that collisions between such a device
and crystals in the circulating magma dominate nucleation resulting from other collisions.”° Consequently,
it might be expected that a relationship of impact energy E to crystallizer variables must include the mass
of the impact crystal M,, and the rotational velocity of the impeller w. Moreover, the fraction of the
available energy actually transmitted to the crystal, €, should also be included in the model:

E = f(e, w, M.) (11.2-12)

The variables shown in Eq. (11.2-12) can be manipulated to some extent, thereby modifying nucleation
rates and the concomitant crystal size distribution. For example, internal classification can be used to keep
larger crystals away from energetic collisions with an impeller, but doing so may create other problems
with stability of the crystal size distribution. The rotational velocity of an impeller can be changed if there
are appropriate controls on the pump or agitator. Caution must be exercised, however, for a reduction in
circulation velocity can reduce heat transfer coefficients and increase fouling or encrustation on heat transfer
surfaces. Moreover, the crystals in the magma must be kept suspended or else crystal habit and growth
rates could be affected adversely. It is suspected that impact energy may have a high-order dependence on
rotational velocity, and if that is the case, modest changes in this quantity could alter nucleation rates
substantially. As already indicated, the fraction of the impact energy transmitted from an impeller to the
crystal can be manipulated by changing the material of construction of the impeller. Tai?’ also showed the
hardness of the crystal surface to be important in comparing nucleation characteristics of different crystalline
materials. Therefore, the importance of ¢ may vary from one crystalline system to another: those systems
in which the crystal face is soft may be more susceptible to nucleation rate changes due to the variables in
Eq. (11.2-12) than those crystalline systems where the face is hard.

Correlations of nucleation rate with crystallizer variables have been developed for several systems. For
example, Bennett et al.2* examined the effect of slurry circulation rate on nucleation and developed a
correlation based on the tip speed of the impeller. Grootscholten et al.?” considered the scale-up of nucleation
kinetics for sodium chloride crystallization, and they provide an analysis of the role of mixing and mixer
characteristics in contact nucleation. Garside and Shah“ reviewed published kinetic correlations though
about 1979.

Supersaturation has been observed to affect contact nucleation, but the mechanism by which this occurs
is not clear. There are data” that infer a direct relationship between contact nucleation and crystal growth.
These data show that the number of nuclei produced by an impact is proportional to the linear growth rate
of the impacted face. This is true even for citric acid which exhibits an unusual relationship between growth
rate and supersaturation. It has been proposed that the known effect of growth rates, which are determined
primarily by supersaturation, on the surface of the growing crystal provides the link between crystal growth
and contact nucleation.

A second perspective is that supersaturation influences the fraction of entities formed by a collision that
survive to form large crystals. This concept largely has been rejected based on the observation that such
entities are much larger than the size of a critical nucleus. Recent research" ** used photographic and
electronic zone-sensing techniques to examine the size distributions of particles formed by impacts with
seed crystals in a supersaturated solution. These experiments on potassium alum show that the particles
produced cover a size range from 50 zm down to the smallest size capable of being observed by the
instrument. Furthermore, the influence of supersaturation on the number of particles produced in the 20-
50 wm range was much greater than it was on the number produced in the smaller size range. Data that
will be discussed in the section on crystal growth have shown that dissolution of crystals formed by contact
nucleation does not occur, but that a fraction of the crystals grow very slowly and some may not grow at
all.

Still another possible role of supersaturation is that it affects the solution structure and perhaps causes

Crystallization Operations 595

the formation of clusters of solute molecules. These clusters may participate in nucleation, although the
mechanism by which this would occur is not clear. Mullin and Leci™ present evidence for the formation
of citric acid clusters in aqueous supersaturated solutions, and McMahon et al.*> have examined cluster
formation in solutions of KNO,; using Raman spectroscopy.

The ease with which nuclei can be produced by contact nucleation is a clear indication that this
mechanism is dominant in many industrial crystallization operations. Research on this nucleation mechanism
is continuing with the objective of building an understanding of the phenomenon that will allow its successful
inclusion in models describing commercial systems.

Crystat GROWTH

Crystal growth rates may be expressed in a variety of ways: as the linear advance rate of an individual
crystal face, as the change in a characteristic dimension of a crystal, or as the rate of change in mass of a
crystal. These different expressions can be related through an understanding of crystal geometry. However,
it is often convenient to use the method of measurement as the basis of the growth rate expression. In
certain instances an analysis of the crystallization process will require growth rate to be defined in a specific
way; for example, the use of a population balance to describe crystal size distribution requires that growth
rate be defined as the rate of change of a characteristic dimension.

Single-crystal studies of growth kinetics often involve the rate of advance of an individual crystal face
or the rate of change in crystal size associated with exposure to a supersaturated solution. The latter type
of study will be dealt with in discussions of multicrystal magmas. The rate of advance of a single crystal
face can be quantified by observation of the face through a calibrated eyepiece of an optical microscope.
Using this procedure, it is possible to examine the structure of the advancing crystal face and perhaps to
isolate surface reaction kinetics from mass transfer kinetics. These phenomena will be discussed later. An
additional advantage of this system is that it is possible to examine crystal growth kinetics without inter-
ference from competing processes such as nucleation.

Multicrystal magma studies usually involve examination of the rate of change of a characteristic crystal
dimension or the rate of increase in the mass of crystals in a magma. The characteristic dimension in such
analyses depends on the method used in the determination of crystal size; for example, the second largest
dimension is measured by sieve analyses, while an equivalent spherical diameter is determined by both
electronic zone-sensing and laser light-scattering instruments. A relationship between these two measured
dimensions and between the measured quantity and the actual crystal dimensions can be derived from
appropriate shape factors. Recall that volume and area shape factors are defined by the equations

V. = kU? (11.2-13)

and
A. = k,l? (11.2-14)

where V. and A, are volume and area of a crystal, k, and k, are volume and area shape factors, and L is
the characteristic dimension of the crystal. Suppose an equivalent spherical diameter L, is obtained from
an electronic zone-sensing instrument and the actual dimensions of the crystal, which is known to have a
cubic habit, are to be calculated. Let L, be the edge length of the crystal, and k,, and k,, be the volume
shape factors for a sphere and a cube, respectively. Since the volume of the crystal is the same, regardless
of the characteristic dimension,

V.= k,l? = k,l} (11.2-15)
which means that
k “3
L.= (=) L, (11.2-16)
koe

Since k,, is 7/6 and k,, is 1.0, the numerical relationship between these two dimensions can be determined
from Eq. (11.2-16).

If the rate of change of a crystal mass, dM,/dt, is measured, the quantity can be related to the rate of
change in the crystal characteristic dimension by the equation

In multicrystal magma systems, growth kinetics become difficult to isolate from other phenomena,
although a combined analysis, such as that described in Section 11.2-4 for the perfectly mixed crystallizer,
gives a realistic view of the actual process that occurs in a crystallizer, that is, nucleation and growth
kinetics are measured simultaneously and therefore at the same process conditions.

Growth Models. At least two resistances contribute to a determination of growth kinetics. The rate
processes to which these resistances apply are (1) integration or incorporation of the crystalline unit (e.g.,
solute molecules) into the crystal surface (lattice) and (2) molecular or bulk transport of the unit from the
surrounding solution to the crystal face. Since bulk transport is addressed elsewhere (see Chapter 2), this
discussion will focus only on surface incorporation. Detailed reviews of this topic can be found else-
where''?*-° so this discussion will be brief.

Numerous models have been proposed to describe surface reaction kinetics. Among these are models
that assume crystals grow by layers and other models that consider growth to occur by the movement of a
continuous step. Each model results in a specific relationship between growth rate and supersaturation, but
none can be used for a priori predictions of growth kinetics. Such models do provide insights as to the
effects of certain process variables on growth and, with additional research, may lead to predictive capa-
bilities. For these reasons and because of the extensive literature on the subject, all that will be pointed
out here are the key aspects of the ‘physical models and the resulting relationship between growth and
supersaturation predicted by each theory.

The model used to describe the growth of crystals by layers calls for a two-step process: (1) formation
of a two-dimensional nucleus on the surface and (2) spreading of the solute from the two-dimensional
nucleus across the surface. The relative rates at which these two steps occur give rise to the mononuclear
two-dimensional nucleation theory and the polynuclear two-dimensional nucleation theory. In the mono-
nuclear two-dimensional nucleation theory, the surface nucleation step occurs at a finite rate while the
spreading across the surface occurs at an infinite rate. The reverse is true for the polynuclear two-dimen-
sional nucleation theory. From the mononuclear two-dimensional nucleation theory, growth is related to
supersaturation by the equation

G = C\hAfin (1 + 5)}'? exp l-aeS| (11.2-19)

where C, and C, are system-dependent constants, # is the height of the nucleus, A is surface area, and s
and T are as defined earlier. The polynuclear two-dimensional theory produces the equation

= Gs _ CG, .
G= Gr a+ rr) mad ( Tin (+ 5) (11.220)

where C; is a system-dependent constant. Finally, if both formation of the two-dimensional nucleus and
spreading of the surface layer are important in determining growth rate, the following equation can be
derived:

G = C,s*"fln (1 + 5)" exp (-s_2—5) (11.2-21)

where C, is a system-dependent constant.

Equations (11.2-19), (11.2-20), and (11.2-21) can be simplified considerably by recognizing that in
many systems the quantity s is much less than 1. In that case, In (1 + s) is approximately s. Making this
substitution, the growth rate from the mononuclear two-dimensional theory becomes

G = C,hAs'? exp (-2) (11.2-22)
For the polynuclear two-dimensional nucleation theory
Cy C2
C= (2x) exp (- ) (11.2-23)
For both steps occurring at similar rates

G = G,s*" exp (-2) (11.2-24)

The screw dislocation theory, which was formulated by Burton, Cabrera, and Frank“ and is often
referred to as the BCF theory, shows that the dependence of growth rate on supersaturation can vary from
a parabolic relationship at low supersaturations to a linear relationship at high supersaturations. In the BCF

Crystallization Operations 597

theory, growth rate is given by
‘es? oi
G= c(=) tanh <!) (11.2-25)
a} €s

where € is screw dislocation activity and o| is a system-dependent quantity that is inversely proportional
to temperature. The dependence of growth rate on supersaturation is linear if the ratio o{/es is small, but
this dependence becomes parabolic as the ratio becomes large. This is because tanh x approaches x as x
becomes small (supersaturation becomes large), and tanh x approaches 1.0 as x becomes large (supersa-
turation becomes small). It is possible then to observe variations in the dependence of growth rate on
supersaturation for a given crystal-solvent system.

An empirical approach can also be used to relate growth kinetics to supersaturation. This approach
simply fits the data with a power-law function of the form

G = kgs* (11.2-26)

where kg and g are constants determined by fitting the equation to growth rate data. Such an approach
should be valid over small ranges of supersaturation. In fact, careful analysis of the theories discussed
above will show that the more fundamental equations can be fit by Eq. (11.2-26) over limited ranges of
supersaturation.

Effects of Impurities and Solvent. The presence of impurities can alter substantially the growth rates
of crystalline materials. The alteration that is most common is for the growth rates to be decreased. It is
often thought that impurities must be molecularly similar to the solute to have an impact on crystal growth.
However, impurities with few similarities to the crystallizing species have been observed to reduce growth
rates. This may be because structurally similar complexes have been formed between the impurity and
solvent or another species in the solution, but such events are difficult to identify. Because additions of
impuritiés to a crystallizing system most often result in a reduced crystal growth rate, it is critical that feed
solutions be as free from contamination as possible. This is one way in which the operation of process
units upstream of a crystallizer can affect crystal size distribution. Therefore, it is suggested that a strict
protocol be followed in operating units such as reactors or other separation equipment upstream of the
crystallizer. Equally important is monitoring the composition of recycle streams so as to detect the accu-
mulation of impurities. Moreover, crystallization kinetics obtained on small-scale equipment for use in
design or analysis should be obtained using solutions as similar as possible to that expected in the full-
scale process.

Another important effect associated with the presence of impurities is that they may change the crystal
habit. Habit alteration is considered to result from unequal changes in the growth rates of different crystal
faces. Davey*' reviews the role of impurities in the general context of habit modification. Surfactants,
especially, have been observed to modify growth rates of individual faces and thereby change the habit of
a crystal.

The mechanism by which an impurity affects crystal growth rate is considered to involve adsorption
of the impurity onto the crystal surface. Once located on the surface, the impurity forms a barrier to solute
transfer from the solution to the crystal. This model has been used to relate the growth rate of a crystal to
the concentration of impurity in solution through an adsorption isotherm.**“ An alternative theory calls
for the adsorbed impurity to occupy active growth sites, thereby preventing attachment of solute to the
surface. Still another concept of the impact of an impurity on growth rate calls for integration of the
impurity into the crystal structure, which leads to two deleterious effects: reduction of growth rate and
production of impure product. Few generalities exist in describing the role of impurities in crystallization
phenomena, and it is usual to rely on experimental data that are often correlated empirically. Mullin’? lists
several systems in which habit modifiers have been used effectively. An interesting prospect raised by the
work of McMahon et al.°> is that impurities may have a strong effect on the formation of solute clusters
and ultimately crystal growth.

The solvent from which a material is crystallized can influence the crystal habit and growth rate.
Bourne*® ascribes the effects of a solvent to two sets of factors: one has to do with the effects of solvent
on mass transfer of the solute through adjustments in viscosity, density, and diffusivity; the second is
concerned with the structure of the interface between the crystal and solvent. The analysis provided by
Bourne concludes that a solute-solvent system having a high solubility is likely to produce a rough interface
and concomitantly large crystal growth rates.

Crystal Growth in Mixed Crystallizers. As described earlier, crystal growth rates in muiticrystal
magmas are defined in terms of the rate of change of a characteristic dimension

It will be shown in a later section that the solution of a differential population balance requires a knowledge
of the relationship between growth rate and size of the growing crystals. Moreover, this relationship can
often be deduced from the form of population density data. A special condition, which simplifies such
balances, results when all crystals in the magma grow at the same constant rate. Crystal-solvent systems
that show this behavior are said to follow the AL Law proposed by McCabe,” while systems that do not
are said to exhibit anomalous growth.

Anomalous growth is a term used here to indicate that growth rates of crystals in a magma are not
identical or that the growth rate of an individual crystal or mass of crystals is not constant. Two theories
have been used to explain growth rate anomalies: size-dependent growth and growth rate dispersion. As
with systems that follow the AL Law, anomalous growth results in characteristic forms of population density
data. Unfortunately, such data cannot be used to distinguish between size-dependent growth and growth
rate dispersion, because both have the same qualitative effects on population density.

Size-Dependent Crystal Growth. A number of empirical expressions that correlate the apparent effect
of crystal size on growth rate are summarized by White et al.*’ However, only a few of these meet the
following requirements for use in population balances: (1) the expression must be continuous over the
entire size range including L = 0; (2) the growth rate of zero-size crystals must not be zero; (3) the growth
rate expression must allow convergence of moments of the crystal size distribution. The most often used
correlation of size-dependent growth kinetic data is the Abegg-Stevens-Larson (ASL) growth rate expres-
sion.** This equation uses three empirical parameters to correlate growth rate with crystal size:

G=G°(1 ty? b<1 (11.2-28)

where G°, y and b are determined from experimental data.

There have been attempts to relate the kinetic parameter b to crystallizer variables; Garside and Jancic®
showed a qualitative dependence on crystallizer volume, and Rousseau and Parks correlated b with G° and
r. Several theories have been proposed to explain size-dependent growth kinetics, but none has been
substantiated by direct observation or used to predict the onset of such behavior. One explanation seems
particularly appealing: larger crystals impact impellers and other crystallizer internals with higher frequency
and energy than smaller crystals; the larger crystals are therefore recipients of more surface breaks and
irregularities that lead to higher growth rates.

At the small end of the size range, crystals in mixed magmas have been observed**->'-* to give the
appearance of growing at much reduced rates. Theories proposed to explain these observations are as
follows: (1) it is assumed that smaller crystals have fewer surface defects to enhance crystal growth; (2)
smaller crystals are assumed to have an increased solubility; (3) when small crystals are formed they are
more spherical than more-developed crystals and a high surface energy is involved when the crystal shape
goes from spherical to that characteristic of the crystal.

Growth Rate Dispersion. The phenomenon of growth rate dispersion is the exhibition of different
growth rates by crystals in a magma, even though they have the same size and are exposed to identical
conditions. Both zero growth and abrupt changes in growth rates of individual crystals can be exhibited.
This dispersion in growth rates can have significant effects on crystal population, leading in general to a
broadening of the size distribution. As was discussed under size-dependent growth, growth rate dispersion
may lead to population densities with characteristics that are different from those following the AL Law.
These characteristics will become more apparent in Section 11.2-4. The phenomenological aspects of growth
tate dispersion are discussed in the following paragraphs.

White and Wright®® first characterized the effects of growth rate dispersion on a population of sucrose
crystals by correlating the variance of the population about a mean size L. They correlated the variance
with the extent of growth of the crystals in a seeded batch crystallizer. The original crystals were of uniform
size and the mean of the crystal size distribution was used as a measure of the extent of growth. The
relationship between the variance and extent of growth was linear and had slope p, which was proportional
to the rate of spreading of the distribution. Growth rate dispersion for sucrose was found to be significant
(p = 67 pm), but negligible dispersion (p = 1 um) was observed for aluminum trihydroxide. The slope
p did not depend on the initial seed size (10-500 ym) or the stirring rate in the crystallizer; it decreased
when growth rate or impurity concentration increased, or when brief intervals of dissolution occurred.
Janse and de Jong™-*> found growth rate dispersion important in the growth of large potassium dichromate
and potassium alum crystals and demonstrated that this phenomenon could account for anomalous char-
acteristics in the population density of crystals obtained from continuous, steady-state crystallizers. They
concluded that growth rate dispersion could provide an explanation of what had been considered to be size-
dependent growth, but they also indicated that both phenomena could occur simultaneously and cause the
aforementioned anomalous behavior; in other words, the occurrence of growth rate dispersion does not rule
out the possibility that single-crystal growth may be size dependent.

Recent microscopic studies of individual secondary nuclei have observed growth rate dispersion and
size-dependent growth directly.*'-° Garside et al. report that two types of potassium alum secondary

Crystallization Operations 599

nuclei form after gentle contact of a seed crystal. Those less than 4 ym in size were created in larger
numbers and were formed even if the solution was undersaturated. The number of such nuclei was relatively
independent of supersaturation. These nuclei grew more slowly than larger ones and, in some cases, did
hot grow at a measurable rate. The number and size of nuclei between 4 and 50 um in size increased as
supersaturation was increased. Large crystals were not formed in saturated or undersaturated solution and
in supersaturated solutions fended to grow more rapidly than small crystals.

Girolami and Rousseau*’ analyzed batch data to show that apparent size-dependent growth of potassium
alum crystals is in fact a manifestation of growth rate dispersion. Crystals of citric acid monohydrate
generated by contact nucleation were found by Berglund and Larson*® to exhibit growth rate dispersion but
not size-dependent growth. Very slow or zero growth rates for small secondary nuclei have been reported
for aqueous solutions of pentaerythritol® and sodium chloride.” Several types of nuclei were distinguished
by their size, shape, and individual growth behavior.

Two distinctly different mechanisms that lead to growth rate dispersion have experimental support. The
first, which was proposed by Randolph and White,°' assumes that all crystals have the same time-averaged
growth rate but the growth rates of individual crystals fluctuate about some mean value. Direct evidence
of random fluctuations i in growth rates has been reported for magnesium sulfate heptahydrate™ and potas-
sium alum.“ The second proposed mechanism for growth rate dispersion assumes that crystals are born
with a characteristic distribution of growth rates but individual crystals retain a constant growth rate
throughout their residence in a crystallizer. This mechanism is supported by findings on citric acid,**
potassium nitrate,“ and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate. Ail these studies found nuclei to have a
distribution of growth rates and individual crystals to have constant growth rates.

The surface integration step for crystal growth is thought to be the primary factor in both mechanisms
of growth rate dispersion, and the BCF growth theory can be used to provide a qualitative explanation of
the growth rate dispersion phenomenon. From the BCF theory, the growth rate of a crystal face is dependent
on the number, sign, and location of screw dislocations on the surface of a growing crystal. Collisions of
crystals with each other and crystallizer internals result in changes in the dislocation network of a crystal
and lead to the random fluctuations of growth rates. Changes in the dislocation networks also occur simply
due to the imperfect growth of crystal faces. A distribution of growth rates is a result of the varying
dislocation networks and densities among nuclei and seed crystals.

Although evidence for both mechanisms of growth rate dispersion exists, separate mathematical models
have been developed for incorporating the two mechanisms into descriptions of crystal populations. Random
growth rate fluctuations were characterized by Randolph and White®' with a growth rate diffusivity parameter
Dg which is representative of the magnitude of the growth rate fluctuations. This model is similiar to that
used to describe molecular diffusion and axial dispersion associated with velocity fluctuations. Mathematical
models of growth rate dispersion due only to the growth rate distribution mechanism have been developed
using different methods by Janse and de Jong®’ and Larson and coworkers.” These models characterize
the growth rate distribution mechanism of growth rate dispersion by a distribution function having a mean
growth rate G and a growth rate variance 07. Zumstein and Rousseau’! have extended such models by
showing how both mechanisms of growth rate dispersion can be included and by illustrating the relative
effects of the two mechanisms on CSD from batch and continuous crystallizers.

Experimental efforts to determine the importance of the two mechanisms of growth rate dispersion have
been involved mainly with the measurement of the spread in crystal size distribution during constant-
supersaturation, isothermal batch crystallizations. The model for random growth rate fluctuations predicts
the variance of the crystal size distribution will increase linearly with the extent of growth, while the model
for a distribution of constant crystal growth rates predicts the variance to increase with the extent of growth
squared. The original work by White and Wright on sucrose™ supports the growth rate fluctuation mech-
anism, while the mechanism associated with a growth rate Aistribution is supported by data on contact
nuclei of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate® and citric acid.”° Although there is experimental support for
both mechanisms, it is still unclear how crystallizing conditions affect the relative importance of the two
mechanisms.

11.2-4 MODEL OF A WELL-MIXED CRYSTALLIZER

In this section, the principles involved in using a population balance to describe the crystal size distribution
in the product from a well-mixed continuous crystallizer are illustrated. The primary objective of this
treatment is to show how nucleation and growth kinetics can be evaluated from data on the crystal size
distribution produced in such crystallizers. Detailed development of the theory and extensions of these
principles to crystallizers that employ selective removal of crystals from the crystallizer internals or to batch
or transient continuous crystallizers is provided by Randolph and Larson. '*

APPLICATION OF A POPULATION BALANCE
The basis of a population balance is that the number of crystals in a system is a balanceable quantity. Such
balances are coupled to the usual mass and energy balances describing any system, and the crystals are

600 Charles G. Moyers, Jr. and Ronald W. Rousseau

assumed to be sufficiently small and numerous so that the crystal size distribution may be considered to be
a continuous function of a variable with which individual crystals are to be characterized. In this discussion,
the variable is the characteristic dimension (size) of the crystal.

A balance on the number of crystals in any size range—say L, to L,—must account for crystals that
enter and leave that size range by convective fiow into and out of the control volume V; and for crystals
that enter and leave the size range by growth. Crystal breakage and agglomeration are ignored in this
discussion, and it is assumed that crystals are formed by nucleation at or near size zero. Now define a
quantity called population density n so that the number of crystals dN(L) in the size range L to L + dL is
given by

dN(L) = Vrn(L) db (11.2-29)

It is important to note that either clear liquor volume or slurry volume can be taken as a basis for the
definition of n. For example, if clear liquor volume is taken as the basis, V; becomes the volume of clear
liquor in the control volume. With this definition of the population density, it can be shown that the
population balance on a well-mixed continuous crystallizer is given by

268) -( an 2)

V,—— + Qn -— Qin; = harve +n a (11.2-30)

where Q; and Q, are volumetric flow rates of either clear liquor or slurry into and out of the crystallizer,
respectively. Equation (11.2-30) can now be simplified as follows: assume that the feed liquor contains no
crystals (n; = 0); restrict growth to follow the AL Law [8(nG)/@L = Gdn/dL}; specify that the magma
volume is constant (8V;/dt = 0); and operate the crystallizer at steady state (dn/dt = 0).

If all four of these restrictions apply, and if a mean residence time 7 (often called drawdown time) is
defined as V;/Q,, the population balance can be written

G—+-<0 (11.2-31)
which may be integrated, using the boundary condition n(0) = n°, to give

n= n° exp (-z) (11.2-32)

If the assumptions that lead to Eq. (11.2-32) are valid, and they often are, a straight line will result if
n is plotted versus L on semilog coordinates. Furthermore, the growth rate of crystals can be determined
from the slope of the plot, which is —1/Gr. The nucleation rate is related to the intercept of the plot, 2°,
by the expression

B°=n°G (11.2-33)

Equations (11.2-32) and (11.2-33) can be used to obtain nucleation and growth rates from population
density measurements on a crystallizer that conforms to the assumptions stated above. This means that n
must be determined as a function of L. There are various techniques for obtaining particle size distributions,
and the procedures for determining n from these data varies according to the device used for the analysis.
Although complete coverage of the advantages and disadvantages of available particle size analyzers is
beyond the scope of this chapter, two common techniques are discussed briefly in the following paragraphs.

Sieves. Dry and/or wet sieve analyses provide differential or cumulative weight distributions. Ob-
viously, crystals must be in the size range appropriate for a given set of sieves in order for this procedure
to be used. The processes of sampling, sample treatment, and sieving can modify the crystal size distribution
if care is not taken to prevent agglomeration, crystal abrasion, and crystal breakage. In most sieving
techniques, obtaining representative material for sieving requires that crystals be filtered carefully from the
mother liquor and dried, and prior to drying it may be necessary to wash the crystals with a nonsolvent to
prevent agglomeration. When working the first time with a crystalline material, some experimentation may
be necessary to develop a good sieving practice and to find an appropriate wash liquor.

Once satisfactory sieving has been accomplished, n(L) is determined from the following relationship
derived from the definition of the cumulative weight distribution data:

M,AW(L)

n(L) = AL pk, L?

(11.2-34)

Crystallization Operations 601

where M; is magma density or mass of crystals per unit volume of clear liquor or slurry, AW(L) is the
fraction of the total mass of crystals retained on the sieve having an average size L, AL is the interval in
size between the sieve and the next largest sieve in the nest, , is the density of the crystal, k, is the volume
shape factor, and L is the average of the size of the sieve and the next largest sieve in the nest.

Electronic Particle Size Analyzers. These devices typically measure changes in a property such as
light diffraction, light scattering, light blockage, or electrical conductance to determine the size of a particle.
Changes in these measured quantities depend on the volume of the particle being sized, and hence this is
the property actually determined by the instrument. The characteristic dimension assigned to the particle
is that of a sphere having a volume equivalent to the measured volume. The output from these instruments
can be in two forms: a particle volume distribution or a number distribution. The volume distribution data
can be converted to population densities using Eq. (11.2-34) and assigning the particles the shape factor
of a sphere, «/6. Several devices give population density data directly, and conversions to other forms are
unnecessary.

There is considerable technique required in appropriately interpreting the data from electronic particle
size analyzers. Vendors can be quite helpful in the development of a measurement procedure, but some
experimentation should be expected with each new system.

Kinetic MODELS

Once nucleation and growth kinetics have been obtained using the procedures outlined above, correlations
of them as functions of process variables are required to use the population balance model for predictive
purposes. As discussed in Section 11.2-3, the important variables affecting nucleation and growth kinetics
include temperature, supersaturation, magma density, and external stimuli that can cause nucleation, such
as agitation or circulation rate of the magma. In Section 11.2-3 some of the important mechanisms by
which nucleation and growth occur were described. These mechanisms should be the basis of models of
crystallization kinetics, even though the actual correlations are empirical. Power-law functions are used
most frequently in correlating nucleation and growth rates, but the choice of the independent variables can
be justified from a mechanistic perspective. For example, systems that are believed to follow secondary
nucleation mechanisms should include a variable reffecting the character of crystals in the crystallizer, such
as magma density. The most commonly used power-law functions are

B° = k,s°Mi, (11.2-35)
and

G =ks* (11.2-36)

Several methods for expressing supersaturation were described in Section 11.2-3; it is often very difficult
to measure this quantity, especially in systems that have high growth rates. In these systems, supersaturation
is often so small that it is difficult to measure accurately, and it can be neglected in writing a solute mass
balance. However, it is important in setting nucleation and growth rates. A useful technique in such
instances is to substitute growth rate for supersaturation by combining Eqs. (11.2-35) and (11.2-36). This
gives

B° = k,G'M4, (11.2-37)

The constant k,, depends on process variables other than supersaturation and magma density, such as
temperature, rate of agitation or circulation, and presence of impurities. If sufficient data are available,
these variables may be separated from the constant by adding more terms in a power-law correlation.
However, k,, is essentially a constant specific to the operating equipment and not transferable from one
scale of equipment to another. The solute-solvent-specific constants i and j are obtainable from experimental
data and may be used in scale-up.

PARAMETER EVALUATION

As shown above, growth rate G can be obtained from the slope of a plot of the log of population density
data against crystal size; nucleation rate B° can be obtained from the same data by using the relationship
B° = n°G, where In n° is the intercept of the plot with the axis at L = 0, Nucleation rates obtained by
these procedures should be checked by comparison with values obtained from a mass balance. It can be
shown that the magma density of a slurry in a perfectly mixed crystallizer is given by

M; = 6 p,k,n° (Gr)* (11.2-38)
Rearranging this equation and substituting n° = B°/G, we obtain

After nucleation and growth rates have been obtained from population density data, the exponents i
and j in Eq. (11.2-37) can be determined using graphical techniques or multivariable linear regression. For
example, i can be obtained from data on several runs of varying residence times. Each run will yield values
of B°, n°, and G. If slurry concentration (magma density) M; is the same for all runs, the slope of a
fogarithmic plot of n° versus G will give i. If slurry concentration varies slightly from run to run, then a
logarithmic plot of B°/M; versus G will smooth the data so that i can be obtained from the slope of the
plot. Confidence in the parameters i and j requires that sufficient data be accumulated to make such
correlations statistically reliable. Typical values of kinetic orders are given in Table 11.2-5, and a more
complete list is given by Garside and Shah.”

CHARACTERISTICS OF CRYSTAL SiZE DistRiBUTIONS FROM MSMPR CRrYSTALLIZERS

The preceding discussion centered on the development of expressions for the population density function
in terms of nucleation and growth kinetics. It is also possible to express the properties of a crystal size
distribution in terms of a mass density function m. The two density functions can be shown to be related
by the expression

= p.kyLin (11.2-40)

The perfectly mixed, continuous, steady-state mixed-suspension mixed-product removal (MSMPR) crys-
tallizer is restrictive in the degree to which characteristics of a crystal size distribution can be varied.
Indeed, examination of Eqs. (11.2-32) and (11.2-40) shows that once nucleation and growth kinetics are
fixed in these systems the crystal size distribution is determined in its entirety. In addition, such distributions
have the following characteristics:

1. The mode or maximum of the mass density function occurs at the dominant crystal size Lp, which
is given by

Lp = 3Gr (11.2-41)

2. Moments of the population density are given by the expression
m,; = iin®(Gr)i*! (11.2-42)
3. The coefficient of variation of the mass density function, which is a measure of the spread of the

distribution about the dominant crystal size, is 50%. Such a distribution may be too broad to be acceptable
for certain crystalline products, such as sugar.

Crystallization Operations 603

4. The magma density M; (mass of crystals per unit volume of slurry or liquor) may be obtained from
the third moment of the population density function. As shown above, this quantity is related to nucleation
and growth rates by Eq. (11.2-38). Although magma density is a function of the kinetic parameters n° and
G, it can be measured independently of crystal size distribution and, where possible, it should be used, as
indicated above, as a constraint in evaluating nucleation and growth rates from measured crystal size
distributions.

5. A pair of kinetic parameters, one for nucleation rate and another for growth rate, describe the
crystal size distribution for a given set of crystallizer operating conditions. Furthermore, variation in one
of the kinetic parameters without changing the other is not possible.

6. Properties of the distribution may be evaluated explicitly from the moment equations:

PARAMETERS FROM SYSTEMS EXHIBITING ANOMALOUS GROWTH
Two types of anomalous growth behavior were described in Section 11.2-3: growth rate dispersion and
size-dependent growth. As pointed out, the effects of these mechanistically different phenomena on crystal
size distributions are the same; both cause curvature in semilog plots of population density against size.
Moreover, when size-dependent growth rates increase with crystal size, both cause a broadening of the
distribution. In this discussion, methods will be presented that illustrate evaluation of the parameters in
systems following size-dependent growth kinetics. Research is in progress on development of similar
procedures for systems deemed to follow growth rate dispersion anomalies, and the current literature should
be followed for such cases.

A number of empirical size-dependent growth expressions have been developed. Of these, the ASL
model given in Eq. (11.2-28) is the most commonly used. Substituting this equation into the differential
population balance given by Eq. (11.2-31), the steady-state population density function can be derived as

_ 1-5
n= n%(1 + yL)~* exp Cove) @<1 (11.2-44)

This equation is often simplified by restricting -+y to be equal to 1/G°7, which reduces the number of model
parameters by one and often results in a fit to data that is nearly as good as the three-parameter model.
The reduced ASL model (y = 1/G°z) leads to the following equation for population density:

4 Ot - 5

a -) exp Cee L i =f 2 ) (11.2-45)

Garside and Jancic*® noted the relationship of several magma properties to the parameter b in the ASL
growth model. O’Dell and Rousseau” derived formulas for estimating the characteristics of crystal size
distributions in terms of parameters in size-dependent growth kinetic models and for crystallizers with
selective removal of fines and/or product. For systems whose growth follows the reduced ASL equation,
it was shown that total length of crystals per unit volume of magma or liquor, surface area of crystals per
unit volume, mass of crystals per unit volume (magma density), mass average size, coefficient of variation,
and dominant size could be calculated from the equations

Ly = C\n*(G°ry (11.2-46)
Ar = k,C,n*(G°r)* (11.2-47)

The constants in Eqs. (11.2-46)-(11.2-51) are functions of b only, and they are given in Table 11.2-6.
The table can be used to estimate the desired property of a crystal size distribution from the model parameters
and Egs. (11.2-46)-(11.2-51), or it can be used in evaluating the model parameters from experimental data
as described below.

It should be clear that the form of the population density function given by Eq. (11.2-32) (systems that
follow the AL Law) is much simpler than those of Eqs. (11.2-44) and (11.2-45). This increase in complexity
for systems that exhibit anomalous growth makes extraction of model parameters more difficult. Not only
do anomalous growth models have more parameters, but the curvature in plots of the log of the population
density against size means that parameters must be determined by using nonlinear least-squares regressions.
For example, fitting the reduced form of the ASL equation requires evaluation of the parameters n°, G°,
and b in Eq. (11.2-45), and the estimate of n° is extremely sensitive to the few data points frequently
obtained at very small sizes. Moreover, nonlinearities in the semilogarithmic relationship between popu-
lation density and size frequently are most severe at small sizes. Consequently, it is very difficult to
determine n° with any real accuracy.

Rousseau and Parks® simplified this problem by substituting Eq. (11.2-48) into Eg. (11.2-45) to
eliminate n°

Experimentally determined population density, measured M; and the values of C, in Table 11.2-6 can then
be used to evaluate the two remaining adjustable parameters b and G°. Interpolation of C; is assisted by
a polynomial fit to 5

The effects of the two growth rate dispersion mechanisms on the CSD in a mixed-suspension, mixed-
product removal (MSMPR) continuous crystallizer are different. Random growth rate fluctuations do not
affect the spread of the CSD from an MSMPR crystallizer and the resulting population density function is
indistinguishable from that obtained assuming applicability of the AL Law. However, growth rate fluctua-
tions do increase the mean crystal size from that which is expected from the AL Law. On the other hand.
CSD from a continuous crystallizer is affected noticeably by assigning a distribution of constant crystal
growth rates to the nuclei. This mechanism causes the type of curvature in population density plots that
typically has been ascribed to size-dependent growth.

Crystallization Operations 605

A model that combines growth rate dispersion mechanisms has been derived by Zumstein and Rous-
seau.”* The expression for population density derived from their model is

n(L) = <—-> ——— \ £°(G) exp (-2) dG (11.2-54)
( {Gf°(G)/S] dG

0

where f°(G) is the distribution of nuclei growth rates and S, which is between 0 and 1, is given by

2 V2

The other terms are as defined earlier. This equation was used to demonstrate that random growth rate
fluctuations may damp out the effect of the growth rate distribution function, thereby causing the effects
of growth rate dispersion to be unobservable in a continuous crystallizer.”' Moreover, it is shown that an
understanding of growth rate dispersion may be a key factor in obtaining realistic models for scale-up.”>

PREFERENTIAL REMOVAL OF CRYSTALS

Crystal size distributions produced in a perfectly mixed crystallizer are highly constrained, and nucleation
and growth kinetics are determined exclusively by the crystalline system and the variables that define the
state of the crystallizer. Accordingly, specification of the feed variables (flow rate, temperature, pressure,
and solute concentration), the crystallizer variables (temperature, pressure in an adiabatic cooling process,
agitation or magma circulation rate, and solids fraction in an evaporative crystallizer), and crystallizer
geometry determines magma density and other characteristics of the crystal size distribution.

Crystallizers are made more flexible by the introduction of selective removal devices that alter the
residence time distribution of materials flowing from the crystallizer. The functions of classified removal
are best described in terms of idealized models of clear-liquor advance, classified-fines removal, and
classified-product removal. Clear-liquor advance is the removal of mother liquor from the crystallizer
without simultaneous removal of crystals. The effects of implementing this removal function are described
in Section 11.5-2. The primary objective of fines removal is preferential withdrawal from the crystallizer
of crystals whose size is below some specified value; with the withdrawal, dissolution, and retum of the
solution to the crystallizer, the growth of larger crystals is enhanced. Classified-product removal is carried
out to remove preferentially those crystals whose size is larger than some specified value.

The effects of each of the selective removal functions on crystal size distributions can be described in
terms of the population density function n. If it is assumed that perfect classification of fines and product
crystals is implemented, then the following expression for population density results:

ForL s l
RL

ForL 2 le

= n° exp (-R DE (—s) (-2) .

n=n exp ( Gr ) exp Gr exp G (11.2-58)

where the fines are below size Le and have a removal rate R times what would exist for perfect mixing,
the coarse product is greater than size L- and has a removal rate Z times that of the perfectly mixed
crystallizer. If fines removal is implemented alone, Z = 1, and if classified product removal is implemented
without fines removal, R = 1. Selection of a crystallizer that has both classified-fines and classified-product
removal functions usually is done so as to combine the best features of each: increased dominant size and

narrower distribution. The model of the crystallizer and selective removal devices that led to Eqs. (11.2-
56)-(11.2-58) is referred to as the R-Z crystallizer. It is an obvious idealization of actual crystallizers
because of the perfect cuts assumed at L- and Lp. However, it is a useful approximation to many systems
and it allows qualitative analyses of complex operations.

Although many commercial crystallizers operate with some form of selective crystal removal, devices
that implement these functions add to the complexity of the operation. In addition, Randolph et al.’® have
established that classified-product removal can lead to cycling of the crystal size distribution. A review of
the simulation and control of crystal size distributions has been provided by Randolph.”” Properties of the
crystal size distribution have been given in terms of R and Z and the moments of the crystal size distri-
bution.

BATCH CRYSTALLIZATION
As with continuous crystallizers, the mode by which supersaturation is generated affects the yield and
crystal size distribution, but batch crystallizers are strongly influenced by the rate at which supersaturation
is generated. For example, in a cooling mode there are several avenues that can be followed in reducing
the temperature of the batch system: natural cooling in which a batch is simply allowed to release heat to
a constant-temperature heat sink, cooling in which the rate of heat transfer is constant, cooling in which
the supersaturation is maintained constant, and size-optimal cooling whose objective is to vary the cooling
rate so that the supersaturation in the crystallizer is adjusted to produce an optimal crystal size distribution.
The effects of these and other modes of operation on crystal size distribution are discussed by Tavare et
al.”* Other important features of batch crystallizers are reviewed by Wey” and Randolph and Larson.'*
Perhaps the most troublesome aspect of batch crystallizers is the difficulty associated with reproducing
crystal size distributions in going from one batch to the next. This may be overcome through seeding!
and control of mixing conditions. In general, however, the development of methods for design and analysis
of batch crystallizers lags those for continuous systems.

11.3) SOLUTION CRYSTALLIZATION

Crystallization is a commonly used industrial separation and purification technique. If the desired product
is an evaporate (or filtrate) rather than a crystalline phase, then the process emphasis is primarily that of
separation rather than purification. In either case there is a strong interaction and dependence between both
degree of separation and purification and the particulate nature of the solid phase produced. Fundamental
research on crystallization has focused mainly on understanding the variables that influence the structure
and size of the crystalline phase, recognizing that better knowledge and control of this aspect would permit
improvement of the unit operation of crystallization, both as a separation and purification technique.

11.3-1 State-of-the-Art

Use of mathematical models for designing industrial crystallizers has lagged other chemical processing
operations because of the complexities of rationally describing and interrelating growth and nucleation
kinetics with the process configuration and mechanical features of the crystallizer. Crystallizers have tra-
ditionally been designed by scale-up of pilot- or bench-scale data, taking care to control supersaturation
levels and to maintain similar crystal residence time, vessel configuration, and hydraulic regimes. System
kinetics, even though controlling the ultimate crystal size distribution, were thought to be subjects better
relegated to the laboratory and were rarely used for crystallizer design.

The design and analysis of crystallization processes of the continuous well-mixed suspension type have
developed into formal design algorithms which can now be applied in situations of industrial importance.
Specific process configurations that can be modeled rigorously include fines destruction, clear-liquor ad-
vance, Classified-product removal, vessel staging, and seeding. Such process configurations can be modeled
rigorously with a population balance CSD algorithm or, in many cases, with an alternative mass-based
formulation. Crystal size distribution transients and stability can also be evaluated as well as the effects of
size-dependent growth rate and suspension concentration-dependent secondary nucleation. Simulation ca-
pabilities have in fact outstripped the ability to monitor appropriate control variables and to manipulate and
control liquid and solids residence-time distributions in a crystallizing environment.

A considerable amount of skepticism naturally is expressed by crystallization practitioners concerning
the unbridled use of parameters generated in well-controlled small-scale equipment to predict performance
of industrial-scale crystallizers. Many factors contribute to the nonideal behavior of industrial crystallizers,
and not all can be easily explained.

The ability to predict crystal behavior in complex systems is ahead of our ability to manipulate crystal
and liquid residence times. Generalizations of the MSMPR equations have been made to predict CSD with
arbitrary process configurations and kinetics; however, there is no guarantee that an assumed process
residence-time distribution can be physically implemented to produce a customized product CSD. Size
distributions in cascaded crystallizers, for example, multiple-effect evaporators, can be computed if kinetic
