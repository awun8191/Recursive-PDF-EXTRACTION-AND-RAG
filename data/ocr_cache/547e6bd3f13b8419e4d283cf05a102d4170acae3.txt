SECTION A

Comprehension Passage
Instruction: Read the following passage and answer the questions on it.

Africa had been integrated into international cinema circuits since the beginning of cinema—
there were film screenings in Lagos in 1903 (Ekwuazi, 1991). But Africa was integrated on the
worse possible terms. Cinema was a one-way street: Africans watched films but could not make
them for lack of capital to fund productions and because of the complex and expensive training,
infrastructure, and technical apparatus celluloid cinema requires. The films that were imported
were chosen to appeal to the colonial elite or because they were the cheaper thing that could be
“dumped on the market. They were often racists and often estranged from African realities| As
_ Brian Larkin puts it, “until recently, in African postcolonies like Nigeria, a trip to the cinema has
always been translocal, a stepping outside Africa to places elsewhere” (2008, 124). Onookome
Okome relates that when he was growing up in Sapele, in Niger Delta, the Pidgin phrase “na
cinema be dat” (“that’s cinema”) meant that something was unreal, impossible. Nevertheless,
Africans were and are avid filmgoers. Cinemas were one of the prime attractions of urban
modernity. Hollywood movies sank deep into the popular imagination. Africans were subjected
to a second kind of film, besides the commercial imports: the instructional and propaganda films
created for African audiences by the British, French and Belgian colonial film units, which were
taken by mobile cinema vans into villages and neighborhood that had no other experience of
movies. Usually these films were unbearably condescending, but they left an important legacy:
postcolonial African: governments and many filmmakers continue to conceive of cinema (and
television) as a tool for modernizing and shaping society (Larkin 2008, chapter 3; Garritano

2013, Chapter 1).

The scholarships on African cinema, the contrast between French and British mode of support
for cinema in the colonial and postcolonial epochs is a familiar theme (Martin 1982; Diawara
1992; Ukadike 1994; Shaka 2004). The French restricted African film production during the
colonial era but afterwards vigorously provided financing, technicians and noncommercial
distribution channels, resulting in a strong if small corpus of feature films but very little film

SECTION A

Comprehension Passage
Instruction: Read the following passage and answer the questions on it.

“Love” is a word that is on the lips of many people in our world today but,
unfortunately, not in their hearts. It is the theme of the lyrics of most hip-hop, reggae, raga,
pop-funk, blues, secular, spiritual, local, and even international music, to mention but a few.
It is the major or sole preoccupation of most creative works and critical essays of authors like
poets, novelists, and playwrights. Sculptors and other artists also display love with their
crafts. But ironically, most people have little or no correct or complete idea of what the word
actually means. It is thus worthwhile to consider most people’s concepts of love.

Consider a strikingly handsome rich young man who met a breath-taking beautiful
woman for the first time. The man got fascinated by her beauty, wealth and intellect. The
lady too was swept off her feet by the man’s handsomeness, achievements caréer-wise, his
wealth and general charisma. That same day, when they had hardly known each other, they
professed their love for each other. In the next forty hours, they had chatted on the telephone
several minutes running into several hours on several occasions. On the fourth day, they
ended up in bed for a session rounds of rumpy pumpy. But they did not know that the love
they felt for each other was the type they called infatuation based on sheer physical attraction

and sex appeal.

Love could also be platonic. This usually does not begin as love at first sight. The
people concemed are brought together by circumstances of work or any other common
interest in normal living. The longer they stay together, the more they discover more things
that make them fonder of each other. They are urged on by the fact that their relationship is
mutually beneficial. But neither of them harbours any thought of sleeping with the other.

This world order is generally believed to have been created by a Supreme Being .
known as God. God, we are taught, loves all men so amazingly that He does good to all, the
grateful and the ungrateful alike. He loves even the most unlovable and does not withhold His ©


a.

care from the unworthy. ial and unconditional love 7s in ae agape,
the kind of love that God demands exercise 10 all, friends and foes alike.

Our youths need to be well taught about all kinds of love so that they may know the
appropriate way to show love, (and) the approptiate kind of love.... Many youths have
inadvertently transmitted wrong messages that landed them: 1 big troubles. Many ladies have
thrown their pearls to the swine that trampled the precious jewels because they were amateurs
or even complete novices in matters of love. And this must be avoided at all cost.

Section A
Comprehension Passage
Instruction: Carefully read the passage below and answer the questions set on it.

‘The historiography of precolonial Igbo society, that is, of Igboland before ca.
1990,' relies on a variety of sources and methodologies: linguistic and archaeological
research, oral narratives and the products of their transformation into written accounts
during the twentieth century, ethnographic and social anthropological studies (on political
and kinship institutions, performances, and the arts), and’a very limited number of written
accounts by European visitors since the mid-nineteenth century.

Historical linguistics provides the earliest \evel of historical analysis. The Igbo
language belongs to the Kwa subfamily of the larger Niger-Congo language family;
glottochronology points to a point in time about 6,000 years ago when Igbo separated
from proto-Kwa, assumed to be spoken in the Niger-Benue confluence area. Igbo has
numerous dialectics. Variations in spelling grammar, or word use are common even
among neighbouring villages, creating 4 continuum of dialectical variation in Igboland
that restricts mutual intelligibility among speakers of distant dialects. The Igbo literary
standard developed since the late colonial period... became only partially successful as a
written vernacular; the Igbo educated elite continues to prefer English to written Igbo as
means of communication even among itself, within the large number of dialectics— Pat
Ndukwe (1992: 664) mentions estimates from 100 to 300, thereby indicating the
uncertainty of classification 4 smaller number of major Igbo linguistics about them.”
The linguistic evidence, over all, points at diversity in [gboland.

Archaeology has provided information about the history © settlements technology
and_trade. Neolithic farming communities settled in [gboland at least from 1000 BCE
onward (Chikwendu 1992: 72-74). Early concentrations of populations, with developed
ceramic production, have been indentified around Nsukka and Afikpo, but due to the
sketchy evidence it remains unclear whether these were isolated centers OF examples of a
more general expansion of neolithic culture (Chikwendu 1992: 87-90). The famous
archaeological finds at |gbo-Ukwu (Anambra State) showed that there was a society with
