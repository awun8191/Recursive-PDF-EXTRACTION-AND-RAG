SECTION A

Comprehension Passage
Fastruction: Read the following passoge and answer the questions on it

“Love” ig a word that is on the lips ef many people in our world foday but,
unfortunately, not in their Hearts, [tis the theme of the lyrics of most hip-hop, reggae, raga,
pop-funks, blues, secular, spiritual, focal, and even international music, ta mentiva bet s few.
It is the majar or 30'e preoccupation of most creative works and criticn! essays of euthors like
ports, uovelists, and playwrights Sculptors and ether mists also display Jove with their
crafts. B ic se no corect or complete idea of what the wore!
is chus t peagle’s concepts of love.

Consider 2 strtkiegly baudsee rich young sion whe met g breath-taking heautifi!
wornan for we first dine, Une man gos foscinated by her beauty, wealth ond intetlect, The
lacy lou was swept off har feet Wy the znan’s Sondsomentss. uchisvements cacet-wise, hls
weatth ood general cferisec. That same day, when they bis) bardiy Known each over, Mey
for each other. In the nexi forty hours, they had chatted on the velephone
om several occasions. Oa the fours day, they

professed Uicir love
severe! minutes running intu several hours
ended up in bed for & session sounds of rumpy pumpy. Tus tory did net know that the love
they feli for each other was the type they called infamation based on sheer physical aiyaction

and sex appeal,

Love could also be platonic. This wsually does not begyn as love at first sight, The
people concerted are Dronghi togethar by circumstances of work or any other common
interest in normal living. The longer they stay together, the tore they discover mare things
thay make them fonder of cach other, They arc urged on by the fact that their celstionship is
mutually beneficial, But neither of therm harbours any thoughs of steeping with the other.

This world order is generally believed to have been created by a Supreme Being
sey Ged. God, beste ons tanweht, loves all men 90 amazingly that He does good to all, the
grateful und the ungratetul alike, He loves even the aiost untovahle and does not withhold His


‘ na te< d's) we
at {t<. OF)

care from the unworthy. This self-sacrificial and unconditional love is known aa agape, It ts
the kind of fove that God demunds that we exercise to all, frends and foes alske.

Our youths need to be well taught about all kinds of love so that they may know the
appropriate way to show love, (and) the appropriate kind of love,.... Many youths have
inadvertently transmilted wrong messages that landed them in big troubles. Many ladies have
thrown their pearls to the swine that trampled the precious jewels because they were amateurs
or even complete novices in matters of love. And this mast be avaided at all cost.

Many youths have also unwitfingly given their consent to be used and dumped by
smart people who had been consumed by infateation but not genunne love. But a youth who
can identify and interpret the telltale signs of infaruation and diffeventiate it from the
characteristics af tue love would take weit informed caution. So, it is advisable to teach the
youths the principles of love in onder to avoid being exploited by insincere it merely

inferuated wolves who feign love,

Embezzlement of public funds, mpe, armed robbery, ritual killing and other vices that
are destroying nations are offshoots of tack of love fer others, One may mnt expect mcs
positive change through the activities of governmental and non-goveranental organisations
becanse the hest of their efforts can be likened to cutting an unwanted tres from the branches.

Rut snecessfully teaching our people about love would uproot the vices from their hearts wed
minds and thus help us attuin peace,
