BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATIONS AND REFERENCING
Introduction

Citation is a reference or footnote to a document which contains sufficient information to
identify and locate the work to which it refers. It usually takes the form of
a Bibliographic reference.

Bibliographic reference is the information necessary to identify a document. It
normally includes: author; title; place of publication, publisher, and date (in the case of a
book); or author; title; name of journal; volume/edition, page number(s), and date (in the
case of an article).

Bibliographic referencing can therefore be defined as a full listing of all materials
consulted in relation to a research, study or write-up, including any source material not
directly cited in the text, placed at the end of the document.

Reasons for Citing Sources

i. Citing sources is the paramount way to use other authors’ works without violating
copyright law.

li. Citations allow readers to locate and further explore the sources you consulted,
show the depth and scope of your research, and give credit to authors for their
intellectual work.

iii. Citations provide viable evidence for your arguments and add integrity to your
work by showing that you have sought out and considered a variety of resources.

iv. Citing sources gives your research, articles, presentation, conference paper, theses,
and dissertations a global acceptability and recognition.

Styles of Citation

The following three major styles are used in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and some
scientific disciplines:

i. APA Style (American Psychological Association), from the American
Psychological Association, often preferred in the fields of Psychology, and many
other Social Sciences.

ill.

MLA Style (Modern Language Association), from the Modern Language
Association of America, often preferred in the fields of Literature, Arts,
Humanities and some other disciplines.

Chicago Style, from the University of Chicago Press, often preferred in History
and many other disciplines. (“Turabian” style derives from this and is very similar
to it in many ways).

Difference between Bibliography and Reference

Bibliography: A bibliography is any list of resources or materials at the end of the text,
whether cited or not but consulted. It includes additional text you read but not directly
used in the course of writing the text, it serves as additional background reading.

Reference: References usually come at the end of a study or write-up and research work.
It usually contains only those works or resources cited within the text.
