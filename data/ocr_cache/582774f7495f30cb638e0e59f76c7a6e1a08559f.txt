Library Materials

Types of Library Materials

Library materials can be grouped into three, namely: print materials, non-print materials and
electronic resources.

Print materials: are those that have information printed on papers.
Print materials can be categorized into three (3), namely: books, reference materials and serials.

yearbook, biography, handbook, almanac, gazetteer, indexes and abstract e.t.c.

Classes of Reference Materials

magazines, reports, newspapers, minutes of meeting among others.

Non-print materials: these are information materials that are not in printed form. They can be

who may be able to take advantage of such information. It is based on a user interest
profile. It is rendered to the user through preferred medium which could be by emails,
phone calls, fax, and social media. This type of service is very common in special/
