INVERTEBRATE 
INTRODUCTION: The invertebrates are animals without backbone and they constitute about 
90 per cent of known animals which number over a million. There are about 30 phyla. The 
members of each phylum are constructed on common anatomical features, similar functions 
and have common ancestry. The invertebrate phyla are divided into two; major and minor 
phyla based on two factors (i) the number of species and individuals, (ii) Their participation 
in ecological communities. They can also be referred to as Lower and Higher invertebrates. 
The lower invertebrates are simple in body organization and generally smaller in size e.g. 
protozoa, porifera, Nematoda while the higher invertebrates are generally large in size and 
have a complex body organization e.g. Mollusca, Annelida, Echinodermata. 
CHARACTERISTICS OF INVERTEBRATES 
 They originated in the sea but most of them have successfully invaded the land or its 
freshwater habitats. 
 95 per cent of known living species of animals are invertebrates. 
 Invertebrates exhibit varied body shapes- irregular ever-changing body shape, plant-
like appearance and ribbon shaped, vermiform, and star-shaped. 
 They exhibit a great variation in size from microscopic protozoan to large-sized 
cephalopods. 
 They exhibit all types of symmetries-bilateral, radial, biradial, spherical etc. 
 Invertebrates display all grades of organization-protoplasmic grade, cellular grade, 
cell-tissue grade, tissue-organ grade, organ-system grade. 
 Invertebrates except protozoan are diploblastic or triploblastic. 
 The body covering of invertebrates is simple. Plasma membrane in protozoa and 
protective pellicle in some. Most have an outer protective epidermis which is made of 
single layer of cells while others have further added a non-cellular cuticle secreted by 
underlying epidermis. 
 They have multiple movement devices-some are sessile while others move from place 
to place using pseudopodia, flagella, cilia, contractile myonemes, setae, parapodia, 
suckers, jointed legs etc. 
 The members of several invertebrate phyla are characterized by segmentation in their 
bodies. Flatworms show pseudosegmentation while Annelida and Arthropoda exhibit 
true segmentation. 
 They are generally soft-bodied animals without a rigid internal skeleton for the 
attachment of muscles. They have no endoskeleton though molluscs and arthropods 
have hard exoskeleton. 
 They are grouped based on the presence of coelom as aceolomate, pseudocoelomate 
or coelomate. 
 The alimentary canal is either absent or partially formed or complete and when 
present, it is dorsal to the nerve cord, running from the anterior to the posterior. 
 Digestion is both intracellular and extracellular in invertebrate depending on their 
phyla. 
 Digestive systems are vacuolar and channel-network systems, as well as more 
specialized saccular (resembling sac) and tubular systems. 
 Invertebrates exhibit diversified respiratory system-diffusion, gills, branchiae, tube 
feet, and respiratory trees. 
 They have diversified excretory mechanisms-diffusion through cell membranes, flame 
cells, nephridia, malphigian tubules. 

 Invertebrate nervous system is characterized by solid nerves; these are not hollow 
from within. 
 They exhibit varied modes of reproduction-asexual binary fission, sexual, 
hermaphrodites. 
 All invertebrates are cold-blooded.   
Invertebrates are broadly classified into two via PROTOZOA and METAZOA. 
Protozoa are the most primitive animals; they are considered first evolved animals. They are 
mostly are mostly microscopic in size and solitary. They are generally aquatic found in 
freshwater or marine water, wet soil or in the body of other animals when they occur as 
parasites. Protozoa are unicellular animals of small size, they have a permeable limiting 
membrane which prevents the animals from growing beyond a certain size, and it precludes 
the formation of structures which will give strength and rigidity necessary for large size. But 
more important than strength is the factor that the activities of protozoa involve an exchange 
of substances between their protoplasm and their surrounding liquid medium. Division of 
labour in protozoa occurs at organelle level which is sub-cellular structures for different 
functions. In protozoa, the small cellular body performs all vital functions, and no single 
function predominates over the others. Generally a single nucleus occurs in protozoa; 
however, some have more than one nucleus. It is believed that multi-cellular animals evolved 
from multinucleated and colonial protozoa. 
Metazoa are  large holozoic multicellular animals  in which limitations of size  are removed 
and their cells are potentially capable of performing all essential  vital activities, but the cells 
are dependent on each other and all of them are not similar because specialization has taken 
place. This has opened up vast possibilities for an increased complexity of body form and 
structure. Cell specialization in turn has led to the development of tissues in which groups of 
similar cells are organized into layers. Metazoans are multicellular animals which are 
distinguished not only by their larger size, but by a high degree of differentiation and 
specialization of their parts.  
Lower metazoa are unsegmented, radially or bilaterally symmetrical, diploblastic or 
triploblastic, and acoelomate or pseudocoelomate. The phyla Porifera,Coelentrata, 
Platyhelminthes and Aschelminthes  are LOWER METAZOA while Mollusca, Annelida, 
Arthropoda, Echinodermata are HIGHER METAZOA.  
 
 
PHYLUM PROTOZOA 
 
Euglena viridis: It is a solitary free-living freshwater flagellate. It occurs in freshwater-ponds, 
pools, ditches and slowly moving streams-and brackish water rich in organic matter. Some 
species develop large populations as red or green “blooms” in lakes or ponds. It is elongated 
and spindle-shaped in appearance. The anterior end is blunt; the middle part is wider while 
the posterior end is pointed. From the anterior end arises a whip-like flagellum which is seen 
moving when the Euglena is proceeding forward. The body is covered by pellicle or periplast 
which lies beneath the plasma membrane. Several species produce resting that can withstand 
drying. The colorless species can be used to study cell growth and metabolism in various 
environmental conditions.  

Its cytoplasm is differentiated into an outer layer of ECTOPLASM and inner layer of 
ENDOPLAM. The ectoplasm is thin, clear or non-granular, while the endoplasm is more 
fluid-like and granular. The endoplasm contains the nucleus, chromatophores, paramylum 
bodies, Golgi bodies, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and the ribosome. 
                       
 
LOCOMOTION: There are two types of movement in Euglena –(i) flagella movement and 
(ii) euglenoid movement. Using its flagellum, it swims freely in water, takes a spiral course 
and rotates on its axis. In euglenoid movement, the flexible pellicle enables it to perform 
peristaltic activity which brings about worm-like wriggling movement while the animal 
creeps on the bottom. 
NUTRITION: It exhibits MIXOTROPHIC mode of nutrition. It feeds holophytically by the 
means of the chlorophyll in its chromatophores and holozoically through its body surface. 
RESPIRATION & EXCRETION: These are by diffusion through the body surface. 
OSMOREGULATION: Euglena has a semi-permeable membrane and lives in water, so 
water continuously enters its body by ENDOSMOSIS. Excess water is removed by the 
contractile vacuoles. 
REPRODUCTION: It reproduces asexually by binary fission and multiple fissions. 
Encystment also takes place. 
Binary fission occurs in favorable conditions. The nucleus divides into two by mitosis and 
later followed by the division of the cytoplasm which starts at the anterior region. 
Multiple fissions occur in unfavorable conditions. Large number of Euglenae come together, 
loses their flagella and become rounded. They secrete gelatinous covering within which they 
remain embedded. This condition is called PALMELLA STAGE. Individuals of palmella 
stage carry on metabolic activities and reproduce by binary fission. In favorable, the Euglena 
regenerate their flagella and start normal active life. 

ENCYSTMENT: This takes place as a protective measure to get over unfavourable 
conditions. A thick cyst wall is secreted around the animal which is now inactive and lost its 
flagellum. It remains in this condition until favourable conditions return. During this period, 
it can undergo binary fission once or more times. 
BEHAVIOUR: Euglena responds to a variety of stimuli and is very sensitive to light. It 
swims towards an ordinary light and avoid strong light. It gives avoiding reaction to 
mechanical, thermal and chemical stimuli on a trial and error pattern. 
It shows many characters of plants such as chloroplasts with chlorophyll and holophytic 
nutrition but it is regarded as an animal due to the following facts. 
 Absence of cellulose cell-wall overlying the plasma membrane. 
 Its pellicle is made of proteins and not cellulose as in plants. 
 Presence of centrioles forming the blepharoplasts or kinetosomes. 
 Presence of stigma and paraflagellar body, the photosensitive structures. 
 Reserve food is paramylum which is not a true starch. 
 Presence of contractile vacuoles, which are not found in plants. 
 Nutrition is holozoic as in animals. 
 Presence of longitudinal binary fission, which is not found in plants. 
 Presence of flagella and ability to move around.  
 Presence of eyespot. 
 
Amoeba proteus: It is widely distributed, found commonly in bottom mud in freshwater 
ponds, pools, ditches, lakes and slow streams and damp soils. It occurs in abundance in the 
water which contains bacteria and organic substances such as leaves, twigs and other aquatic 
vegetation in abundance. There are many parasitic amoebae. For example, Entamoeba 
histolytica causes amoebic dysentery. 
It is a unicellular microscopic organism with an irregular and constantly changing shape due 
to the formation of finger-like processes, the PSEUDOPODIA or LOPODIA. It has no cell-
wall but a thin delicate outer membrane-PLASMALEMMA; beneath which is a non-granular 
layer, the ECTOPLASM which encloses the granular ENDOPLASM.  The endoplasm 
contains the nucleus, contractile vacuole, food vacuole, water globules and other endoplasmic 
organelles. 

 
LOCOMOTION: Movement is by the pseudopodia which are formed as a result of the 
flowing of the cytoplasm. 
NUTRITION: Mode of nutrition is holozoic. There is no mouth and nutrition involves 
ingestion, digestion, assimilation, dissimulation and egestion. Ingestion can be by 
circumvallation, circumfluence, import, invagination and pinocytosis. Digestion takes place 
in the food vacuole and it is intracellular. The digested food is absorbed by surrounding 
protoplasm is by diffusion. The living protoplasm is broken down by oxidation to produce 
heat, kinetic energy and waste products by dissimilation. Egestion of undigested particles 
occurs at no fixed point; they pass out at any point on the surface through no special opening. 
Amoeba Engulfing a Paramecium 
Below is an amoeba, a single-celled organism lacking internal organs, is shown approaching 
a much smaller paramecium, which it begins to engulf with large out-flowing of its 
cytoplasm, called pseudopodia. Once the paramecium is completely engulfed, a primitive 
digestive cavity, called a vacuole, forms around it. In the vacuole, acids break the 
paramecium down into chemicals that the amoeba can diffuse back into its cytoplasm for 
nourishment. 
 
  

 
 
RESPIRATION & EXCRETION: They are both done by diffusion through the semi-
permeable plasmalemma. Contractile vacuole also helps in excretion. This feature is absent in 
marine and parasitic forms. 
 
REPRODUCTION: Amoeba proteus reproduces asexually by binary fission, multiple fission 
and sporulation. Above is the single-celled amoeba demonstrates a simple method of asexual 
reproduction; it divides in half by a process called fission, producing two smaller daughter 
cells. After a period of feeding and growth, these two daughter cells will themselves divide in 
half. 
OSMOREGULATION: This is done by the contractile vacuole.  

BEHAVIOUR: It responds to various kinds of stimuli either positively or negatively though 
it has no special structures for the reception of stimuli. 
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF AMOEBA 
 It depicts organization of protoplasmic mass or a single cell into a complete organism. 
 Binary fission provides a clear-cut understanding of the mitotic division of a cell. 
 Its responses or taxes represent the early beginning of sensitivity in animals. 
 The larger number of chromosomes present in the nucleus suggests the occurrence of 
isolated genes, which in higher animals are located in chromosomes. 
  It provides a faint idea regarding the anatomical structures of higher animals. For 
example, the food cup is comparable to the buccal cavity, food vacuole to gut, 
pseudopodia to legs, contractile vacuole to urinary bladder etc.   
 It helps in understanding the relationship and interactions between the nucleus and the 
cytoplasm. 
                    
Paramecium caudatum: Paramecium is found in freshwater ponds, pools, ditches, streams, 
rivers, lakes, reservoirs etc. and especially in waters rich decaying organic matters. It is a 
microscopic slipper-shaped or spindle-shaped, asymmetrical organisms. The body is 
elongated, blunt and rounded at the anterior end and pointed at the posterior end. The body is 
covered by a thin, double layered, elastic and firm pellicle made of gelatin. The pellicle holds 
the animal in shape but it’s elastic enough to permit contractions.  
The inner membrane of the pellicle continues with the cytoplasm and the outer membrane 
with the cilia. The cytoplasm is divided into ECTOPLASM and ENDOPLASM. The 
endoplasm contains the nuclei and other organelles. 
A paramecium has two contractile vacuoles located close to the surface near the ends of the 
cell. They function in regulating the water content within the cell and may also be considered 
excretory structures since the expelled water contains metabolic wastes. 
Paramecia have two kinds of nuclei: a large ellipsoidal nucleus called a macronucleus and at 
least one small nucleus called a micronucleus. Both types of nuclei contain the full 
complement of genes that bear the hereditary information of the organism. The organism 
cannot survive without the macronucleus; it cannot reproduce without the micronucleus. The 
macronucleus is the centre of all metabolic activities of the organism. The micronucleus is a 
storage site for the genetic material of the organism. It gives rise to the macronucleus and is 
responsible for the genetic reorganization that occurs during conjugation (cross-fertilization). 
  

 
 
Paramecium Anatomy 
A paramecium is a microscopic, slipper-shaped organism that lives in fresh waters 
throughout the world. It has a tough outer covering known as a pellicle. About 2,500 tiny, 
hair-like projections, called cilia, extend from the pellicle; the cilia move back and forth like 
oars to help the paramecium move about. The paramecium eats tiny organisms, such as 
bacteria that are swept by the cilia into an indentation in the cytostome, called the oral 
groove. The organisms are eventually passed into a food vacuole, a small, round structure 
where food is digested, and are then passed into the cytoplasm. The contractile vacuole 
regulates osmotic pressure within the organism. The macronucleus is involved in protein 
synthesis and other cellular activities, while the micronucleus functions in sexual 
reproduction. 
                                                                                                       
LOCOMOTION:  It moves by metaboly or body contortions and by cilia which beat forwards 
o backwards enabling the animal to swim anterior or posterior. Cilia are used in locomotion 
and during feeding. When moving through the water, paramecia follow a spiral path while 
rotating on the long axis. When a paramecium encounters an obstacle, it exhibits the so-called 
avoidance reaction: It backs away at an angle and starts off in a new direction. 
NUTRITION: It is holozoic and the animal feeds on bacteria and minute protozoa which are 
swept into the oral groove by the cilia. The cilia beat rhythmically to direct bacteria and other 
food particles into their mouths. Within the gullet, food particles are transformed into food 
vacuoles, and digestion takes place within each food vacuole. The food vacuoles follow a definite 
course within the body, and feces are regularly expelled at the point, which is therefore known as the 
potential anus. During cyclosis, digestion occurs by enzymes secreted by protoplasm into the 
vacuole. 
RESPIRATION & EXCRETION: These take place by diffusion through the semi-permeable 
pellicle. In addition, contractile vacuoles help in excretion. 
Osmo-regulation is by the two contractile vacuoles. The animal responds either positively or 
negatively depending on the stimuli. 

REPRODUCTION: It reproduces asexually by binary fission and also undergoes several 
types of nuclear reorganization via, conjugation. Ordinarily paramecium multiplies by binary 
fission for a long period of time, but at intervals this may be interrupted by the joining of two 
animals along their oral surfaces for sexual process of conjugation. 
 . Two paramecia fuse as conjugants. 
 Macronuclei degenerate and micronuclei divide. 
 Micronuclei divide again. 
 Three out of four nuclei in each conjugant disappear. 
 The remaining nucleus divides unequally. 
 The smaller pronuclei are exchanged. 
 The two pronuclei in each unite to form the zygote nucleus. 
 The paramecia separate as ex-conjugants 
 
 Zygote nucleus divides three times to form 8 nuclei. 
 Four become macronuclei, three disappear and one remains micronucleus. 
 Micronucleus and Paramecium divides twice to yield four paramecia from each 
conjugant 
 
Plasmodium vivax: It is a protozoan parasite of man and it lives as an intracellular parasite in 
the red blood corpuscles (RBCs) of man as mature adult called TROPHOZOITE. 
Four species of Plasmodium parasites cause malaria in humans: Plasmodium falciparum, P. 
vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae. Each causes a different form of the disease. P. vivax and P. 
ovale cause the mildest forms; P. falciparum, the severest and most deadly form. Other 
Plasmodium species infect primates, rodents, birds, and lizards. Several of these species, 
particularly those that infect rodents, have been used in experimental studies and for testing 
malaria drugs and vaccines.  
The trophozoite is amoeboid, uni-nucleated having vacuolated and granular cytoplasm. It has 
a double membrane, the plasmalemma closely applied to the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm 
contains some organelles. 
The mode of nutrition is saprozoic, occurs by OSMOTROPHY. Organ of locomotion, 
contractile vacuole, etc are not found. Respiration takes place anaerobically. 
 Reproduction is both asexually and sexually. Plasmodium species exhibit three life-cycle 
stages—gametocytes, sporozoites, and merozoites. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

LIFE CYCLE 
 
  
 
Life Cycle of the Malaria Parasite 
 
The life cycle of plasmodium vivax is DIGENETIC. The parasite is transmitted to humans by 
the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito. The Plasmodium parasite spends its life cycle 
partly in humans and partly in mosquitoes. Asexual phase is completed in man by 
SCHIZOGONY (differentiated into EXOERYTHROCYTIC SCHIZOGONY involving pre- 
and post-erythrocytic schizogonic cycles, and erythrocytic schizogony ) and  sexual phase of 
its life cycle is completed in female Anopheles mosquito by GAMETOGONY, SYNGAMY,  
SPOROGONY. 
(A) Mosquito infected with the malaria parasite bites human, passing cells called sporozoites 
/into the human’s bloodstream. (B) Sporozoites travel to the liver. Each sporozoite undergoes 
asexual reproduction (multiple fission), in which its nucleus splits to form two new cells, 
called merozoites. (C) Merozoites enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells. (D) In red 
blood cells, merozoites grow and divide to produce more merozoites, eventually causing the 
red blood cells to rupture. Some of the newly released merozoites go on to infect other red 
blood cells. (E) Some merozoites develop into sex cells known as male and female 
gametocytes known as macrogametocytes and microgametocytes respectively. This process is 
called GAMETOGONY. (F) Another mosquito bites the infected human, ingesting the 
gametocytes. (G) In the mosquito’s stomach, the gametocytes mature. Male and female 
gametocytes undergo sexual reproduction, uniting to form a zygote (SYNGAMY). The 
zygote remains motionless for sometimes and later becomes active as OOKINETE. The 
ookinete penetrates the wall of the stomach of the insect and lies beneath the outer epithelial 
layer and become encysted as OOCYST. The oocyst by meiosis and mitotic division 
produces the SPOROZOITES and bursts to liberate them into the haemolymph of the insect 
where they reach the salivary glands. (H) The sporozoites will infect a human host when 
bitten by mosquito and the cycle starts again. 
 

SYMPTOMS OF MALARIA 
Symptoms of malaria generally begin from 7 to 15 days after a bite from an infectious 
mosquito—about the time when the red blood cells burst. The bursting cells release wastes 
and toxins (poisonous substances) along with merozoites. Fever develops as the immune 
system responds to the toxins in the blood.  
The fever that characterizes malaria usually occurs in periodic attacks—every 72 hours from 
infection with P. malariae and every 48 hours from infection with the others. An attack 
begins with chills and shivering, soon followed by a high fever. Sweating then brings the 
temperature down. These attacks usually leave an individual exhausted. Headaches, nausea 
and vomiting, and achiness may also accompany the fever and chills. Anemia may occur as a 
result of the bursting and destruction of red blood cells.  
Severe cases of malaria can affect the brain and other organs, as blood cells infected with the 
parasite stick to the walls of tiny blood vessels and block the flow of blood and oxygen. In 
the brain, the condition can develop into cerebral malaria and lead to coma and, if not treated, 
to death. If the kidneys are affected, kidney failure may follow.  
A diagnosis of malaria is usually made by examining a sample of the patient’s blood under 
the microscope for the presence of malaria parasites in the red cells.

PHYLUM PORIFERA 
 
Sponges are by far the simplest multi-cellular animals and are very different from all the 
others. They have no fixed body shape, no plane of symmetry .The porifera may be referred 
to as asymmetrical or racially symmetrical multicellular organisms with cellular grade of 
organization without well defined tissues and organs; exclusively aquatic; mostly marine, 
sedentary, solitary or colonial animals with body perforated pores, canals and chamber 
through which water flows; with one or more internal cavities lined with choanocytes; and 
with characteristic skeleton made of calcareous spicules, siliceous spicules or horny fibers of 
sponging. 
 
What are the distinguishing characters of sponges? 
 
Sponges are sessile and immobile, having neither nerves nor muscles. There may be slight 
contractility round the larger pores but it is very restricted.  
 
Sponge cell types are the distinctive collar cells or ‘choanocytes’, the ‘pinacocytes’ that make 
an outer layer and the ‘amoebocytes’ wandering through the central jelly or ‘mesohyl.’ This 
jelly is needed for support; in contrast to other animals, neighboring cells are not bound 
together by a basement membrane 
 
Small pores perforate the whole body (the name of the phylum, Porifera, means ‘pore 
bearing.’ Water carrying food particles enters the body by many small pores (‘Ostia’), moved 
in by the beating of the flagella of the internal collar cells. These cells extract food particles 
from the water, which flows out through larger pores, the ‘oscula.’ This arrangement, with 
the principal openings exhalant, is unique to sponges. 
 
The skeleton is made of spicules of calcite (a calcium salt) or silica (a silicon salt) with or 
without a matrix of horny collagen-type protein. Such use of silica is a unique feature. An 
unusually wide range of skeletal materials occurs among closely related species of sponges. 
Animal skeletons, whether hard or hydrostatic (based on the incompressibility of water) 
usually translate muscle contraction into movement. Sponges, however, have no muscles and 
the supporting skeleton instead serves to prevent movement from occurring. Spicules have 
further important functions in preserving the sponge’s shape, keeping the pores open and 
maintaining the internal channels (as well as making the sponge even nastier to eat than it 
probably would be anyway). 
 
They have characterized canal systems. 
 
Color among sponges is variable. 
 
 
 
KINDS OF SPONGES 
 
The phylum Porifera may be divided into three classes on the basis of the composition of the 
skeletal elements-the Calcispongiae and Hyalospongiae include about 20 percent of the 
known species of sponges; the remainder are placed in the class Demospongiae. 
 

Calcarea, with calcareous spicules. They occur in shallow waters (less than 100 metres). 
Examples are Leucosolenia. 
 
Demospongiae, with siliceous spicules. Examples are Halichondria, Oscarella the 
breadcrumb sponge, and Spongia, the once commonly used bath sponge, in which there are 
no spicules but only protein fibres. 
. 
Hexactinellida, the ‘glass sponges’ are very different from other sponges. They consist of a 
small group in the deep sea (below 200 metres); their growth is orientated to the constant 
water currents there. Example are Hexactinella, Euplectella.

TYPE OF CANAL SYSTEMS IN SPONGES 
 
The essential elements of the water-current system include the pores, or ostia, through which 
water enters the sponge (incurrent system); the choanocytes, or collar cells, which are 
flagellated cells that capture food; and the oscula, openings through which water is expelled 
(excurrent system). Three types of water-current systems of increasingly complex structure 
may be distinguished by the arrangement of choanocytes and the development of canals—
ascon, sycon, and leucon. The simplest, or ascon, type, found only in certain primitive genera 
of Calcispongiae (e.g., Leucosolenia), is characterized by an arrangement of choanocytes 
around a central cavity that directly communicates with the osculum. The walls of these 
sponges are thin, lack canals, and are perforated by pores, which actually are openings 
through cells (porocytes). The sycon type of water-current system, found also in 
Calcispongiae is at first characterized by choanocytes that surround fingerlike projections 
called radial canals of the sponge wall. Water enters the radial canals directly through pores, 
makes its way into the central cavity, or spongocoel, and leaves by way of an osculum. In 
most syconoid sponges (e.g., Scypha) the radial canals are bordered by incurrent canals 
through which passes the water entering the pores; other openings (prosopyles) allow water 
into the choanocytes, from which it passes directly into the internal cavity and out of it 
through the osculum. In the leucon type, which is found in the more advanced Calcispongiae 
and in the other classes (Demospongiae and Hyalospongiae), the radial canals are replaced by 
numerous small flagellated chambers in which the choanocytes are localized; the chambers, 
scattered throughout the body of the sponge, have pores through which water passes into a 
complex system of incurrent canals, then into a spongocoel (internal cavity) by way of 
excurrent canals. Water enters very small pores found among the cells (pinacocytes), which 
line the outer surface of the sponge. After passing through a system of incurrent canals and 
cavities, also lined with pinacocytes, the water reaches the flagellated chambers, enters them 
through openings (prosopyles), and leaves through other openings (apopyles). The water is 
expelled through the osculum after passing through a system of excurrent canals and cavities 
lined with pinacocytes. During the development of many sponges, a simpler water current 
system (rhagon) precedes the leucon type. The rhagon type is characterized by reduced 
excurrent canals and by a large central cavity. In some Demospongiae the body is organized 
in two parts, an external ectosome without choanocytes, and an internal choanosome with 
choanocytes.  
 
 
FEEDING AND DIGESTION 
 
The Porifera are filter feeders, utilizing food particles suspended in the water and captured by 
the choanocytes. Food particles consist essentially of bacteria, other microorganisms, and 
particles of organic debris; sponges also probably absorb dissolved organic substances. 
Intracellular digestion occurs in both choanocytes and thesocytes. A large quantity of food is 
absorbed by a sponge, and it can use several litres of water a day. The water-current system, 
therefore, is efficient, in spite of the lack of a nervous coordinating centre. The water flow 
into and out of the sponge is maintained by continuous movement of the flagella of the 
choanocytes; flagellar movement pushes water into the choanocyte chambers, creating in 
them a pressure that extends to the excurrent canals, as water passing into the pores is drawn 
along the system of incurrent canals. Water flow, which is also regulated by contraction and 
expansion of the pores and of the oscula, is slow at the pores, fast at the oscula; as a result, 
water expelled with force through the oscula cannot contaminate water entering the pores. 
Toxic or irritating substances cause the pores to close.

RESPIRATION AND EXCRETION 
Respiratory organs are lacking in sponges; oxygen is supplied by a direct exchange between 
the tissues and the surrounding water. Consequently, the consumption of oxygen is related to 
the velocity of the current. Excretion occurs through both the oscula and the surface of the 
sponge. Special amoebocytes disintegrate in the mesohyl, and their granules are expelled 
through the canals. The excretory products of the sponges—ammonia and other nitrogen-
containing substances—account for their characteristic unpleasant odour. 
 
 
REPRODUCTION IN SPONGES 
Most sponges reproduce sexually, although asexual reproduction may occur. Sponges are 
generally hermaphroditic (male and female germ cells in one animal); sometimes dichogamy, 
in which male and female germ cells develop at different times in the same animals, occurs.  
Asexual reproduction also occurs in sponges in various ways; the best known method is 
called gemmulation. Gemmulation begins when aggregates of cells, mostly archaeocytes, 
which, when they become laden with reserve food granules, are called thesocytes, become 
isolated at the surface of a sponge and are then called gemmules. These are expelled from the 
adult sponge and, in some marine species, serve as a normal reproductive process or 

sometimes, as a means to carry the sponges over periods of unfavourable conditions when the 
adults degenerate; e.g., drought, temperature extremes.  
In sexual reproduction, the fertilization of an egg by a spermatozoan is peculiar in sponges in 
that a spermatozoan, after its release from a sponge, is carried by the water current until it is 
captured by a specialized cell called a choanocyte, or collar cell, in another sponge; the 
choanocyte transforms into an amoeba-shaped cell called a carrier cell, which gives up the 
spermatozoan to an egg, lying near a chamber formed by choanocytes and containing long 
lash-like appendages called flagella. 
Development of the embryo may occur in one of several ways characteristic of the different 
groups; as a result, more than one type of larva is found. The characteristic larva of the 
Calcispongiae and of some Demospongiae called an amphiblastula, is oval in shape and has a 
cavity in the middle; the front half of the larva consists of cylindrical, flagellated cells, the 
other half of round cells without flagella. The larva swims with the flagellated portion 
forward. The amphiblastula is preceded by a stage (stomoblastula) in which the central cavity 
of a hollow mass of cells (blastula) opens outward and is surrounded by round granular cells 
(macromere), which are distinguished from other cells with flagella (micromere). The most 
common larval form among the Demospongiae is called a parenchymella; it is solid and 
compact, with an outer layer of flagellated cells and an inner mass of cells. 
A larva swims for a period of time that may vary from a few hours to a few days before it 
descends to find a surface suitable for attachment. 
  
Leucosolenia: It is a small delicate, sessile, delicate branching, colonial marine sponge found 
growing in shallow water below low-tide mark on sea shore rocks where wave actions are 
intense and is not found in calm water. 
The colony of Leucosolenia is whitish or yellowish in colour and it consists of radially 
symmmtrical, vase-like vertical tube-like individuals each ending in an OSCULUM and 
united at their base by horizontal tubes and attached to the substratum by ADHESIVE 
DISCS. The body wall is thin and consists of an outer epidermis, the PINACODERM and an 
inner endodermis, the CHOANODERM separated by a jelly-like non-cellular layer of 
MESENCHYME or MESOGLOEA, enclosing a central cavity, the SPONGOCOEL. The 
wall of each tube is perforated by pores through which water enters the spongocoel and pass 
out by osculum. The pinacoderm consists of thin, scale-like, flattened cells, called 
PINACOCYTES while the choanoderm consists of CHOANOCYTES that form the lining of 
the spongocoel (gastrodermis). The mesenchyme contains spicules that constitute the 
endoskeleton that supports and protects the soft parts of the body and amoebocytes that 
perform variety of functions essential to the life of the sponge. 
The wall of each tube is pierced by numerous pores called OSTIA or incurrent pores which 
pass through a space of cell called POROCYTES. Each ostium is intracellular i.e., it is a 
canal through a single, large, tubular and highly contractile porocyte cell communicating 
outside with the spongocoel. 
No adult sponge is capable of locomotion. They are devoid of sensory or nerve cells. The 
flow of water into the ostia and out through the osculum brings food and provides 
opportunity for gaseous exchange and the elimination of metabolic wastes. Digestion is 
intracellular as in protozoa. Respiration is by diffusion. 

REPRODUCTION: It is both asexually and sexually. Leucosolenia reproduces by 
BUDDING. It also has power of REGENERATION. Sexual reproduction takes place by the 
formation of gametes. Leucosolenia is hermaphrodite  but no gonads. The gametes are 
formed by the differentiation of amoebocyte cells. Fertilization is internal. The fertilized egg 
undergoes equal and holoblastic cleavage to form blastula, called COELOBLASTULA and 
later become the STEREOGASTRULA or PARENCHYMULA. The PARENCHYMULA 
swims freely for sometimes before it gets itself attached and later become an adult through a 
series of processes. 
RESEMBLANCES TO PROTOZOA: 
 Absence of digestive cavity and presence of intracellular digestion. 
 Presence of collar cells and amoeboid cells like cells like those of colonial flagellates. 
 The production of skeleton by single cell or a group of cells. 
 The cells of sponge body are interdependent in their function. 
 DIFFERENCES FROM PROTOZOA: 
 The canal system. 
 The characteristic skeleton. 
 The development of a multi 
 -cellular body from fertilized eggs by cleavage. 
RESEMBLANCES TO MULTI-CELLULAR (Coelentrate). 
 Both are sedentary in habit. 
 Both are diploblastic and acoelomate. 
 The spongocoel of sponges opening out through terminal osculum can be compared 
with the gastrovascular cavity, opening to the exterior by terminal hypostome of 
coelenterates. 
 Asexual reproduction is by budding. 
 The parenchymula larva of sponges are comparable with the planula of coelenterates. 
DIFFERENCE FROM MULTI-CELLULAR (Coelentrates). 
 The cells are comparatively less specialized and inter-dependent than the cells of 
metazoan. 
 Sponges possess choanocytes which are not found in any metazoan. 
 The sponges do not possess an anterior end or head like those of metazoan. 
 The body of sponges is perforated by numerous minute pores and they possess a 
unique system of canals in their body that are not found in metazoa. 
 Sponges have no nervous tissues to coordinate the body activities. 
 There is complete absence of digestive cavity in sponges. 
 
ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF PORIFERA 
Sponges provide protective covering for algae, which in turn produce oxygen for the sponges. 
Crustaceans live parasitic life on them and some molluscs depend upon them for their diet. 

Sponges serve as protective houses for several animals like worms, molluscs, small fishes 
because their enemies cannot feed on the sponges. 
The dried, fibrous skeleton of many sponges are used for the purpose of bathing, polishing, 
washing cars, walls, furniture, and scrubbing floor etc. 
Sponge fishing and its industry is of great economic value to the present synthetic world. 
Only a few sponges are harmful and they may cause the death of sessile animals by covering 
them and cutting off their food and oxygen supply. 
PHYLUM COELENTRATA (CNIDARIA) 
Coelentrata are radially symmetrical diploblastic animals with only epidermis and 
gastrodermis, between these two layers is a jelly-like, non-cellular mesogloea. Epidermis and 
gastrodermis are two layers, each made of a variety of cells showing a division of labour, the 
cells form poorly organized body tissues. They have distinct digestive cavity unlike sponges. 
There is a single coelentron or gastro-vascular cavity which has only one aperture, the mouth. 
The mouth is used both for ingestion and egestion. They are considered primitive because 
they are radially symmetrical (i.e., similar parts are arranged symmetrically around a central 
axis), they lack cephalization. They are the most primitive of animals whose cells are 
organized into distinct tissues, but they lack organs. Only coelentrates manufacture 
microscopic intracellular stinging capsules, known as nematocysts or cnidae, which give the 
phylum its name. They have two body forms—polyp and medusa. 
A polyp has a cylindrical shape. The mouth, surrounded by tentacles, is located at one end of 
the polyp, and the opposite end of the polyp typically attaches to a rock or other object on the 
sea bottom. Polyps may be solitary, as in some types of hydras, or they may attach to other 
polyps to form a colony, as corals do. In some cnidarians, such as those from the genus 
Obelia, the polyps of a single colony may perform specialized functions. Some polyps in a 
colony capture food, others reproduce, and others protect the colony-polymorphism 
 
The medusa body resembles a saucer or umbrella. The mouth is located in the center of the 
undersurface of the saucer-like body, surrounded by tentacles. Medusae are solitary and most 
swim freely in the water. The gelatinous mesoglea layer in medusae is quite thick, which is 
why cnidarians with the medusae body form are commonly referred to as jellyfish. 
 
 There are four classes: 
Scyphozoa: jellyfish. Medusae with the mesoglea much expanded; no true velum. The 
medusa form is dominant but develops from a transient polyp-like sessile stage. Life history 
commonly involves alternation of a very small polyp, the scyphistoma, with a medusa, which 
develops from an ephyra released by the polyp. Gonads are endodermal. Marginal sensory 
structures (rhopalia) with statocysts and/or ocelli. Jellyfish are very common in all oceans; 
they may penetrate shallow seas or be washed ashore. 
   
Hydrozoa: hydroids, typically with both polyp and medusa stages in the life cycle. The 
polyps are small, without mesenteries in the coelenteron, and the medusa may have a velum. 
Colonial forms are commonly polymorphic. Coelenteron is undivided. Gametes ripen in 
ectoderm. Polyp colonies are often intertidal; some groups are oceanic. Hydra lives in fresh 
water. 
. 

Anthozoa: anemones and most corals. Exclusively polypoid with biradial symmetry. Oral end 
is a disk with central mouth and hollow tentacles arising at margin and/or on surface. Polyps 
are with vertical divisions (mesenteries) in the coelenterons-Coelenteron divided by radial 
mesenteries that extend inwards. No medusa forms. An anthozoan polyp reproduces sexually, 
although the polyps of some species also reproduce asexually. Asexual reproduction results 
in a colony if the daughter polyps remain attached to one another.   
Cubozoa:  Tropical, cuboidal medusae that swim strongly. The medusa phase dominates in 
animals in the Cubozoan class. Cubozoan medusae are commonly called box jellies because 
they have a cube shape with a single tentacle or group of tentacles hanging from each corner 
at the mouth end of the animal. The Cubozoan polyp is small and inconspicuous and an entire 
polyp transforms into a medusa in a type of asexual reproduction. 
NUTRITION, RESPIRATION AND EXCRETION: All cnidarians are carnivores. Most use 
their cnidae and associated toxin to capture food, although none is known actually to pursue 
prey. Sessile polyps depend for food on organisms that come into contact with their tentacles. 
Once a food item is captured, tentacles move it to the mouth, either by bending in that 
direction or by passing it to tentacles nearer the mouth. The mouth opens, the lips grasp the 
food, and muscular actions complete swallowing. Food is taken in and wastes are discharged 
through the mouth. Extracellular digestion occurs in the coelenteron, which has, in all except 
hydrozoans and some tiny members of the other classes, radial projections of the wall into the 
coelenteron that increase the surface area. Ingested material is broken down somewhat in the 
coelenteron and then taken up by endodermal cells for final intracellular digestion. 
Respiration and excretion in cnidarians are carried on by individual cells that obtain their 
oxygen directly from water—either that in the coelenteron or that of the environment—and 
return metabolic wastes to it. Thus, all physiological functions are carried out at no more than 
the tissue level of differentiation. 
LOCOMOTION: Cnidarians can move parts of their bodies (mainly the tentacles) and change 
the body shape. Locomotion (movement from place to place) occurs in medusae and also in a 
few polyps. Movement by muscle contraction requires a skeleton, because muscles must have 
some restraint to pull against in order to have any effect, and after contracting they must be 
re-extended, but the skeleton need not be hard. They use the incompressibility of water to 
serve as a hydrostatic skeleton. 
 
NERVE SYSTEM & ORGANS OF SENSATION: 
Medusae have a more highly developed nerve net than do polyps, a feature that is associated 
with the more active way of life of medusae. Swimming is coordinated by the nervous 
system. Nervous systems that are capable of conducting nerve impulses both quickly and 
slowly give these animals considerable behavioral responsiveness and flexibility. Ganglia or 
other accumulations of nerve cell bodies are not found in cnidarians, but there are gap 
junctions between neurons and between neurons and effectors, which allow the transmission 
of nerve impulses. Statocysts, located between the tentacles or near the tentacular base, 
inform the animal of its orientation with respect to gravitational forces. Light-sensitive ocelli 
(external patches of pigment and photoreceptor cells organized in either a flat disk or a pit) 
occur in some medusae of each of the three classes that possess this stage. Such sensory 
structures are closely associated with a nerve net.  
 
REPRODUCTION: 

Reproduction in cnidarians varies among the different species. They may reproduce by means 
of asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction, or both. Polyps generally perform asexual 
reproduction by budding, in which an outgrowth from the body wall separates to form a new 
polyp or medusa. Medusae primarily reproduce sexually—they produce gametes (sex cells), 
and a gamete (sperm) from a male medusa fuses with a gamete (egg) from a female medusa 
to form a zygote. The zygote develops into a larva, which in turn develops into a polyp or 
medusa. The medusae of some cnidarians may also form polyps by budding.  
 
 
Hydra: is a small freshwater commonest polyp, readily obtainable coelenterate. It is found in 
freshwater ponds, pools, lakes, streams and ditches. It usually remains attached to submerged 
vegetation or with any solid object. When it is undisturbed its body remains extended with 
tentacles spread out and shows expansion and contractions without any apparent reason. It is 
CARNIVOROUS in habit and feeds on small insects, insect larva and small crustaceans. It is 
solitary in habit. Reproduction is sexually and asexually. It has cylindrical body and it is 
visible to the naked eyes and when fully extended, it becomes elongated and slender. 
It is tubular and sessile but its proximal end is drawn out into a slender stalk at the end of 
which is the BASAL DISC or PEDAL DISC for attachment to the substratum. The gland 
cells in the disc region secrete adhesive substance for attachment and gas bubble for 
floating. The free distal end or oral end of the body bears HYPOSTOME which bears an 
aperture at its apex called, MOUTH. The mouth opens into the gastro-vascular cavity or 
enteron. The hypostome is encircled by a circlet of tentacles. The tentacles have 
NEMATOCYTES. Conical TESTES occur near the oral end while rounded OVARIES 
are located near the aboral end.  
The body wall consists of two cellular layers, an outer EPIDERMIS derived from 
ECTODERM and inner GASTRODERMIS derived from ENDODERM. It is 
DIPLOBLASTIC. In between the layers is a thin non-cellular layer of jelly-like substance 
called MESOGLOEA. The epidermis is made up of small cubical cells and is covered 
with a delicate cuticle. It forms a thin layer, about one-third of the thickness of the body 
wall. This layer contains several types of cells-epithelio-muscular, interstitial, gland, 
cnidoplast, sensory, nerve and germ cells. The epidermis is protective, muscular and 
sensory in function. The gastrodermis is made up chiefly of large columnar epithelial 
cells with irregular flat bases. The free ends of the cells give a jagged and uneven contour 
to the coelentron in cross section. The gastrodermis forms about two-thirds of the body 
wall and is secretory, digestive, muscular and sensory. The cells of gastrodermis include 
nutritive, muscular, interstitial, sensory, nerve and gland cells. This layer is mainly 
nutritive in function. 
LOCOMOTION: All movements in Hydra are caused by the contraction or the relaxation 
of the contractile muscle fibres. As the gastrodermal muscle fibres are less developed in 
most part of the body wall, the movements are largely due to the contraction of the 
epidermal muscle fibres. It shows the following movements-Looping, expansion and 
contraction, somersaulting, gliding, climbing or Cuttle-fish like movement, floating, and 
swimming. 

NUTRITION: It is exclusively carnivorous and feeds principally on small aquatic animals 
captured by the tentacles aided by the nematocyts. The tentacles hold the captured food, 
contracts and bends over the mouth to transfer it into the mouth and subsequently into the 
enteron. Digestion is both extracellular and intracellular. The indigestible materials are 
ejected through the mouth. 
RESPIRATION & EXCRETION: There are no special organs for respiration and 
excretion. Gaseous exchange occurs through the general body surface. Nitrogenous 
wastes are largely in form of ammonia, which also diffuses through the general body 
surface. 
OSMOREGULATION: The water that continuously enters into the body cells by 
endosmosis is finally collected into the gastrovascular cavity and from here expelled out 
through the mouth due to a wave of muscle contraction passing from the basal disc region 
to the hypostomal region. 
NERVOUS SYSTEM: It possesses a very primitive type of nervous system. There are 
two nerve nets, one in connection with the ectoderm which is more highly developed, and 
the other near the endoderm, the two nerve nets lie in and on either side of the mesogloea. 
But the ectodermal nerve net is more strongly developed and in particularly concentrated 
around the mouth and basal regions. The two nerve nets are joined to each other and to 
the sensory cells of both ectoderm and endoderm, they are also joined to the 
epitheliomuscular cell. There is no brain and ganglia. 
REPRODUCTION: It reproduces asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction is by 
BUDDING. Sexual reproduction is by the fusion of gametes. This process is called 
fertilization and the fertilized ovum is called the zygote. Development begins soon after 
fertilization and the zygote undergoes cleavage or segmentation. Cleavage is 
HOLOBLASTIC resulting in equal-sized cells called blastomeres. This later leads to 
BLASTULATION, GASTRULATION and ENCYSTATION. Encysted embryo remains 
dormant until favourable condition of water and temperature and then, hatches. The 
embryo elongates and a circlet of tentacle buds develops at one end with a mouth 
appearing in their midst. As embryo increases in size, the cyst ruptures and a young 
Hydra with tentacles hatches out. There is no free larval stage in the development of 
Hydra. 
Hydra has the ability to restore the lost or worn out parts of their bodies. And because of 
this ability of Hydra to regenerate itself from the minutest part; it is said to be 
IMMORTAL. 
 
Regeneration in Hydra 
Hydra can regenerate entirely from severed pieces of their bodies, bottom. A body fragment 
will re-grow both head and base. Cells near the head of the hydra, top, are more likely to 
regenerate a head and tentacles. This “polarity” remains with the cell; cells disaggregated and 
restacked in various orders show regrowth according to their original position in the animal. 

Here, tissue from the head region surrounds that of the tail, resulting in tentacles on each end 
of the regenerated organism. In general, animals with higher degrees of tissue differentiation 
than the simple hydra demonstrate lesser abilities to regenerate. 
 
 
 
Obelia: Unlike Hydra which is a solitary polyp, Obelia is a colonial hydroid and has a 
complex life-cycle due to the occurrence of a free-living medusa stage. It consists of a 
horizontal thread-like root called HYDRORHIZA which attaches to the substratum and 
from which a vertical branching stem known as HYDROCAULUS arises. The hydrohiza 
and hydrocaulus are hollow tubes. The hydrocaulus bears zooids or polyps on either side 
in a cymose formation. Each polyp has a stem and a terminal head called a HYDRANTH 
which is the nutritive zooid of the colony. Towards the base of the hydrocaulus in the 
axils of the polyps are reproductive polyps called BLASTOSTYLES. The polyps, their 
tubular connections and blastostyles are made of ectoderm, mesogloea and endoderm, 
these layers are together are COENOSARC and its cavity is an ENTERON which is 
continuous and common to all the members. Digested food is distributed in solution 
through the enteron. The entire colony is covered by a tough, yellow chitin secreted by 
the epidermis; this covering is known as PERISARC. The perisarc forms the exoskeleton  
and it covers the hydrohiza, hyroocaulus and their branches. Perisarc, surrounding the 
hydranth, dilates to form a loose, vase-shaped, protective investment, the 
HYDROTHECA and the one covering the blastostyle, forms a loose, transparent, vase-
like capsule, the GONOTHECA, having a terminal collar-like constriction. The 
blastostyle and the gonotheca is called GONANGIUM. Obelia is trimorphic, that is, it has 
three kinds of zooids viz, nutritive zooids; budding zooids and sexual zooids. Polyps or 
hydranths are nutritive zooids, Gonangia or blastosytles are budding zooids and Medusae 
are sexual buds. The medusa is a modified zooid as a hollow bud from the coenosarc of 

the blastostyle. It has a distinct tetramerous (4-part) radial symmetry with most structures 
occurring in fours or multiples of four.  
THE MEDUSA   
The arched saucer-like body is referred to as the bell.   It has a convex upper, ex-umbrella 
(aboral surface ) and a concave lower, sub-umbrella (oral surface).   The aboral surface is 
smooth and rounded.   In Obelia, the velum, which is characteristic of most 
hydromedusae, is rudimentary and is not visible.   Numerous tentacles extend from the 
margin of the bell.     
In life, the manubrium hangs like a pendulum into the center of the sub-umbrellar space 
below the oral surface.    
 
 The mouth is in the center of the free, oral end of the manubrium and it is surrounded 
by four oral lobes and it leads into gastrovascular cavity of the medusa. The manubrium and 
oral lobes are well supplied with cnidocytes.      
 
 The coelenteron or gastrovascular cavity consists of the stomach at the base of the 
manubrium, where extracellular digestion occurs, and a set of ciliated canals used to 
distribute partly digested food.   The mouth opens into the spacious lumen of the manubrium 
which in turn empties into the stomach.   
 
 Four radial canals extend from the stomach to the periphery of the bell where they 
join the circular ring canal in the margin of the bell. The mesoglea of the ex-umbrella is thick 
and accounts for most of the thickness of the bell.   That of the sub-umbrella is thin.   
Consequently, the radial canals are easier to see in sub-umbrellar view. Projecting from the 
middle of the radial canals are four gonads and since sexes are separate, they are either four 
ovaries or four testes.  Twenty to thirty solid tentacles radiate from the edge of the bell. The 
tentacle epidermis has abundant sensory cells and cnidocytes. The cnidocytes are 
concentrated in rings, or batteries, and are used to sting and subdue the prey. A swollen 
tentacular bulb in the base of each tentacle is the site of intracellular digestion and cnidocyte 
formation.    
 
 There are eight spherical statocysts spaced evenly around the margin of the bell.   
Each is at the base of a tentacle.   The statocysts are hollow, thin-walled, epidermal vesicles 
containing a calcareous statolith and a ciliated sensory epithelium.   There are no ocelli in 
Obelia. 
 
LOCOMOTION: It is sessile and thus does not move from place to place. But the annular 
constrictions of perisarc permit slight swaying movement under the influence of water 
currents and also the polyps can contract and expand their bodies. But medusa and the 
planula larva move freely around. 
 
NUTRITION: The polyps are the feeding zooids of the colony with the aid of their tentacles 
armed with nematocysts. Digestion is both extracellular and intracellular. 
 
RESPIRATION & EXCRETION: No special organs for these. Oxygen from the surrounding 
water diffuses directly into the cells and carbon dioxide and nitrogenous excretory products 
diffuse out.  
 
REPRODUCTION: This asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction is by budding. 

Sexual reproduction is fertilization of the gametes produced by the MEDUSAE that are 
DIOECIOUS. The zygote undergoes complete cleavage to form the BLASTULA with 
blastocoel, and then the GASTRULA, the gastrula elongates and become ciliated to form 
the PLANULA and later HYDRULA which gives rise to Obelia colony. 
 
 
 
Aurelia (Jelly-fish): Occurs in coastal waters of tropical and temperate oceans of the world 
close to the surface of water. It is cosmopolitan in distribution. It lives either singly or in 
large groups found floating or swimming freely. In jelly-fish, medusa is the dominant phase 
in the life history having a free-swimming planula larva, reduced fixed polypoid phase and a 
free-swimming disc-like ephyra larva. 
The medusa of Aurelia is flattened, saucer-shaped gelatinous structure called bell or 
umbrella. It exhibits tetramerous radial symmetry. The body is shallowly convex above and 
concave below and is fringed by a row of closely spaced delicate marginal tentacles. These 
are interrupted by eight equally spaced indentations (notches), each with a sense organ 
(tentaculocyst or rhopallium) between two lappets. There is no velum like those of hydrozoan 

medusa because it lacks muscles and nerve ring. It has only velarium or pseudovelum. 
Central in the concave oral surface is the mouth, on a short manubrium, between four 
tapering oral arms, which are grooved and bear nematocysts along their edges. A short gullet 
through the manubrium connects to the enteron. Many radial canals extend through the 
mesogloea from the four gastric pouches to a ring canal in the bell margin. There are four u-
shaped gonads, one in the floor of each gastric pouch. The nerve net is best developed about 
the bell margin. Each sense organ comprises a pigmented eyespot, a hollow statocyst and two 
sense pits. The exterior surface is covered is covered by epidermis; and the lining of the 
digestive system and canals from mouth inward, the gastric tentacles, and the gonads are 
gastrodermis. 
In feeding, food is caught by oral arms and tentacles and transferred into the mouth. 
Respiration and excretion are through the body surface. 
REPRODUCTION: Asexually reproduction is by budding while sexual reproduction is by 
gonads produced by the medusa. The male gametes from a male medusa are discharged 
internally and leave the body through the mouth with outgoing water current. These are then 
drawn into the body of female medusa through the mouth with water current. Fertilization 
occurs when the male and the female gonads fuse together in the gastric pouch of the female 
medusa to form the zygote. The zygotes are passed out of the mouth of the female medusa 
along with outgoing water current and get attached in the grooves of the oral arms, each 
zygotes gets enclosed in a pouch where it undergoes development. The zygote gives rise to 
the Blastula, Gastrula and become planula larva that is free-swimming. The planula after a 
brief existence loses its cilia and metamorphoses to form small polyp or hydratuba which has 
no perisarc. The hydratuba may bud other hydratubae and later undergoes a process of 
transverse fission called strobilation to become scyphistoma or strobila. Each disc in the 
scyphistoma is an ephyra larva. This later becomes the medusa which starts off another set of 
male and female gonads. 
 

 
 
 
SEA ANEMONES (Metridium): -It is called sea anemones because of their flower-like 
appearance. They occur in all seas being especially abundant in warmer climates in shallow 
and coastal water in solitary or in colonial polyps. It has a short cylindrical body. On the 
upper and flat oral disc are many short hollow tentacles around a slit-like mouth; the pedal 
disc is expanded and is used for fixing the animal to solid objects in the sea, it adhere by 
mucus secretion and by muscles of the basal disc. But the animal is not sedentary because it 
can creep by gliding motion of the basal disc. The column is cylindrical and differentiated 
into an upper short, thin-walled capitulum and a lower main thick-walled scapus. The gullet 
or stomodeum, is a flat tube connecting the mouth and internal cavity (enteron). Along one or 
both sides of the gullet is a smooth ciliated furrow, the siphonoglyph, in which water passes 
to the enteron. Internally the body is divided into radial compartments by six pairs of 
complete septa or mesenteries that extend vertically from the body wall to the gullet; between 
these are other, incomplete septa, attached to the body wall but not reaching the gullet. In the 
septa, beneath the oral disc, are openings or ostia, through which water can pass between the 
internal compartments. The gonads form along margins of the septa. The exterior surface is 
covered completely by tough epidermis, with cilia on the oral disc, tentacles, and gullet, and 
the enteron is entirely lined by gastrodermis. The epidermis contains a net nerve and nerves 
occur in the septa, but no localized sense organs are present.  
 

          
 
                                                               Sea anemone  
 
Respiration and excretion are by the process of diffusion as the epidermis and gastrodermis 
remain in constant contact with water.  
 
REPRODUCTION: Reproduction is asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction is by 
budding, regeneration and longitudinal binary fission. In sexual reproduction, the sexes are 
separate. Eggs and sperm leave the gonads through the mouth, and fertilization occurs in the 
water. The zygote develops into a slender ciliated gastrula; septa soon appear in the 
archenteron, the blastopore becomes a mouth, and long stiff cilia grow on the aboral end as 
the planula larva. This larva creeps on the bottom, and then attaches by the aboral end. With 
growth of the tentacles, septa, and mesogloea, it becomes a miniature anemone. 
 
 
IMPORTANCE OF COELENTRATES 
 Cnidarians skeleton is used in jewelry. 
 All cnidarians have the have the potential to affect human physiology owing to the 
toxicity of their nematocyst. 
 Coral skeletons are used as building material, either in blocks or slaked cement. 
 Extracts of many cnidarians, mostly Anthozoans, have heart-stimulant, anti-tumor and 
anti-inflammatory properties.
