Explaining the Rise
in Youth Suicide
David M. Cutler, Edward L. Glaeser,
and Karen E. Norberg
Emile Durkheim’s Suicide documented a monotonically increasing rela-
tion between age and suicide. Such a relation has been observed repeatedly
since the beginning of the nineteenth century, making it one of the most
robust facts about suicide. The diﬀerences in suicide rates by age are very
large. In the United States in 1950, for example, suicide rates were four
times higher for adults (ages twenty-ﬁve to sixty-four) than for youths (ages
ﬁfteen to twenty-four) and eight times higher for the elderly (sixty-ﬁve and
older) than for youths.1 Economic theory explained this relation naturally,
with the young having the most life to lose and also having the least infor-
mation about what their life will be like (Hamermesh and Soss 1974).
In recent decades, however, the monotonic relation between age and
suicide has disappeared. Figure 5.1 shows suicide rates by age in 1950
and 1990. Between 1950 and 1990, youth-suicide rates tripled (particularly
among young men), while suicide rates for adults fell by 7 percent, and
suicide rates for the elderly fell by 30 percent. In 1990, suicide rates for
young adults (ages twenty to twenty-four) were equal to those for prime-
age adults and were only 25 percent below suicide rates for the elderly.

1. Throughout the paper, we refer to the ﬁfteen- to twenty-four-year-old age group as
youths. We sometimes divide this into teens (ages ﬁfteen to nineteen) and young adults (ages
twenty to twenty-four).

Suicide is now the second or third leading cause of death for youths in the
United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and many countries of
Western Europe.
If youth suicide is an epidemic, attempted suicide is even more so. For
every teen who commits suicide (0.01 percent each year), four hundred
teens report attempting suicide (4 percent per year), one hundred report
requiring medical attention for a suicide attempt (1 percent per year), and
thirty are hospitalized for a suicide attempt (0.3 percent per year).
Why have youth-suicide rates increased so much even as suicide among
adults and the elderly has fallen? Why are there so many suicide attempts?
It is easier to say what suicide is not than what it is. The U.S. rise in youth
suicide has not been centered in America’s troubled inner cities. The states
with the largest increase in youth suicides between 1950 and 1990 are pre-
dominantly rural: Wyoming, South Dakota, Montana, New Mexico, and
Idaho. The states with the most troubled inner cities in fact have the small-
est increases: The District of Columbia, New Jersey, Delaware, Massachu-
setts, and New York. Indeed, when Durkheim wrote, suicide was primarily
an urban phenomenon, but today youth suicides are 15 percent more prev-
alent in rural areas than in urban areas.2
This paper examines some of the economic and social roots of youth
suicide and suicide attempts. Two stories illustrate our results. The ﬁrst is
reported by Rene Diekstra (1989, 16):

2. Durkheim ([1897] 1966) suggested that urban suicide was evidence for the role that
traditional agrarian (and particularly Catholic) society plays in creating a well-functioning
social environment.

It was around noon on 12 August 1969 that 19-year old Jurgen Peters
climbed the ladder on the outside of the water tower in the German city
of Kassel. By the time he reached the top, a number of people were
already gathering where the young man was at.
It soon became clear that he intended to jump all the way down in an
attempt to take his own life. Earlier that morning, Jurgen had been ﬁred
by his boss, a local garage owner for whom he worked as an apprentice
mechanic. The reason had been that, upon being asked to test drive a
client’s car, he instead had gone joy riding and in the process had se-
verely damaged that car as well as two others. Bystanders called the
police, who in turn called the ﬁre department for assistance. A ﬁre lad-
der was put out to the top of the tower, and one of the ﬁremen tried to
talk Jurgen out of his plan, without success, however. Then a girl he
had been dating and liked very much was asked to talk with him. She
succeeded in persuading him to give up his attempt.
While stepping from the water tower onto the ﬁre ladder and starting
his descent, a couple of young men watching the scene began yelling:
“Hey, coward, you don’t even have the guts to jump, do you?” and simi-
lar provocative remarks. One could observe Jurgen hesitating, inter-
rupting his descent. Then all of a sudden he climbed up the ladder,
hopped on the top of the tower and almost in one movement jumped
oﬀit. He died on the spot.
The second was witnessed by one of the authors (see Norberg 1999).
Between 30 December 1996 and 22 July 1997, there was a suicide epidemic
in the white, predominantly low-income community of South Boston,
Massachusetts. The area aﬀected is an economically mixed and histori-
cally embattled community of about thirty thousand, somewhat physically
isolated from the rest of the city. Although the community had been well
represented in the city’s and the state’s political leadership for many years,
its political inﬂuence seemed to be declining. The community was per-
ceived by many observers, both insiders and outsiders, as having been
deeply stressed and demoralized by recent and rapid social changes. Politi-
cal and economic factors that have aﬀected the community over the last
generation include high rates of poverty, organized crime, and substance
abuse and a history of political conﬂict with the rest of the city over school
busing and public-housing integration. Within the previous three years,
there had been new social stresses, including welfare reform, changes in
the local political leadership, a major crackdown on the organized crime
leadership in the community, and the privatization of city and state ser-
vices, with a loss of public-sector jobs that had been the economic base
for the community.
In addition to these general social stresses, there had been a concurrent
drug epidemic that may have been intimately related to the suicide epi-
demic. A nationwide decrease in the price of heroin had resulted in an
Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide
221

increase in heroin use by even very young adolescents in South Boston in
1995 and 1996. Other adolescents, not drug users themselves, reported an
increased feeling of anxiety in the face of the community’s manifest inabil-
ity to stop this increase in serious adolescent drug use. In early 1996, a
ﬁfteen-year-old boy died of an accidental drug overdose in one of the
housing projects in the community. Just before this overdose, he had made
a name for himself by stabbing a man who was accused of raping his sister.
By report, more than a thousand people attended this boy’s wake and
funeral; teenagers tattooed his name on their bodies, and the project hall-
ways are still full of graﬃti recording his name. He seems to have been
memorialized, in part, because his death was seen as symbolic of a general
crisis in the community. The ﬁrst suicide of the epidemic occurred in the
same housing project, close to the one-year anniversary of his death.
By the end of the epidemic, there had been six hanging deaths, all young
white males, along with forty-eight serious but nonlethal suicide attempts,
including ﬁve nearly fatal hanging attempts resulting in medical intensive-
care-unit hospitalizations (all young white males aged ﬁfteen to seventeen),
eight intentional overdoses serious enough to require medical hospitaliza-
tion in addition to psychiatric care, at least thirty-ﬁve other hanging, over-
dose, and other self-injury attempts, and seventy-eight other crisis evalua-
tions resulting in psychiatric hospitalizations among adolescents primarily
aged ﬁfteen to seventeen in this community. The aﬀected adolescents were
more likely to be white and male and more likely to be between the ages
of ﬁfteen and seventeen than children and youths receiving emergency
psychiatric screenings in baseline years. Given an estimated population of
about thirteen hundred teenagers in this community between the ages of
fourteen and seventeen, this represents a thirty-eight-fold higher suicide
rate in the community than the teen suicide rate for the country as a whole,
at least a ﬁvefold increase in cases requiring medical hospitalization, and
a psychiatric hospitalization rate of almost 10 percent of the adolescents
in the community in a single narrow age group. Nearly all the persons
making suicide attempts during this time cited the completed suicides as
one of the stressors aﬀecting them. Thirty-six of the forty-eight serious at-
tempters reported being close to at least one of the teens who died.
These two stories foreshadow several questions that we address in this
paper: What social stressors (such as the lost job for Jurgen and the heroin
epidemic in Boston) are associated with the rise in youth suicide? What is
the role of other high-risk behavior (the joyride, stabbing a community
violator) in prompting crises leading to suicide? What is the role of peer
pressure or social contagion in youth suicide?
We examine these issues of suicide and suicide attempts using two
sources of data. The ﬁrst is Vital Statistics data on youth suicides. These
data are available at the aggregate level since the turn of the century and
at the micro level since 1968. We brieﬂy describe national time trends since
222
David M. Cutler, Edward L. Glaeser, and Karen E. Norberg

1900 and examine state-level cross-sectional data for 1950 and 1990 and
county-level cross-sectional data for 1990. National data record all deaths,
but the attribution of deaths by cause is somewhat problematic. This is
most important in distinguishing between suicides and accidental deaths.
For example, a youth who dies of a self-inﬂicted gunshot wound may be
considered either a suicide or the victim of an accidental death; many
single-vehicle motor-vehicle fatalities are thought to be probable suicides,
although they are usually classiﬁed as accidents. In prior years, when there
was more stigma associated with suicide, the share of deaths coded as ac-
cidents was higher and the share coded as suicides lower. As we discuss
below, we do not think that reporting changes materially aﬀect our conclu-
sions about the reasons for increasing suicide over time.
National data on attempted suicide by youths are not available. Instead,
to study suicide attempts, we turn to the National Longitudinal Survey of
Adolescent Health (AddHealth). The AddHealth study surveys a nation-
ally representative sample of about twenty thousand teenagers, their par-
ents, and their social peers. We examine data from the ﬁrst wave of this
study, which took place in 1996. The AddHealth survey asks youths about
suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and whether the attempt required
medical treatment. It also gathers a broad range of demographic and so-
cial information.
Our empirical analysis leads us to three conclusions. First, we argue that
there is a fundamental distinction between suicide attempts and suicide
completions. While successful suicide is usually the result of a strongly
held intent to end one’s life, most suicide attempts are probably not. In-
stead, many suicide attempts can best be seen as a strategic action on the
part of youths to resolve conﬂicts within themselves, with parents, or with
others. Youths have little direct economic or familial power, and, in such
a situation, self-injury can act as a powerful distress signal. It can also
serve to punish other persons (playing oﬀothers’ empathetic or altruistic
inclinations) or to embarrass or “blackmail” persons who “should” be al-
truistically inclined toward the victim, if the gesture draws the attention
of outside authorities or other persons whose opinion matters to the reluc-
tant altruist.
Many factors suggest that the bulk of suicide attempts are strategic.
For example, women attempt suicide 50 percent more often than men but
complete suicide six times less frequently. Attempted suicides peak for
ﬁfteen-year-olds, while rates of completed suicides climb sharply between
ages ﬁfteen and twenty. Finally, suicide attempts by youths are greater in
families where youths may have more to gain from a shift in resources.
Second, we ﬁnd strong evidence that social interactions are important
in teen suicide. Teenagers are much more likely to attempt suicide when
they know someone else who has attempted suicide, and suicides are
“clumped” across areas in a way suggesting local spillovers. Spillovers may
Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide
223

occur in several ways: an attempt by one person may be more credible if
it follows attempts by others; authorities may take a second suicide at-
tempt more seriously than the ﬁrst; people might learn about eﬀective
techniques from others (e.g., exactly how much medication it takes to get
sick but not die); or youths may provoke other youths to attempt suicide
if the alternative is bringing shame to one’s group by a public display of
stress. The presence of social interactions means that small diﬀerences in
aggregate fundamentals can trigger large shifts in the number of youth
suicides.
The importance of peer interaction in youth suicides was noted by
Durkheim ([1897] 1966) a century ago and has been supported by other in-
vestigators in the current era (Gould et al. 1994). Contagion eﬀects are far
less evident for adults and the elderly, suggesting that social interactions
are less important for these groups.
Third, we ﬁnd that, to the extent that we can explain the rise in youth
suicide over time, the most important aggregate variable explaining this
change seems to be the increased share of youths living in homes with a
divorced parent. To a lesser extent, higher female labor force participation
rates also explain increased rates among males. Divorce rates at the county,
state, and national levels are highly correlated with youth-suicide rates.
The divorce rate is more highly correlated with youth suicides than is the
share of children living with stepparents or the share of children in single-
parent families (both divorced and never-married parents). Female labor
force participation is another potential factor. Higher female labor force
participation predicts higher rates of suicide, particularly for males. At the
individual level, we ﬁnd that family structure and parents’ time budgets
also seem to matter for youths’ suicide attempts, albeit to a much less
important degree than at the aggregate level for youth suicide. Both these
factors predict youth suicide more strongly than they predict adult suicide.
We begin by presenting basic facts about youth suicides and suicide
attempts. The second section discusses diﬀerent theories about teen sui-
cides. The third section presents data on suicide attempts from a nationally
representative survey in 1996, and the fourth section examines county,
state, and national data on completed suicides. The last section concludes.
5.1
Facts about Suicide
We begin with some basic facts about suicide to set the stage for our
later analysis. While some of the facts are well-known, others are not.
5.1.1
Since 1950, Suicide Has Tripled among Youths and
Fallen among Older Adults and the Elderly
Figure 5.1 above shows the change in suicide rates by age from 1950 to
1990. Suicide rates for youths tripled between 1950 and 1990, rising from
224
David M. Cutler, Edward L. Glaeser, and Karen E. Norberg

4.5 per 100,000 to 13.8 per 100,000. In contrast, suicide among adults has
fallen by 10 percent and suicide among the elderly by half.
To highlight the diﬀering trends by age, ﬁgure 5.2 shows suicide rates by
age at decadal intervals over the twentieth century. Suicide rates ﬁrst
peaked about 1910. Suicide rates for adults and particularly the elderly
rose again in the Great Depression and have fallen substantially since
then. Total suicide rates in 1997 are the same as they were in 1950. Suicide
rates for youths, in contrast, declined by 2.5 percent per year from their
peak in 1908 through their trough in 1955 and since then have risen by
2.4 percent per year.
There is an increase in the youth-suicide rate for every single year of
age, as shown in ﬁgure 5.3. Between 1970 and 1980, the percentage in-
crease was roughly the same for all ages. Since 1980, suicide rates in-
creased most rapidly among teenagers aged ﬁfteen to nineteen.
One possible explanation for the rise in teen suicides is that teen deaths
might have been coded as accidents in previous years. While this is cer-
tainly true to some extent, it does not change our ﬁndings materially. Fig-
ure 5.4 shows the suicide rate, the gun-accident deathrate, and the com-
bined suicide and gun-accident rate for youths over time. Unfortunately,
we cannot include motor-vehicle fatalities since motor-vehicle deaths
change for so many other reasons over time (such as changes in car safety
and legal driving speeds). The gun-accident rate declined over time but by
nowhere near as much as the suicide rate increased. Thus, the rise in sui-
cides and gun-accident deaths mirrors the rise in suicides alone.
The fact that suicide rates trend diﬀerently for young adults, older
adults, and the elderly suggests that diﬀerent factors may be at work for
Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide
225

Suicide rates by age over time

the three groups in the population. This is true cross-sectionally as well.
The correlation across states between youth- and adult- (elderly) suicide
rates is only 0.46 (0.49), while the correlation between adult- and elderly
suicide rates is 0.89.
5.1.2
Suicide Is the Third Leading Cause of Death among Youths
U.S. Vital Statistics records indicate that the annual suicide rate for
youths (ﬁfteen to twenty-four) is about thirteen per 100,000, or 0.01 per-
226

cent per year. Over the course of ten years, therefore, about 0.1 percent of
youths will commit suicide. The leading cause of death for youths is acci-
dents (an annual rate of 38.5 per 100,000 in 1995), followed by homicide
(an annual rate of 20.3 per 100,000).
5.1.3
There Are about Two to Four Hundred Suicide Attempts
among Youths for Every Completed Suicide
There are no national surveillance ﬁgures in the United States for sui-
cide attempts; estimates therefore come from a few national surveys and
from local surveillance. As with suicide deaths, there is ambiguity in mea-
suring suicide attempts. There is wide variation in the lethality of intent;
thus, the deﬁnition of suicide attempt varies considerably from one study
to another. The term parasuicide is sometimes used to refer to self-injury
with low likelihood of lethal outcome (e.g., superﬁcial cutting, minor over-
doses), and deliberate self-harm is sometimes used to refer collectively to
self-injuries across the full spectrum of lethality of intent.
Our data on suicide attempts come from AddHealth. Suicide attempts
in AddHealth (described in more detail below) are based on self-reports
and leave the deﬁnition of suicide attempt open to the responding inter-
viewee. Table 5.1 shows data from AddHealth on suicide thoughts and
attempts and from Vital Statistics on successful suicides.
About 14 percent of youths report thinking of suicide in the past year,
and 4 percent report attempting suicide. About 1 percent of youths re-
ported being seen medically for a suicide attempt. Other data from the
National Hospital Discharge Survey indicate that about 0.2 percent of
youths are hospitalized for self-injury each year. As shown in the last col-
umn, these numbers are substantially greater than the rate of the suicides.

Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide
227

There are about three hundred self-reported suicide attempts, about one
hundred “medically seen” suicide attempts, and about sixteen medically
hospitalized suicide attempts for every completed suicide.
These numbers in themselves suggest that not all teen suicide attempts
are made by youths who truly wish to die. Many youths may instead be
engaged in “strategic” suicide attempts—suicide attempts of varying se-
verity, designed to get attention, to punish parents or other role models for
perceived mistreatment, or to embarrass parents or other family members.
Indeed, common sense suggests that succeeding at suicide is not all that
diﬃcult. After all, either a tall building or rope is often available, half of
all households own a gun, and medications such as aspirin or acetomeno-
phen are even easier to ﬁnd and less frightening to use. As such, unsuccess-
ful attempts must usually be thought of as actions that are, for the most
part, designed to elicit a response other than one’s own death. Successful
attempts, on the contrary, most probably reﬂect a desire actually to end
one’s life. As such, we will discuss the theories of successful suicides and
suicide attempts separately.
5.1.4
Girls Attempt Suicide More Often Than Boys;
Boys Commit Suicide More Often Than Girls
Table 5.1 shows suicide rates for various demographic groups. The rate
of suicide attempts is twice as high for girls as it is for boys, but the rate
of successful suicides is six times higher for boys than it is for girls. Diﬀer-
ences in suicide rates are evident throughout the life cycle. Figure 5.5
shows suicide rates by age and gender. Male suicide rates are roughly three

times female rates for adults, before increasing dramatically after age
sixty-ﬁve. Female rates, in contrast, have a relative peak in late middle age.
5.1.5
Suicide Attempts Decrease with Age after Adolescence
Table 5.2 shows suicide attempts by single year of age for youths (from
AddHealth) and adults (from Crosby, Cheltenham, and Sacks 1999).3 The
peak age for suicide attempts is ﬁfteen; attempt rates for eighteen-year-
olds are 15 percent below the rate for ﬁfteen-year-olds.4 Suicidal thoughts
decline in frequency from middle adolescence into adulthood and older
years.
5.1.6
Rates of Suicide and Homicide Are Positively
Correlated in the National Data
Figure 5.6 shows suicide and homicide rates over time. There is a clear
positive correlation between the two. Both rates rose substantially from
1910 through 1930 and then fell through 1960. In both cases, rates rose
again through 1975. Total suicide rates began to fall again in the mid-
1980s, while homicide rates fell in the early 1980s, rose in the late 1980s
and early 1990s, and then have again fallen since 1994. The association be-
tween suicide and homicide is even stronger for youths, as shown in ﬁgure
5.7. Both rates rose from 1910 through 1933, fell over the next twenty to
thirty years, and then began a prolonged increase, with a recent fall in
both beginning in 1994.

Rural, Western States Have the Highest Youth-Suicide Rates
and the Fastest Rate of Increase
Figure 5.8 shows the geographic dispersion in youth-suicide rates in
1950 and 1990. Table 5.3 shows the states with the highest and lowest
suicide rates. Because Alaska and Hawaii were not states in 1950, they are
not included in the ﬁgure. Suicide rates in 1990 are above those in 1950

for all states. But there is substantial dispersion in changes in suicide rates
over time. In 1950, suicide rates averaged 4.6 per 100,000, with a standard
deviation of 2.0 (1.3 without Nevada). In 1990, the average rate was 15.3,
with a standard deviation of 5.4.
Most surprisingly, suicide rates in 1990 are highest in rural, Mountain
states and lowest in urban, Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. The
highest suicide rates in 1990 are in Alaska, Wyoming, Montana, New
Mexico, and South Dakota. This pattern became particularly pronounced
between 1950 and 1990. Rates in Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming
were high in 1950 but not as far above average, those in South Dakota

actually below average. These states replaced states that were relatively
rural in 1950 but became more urban over the time period: California,
Utah, and Arizona.
The states with the lowest suicide rates also changed. In 1950, the lowest
suicide rates were generally in Southern states (Alabama, Tennessee, Mis-
sissippi, and Arkansas). By 1990, the states with the lowest suicide rates
were the District of Columbia, New Jersey, Delaware, Massachusetts, and
New York.
The high rate of suicide in Mountain states does not appear to result
from coding diﬀerences between accidents and suicides. The correlation
between suicide rates and accidental deathrates for teens in 1990 is 0.50.
5.1.8
Blacks Attempt and Complete Fewer Suicides than Whites
Table 5.1 above shows racial diﬀerences in suicide attempts and suicide
completions. Blacks attempt suicide about one-quarter less frequently than
do whites and complete suicides about one-third less. The lower rate of
suicide for blacks than for whites suggests that youth suicides are not just
a result of poor economic prospects. By any measure, whites have much
greater economic prospects than do blacks. This ethnic diﬀerence also ar-
gues against some family-composition explanations, such as the hypothesis
that the lack of a father in the household leads to more youth suicides.
However, during the 1980s, suicide rates increased most rapidly among
young black males, so some changing factors are clearly important in this
relation.
5.1.9
Economic Diﬀerences Are Moderately
Correlated with Suicide Rates
The last rows of table 5.1 above show suicide thoughts and completions
in urban and rural areas and between richer and poorer families.5 Suicide
thoughts are moderately higher in urban areas, although suicide rates are
higher in rural areas. Youths in poorer families are more likely to attempt
and complete suicide than youths in richer families. These economic dif-
ferences are not overwhelmingly large; the diﬀerence between rich and poor
areas, for example, is much smaller than the diﬀerence in suicide between
blacks and whites and between boys and girls.
5.1.10
Teen Suicide Is Primarily Accomplished with Guns
Table 5.4 shows the methods that youths used to commit suicides in
1950 and 1990. In both years, the overwhelmingly large share of deaths
results from guns. Guns were used in 50 percent of deaths in 1950 and 64
percent in 1990. Hanging is second most important in 1990, followed by
5. In the last rows, the suicide rate is based on whether the county had median income
above or below average.

poison. Suicide rates by all methods except poison have increased over
time. The increase is particularly pronounced for gun deaths.
The predominance of guns in teen suicides and the association between
rural, mountainous states and suicide initially incline one toward a means
theory of higher suicide rates: the availability of guns has increased youth
suicides. The cross-state evidence suggests otherwise, however: if anything,
we would expect that guns were relatively more available in rural, moun-
tainous states in 1950 than in 1990.
In contrast to successful suicides, suicide attempters almost never use
guns. Poison is used in over 80 percent of suicide attempts (e.g., drug over-
doses).
5.2
Suicide among Youths: Theory
In explaining youth-suicide attempts and completions, we start oﬀwith
two basic facts. The ﬁrst fact is that people have variable feelings. Every-
one has high and low moments. For youths, the variability of emotions is
particularly great. Evidence suggests that the highs are higher and the lows
lower for youths than for adults. The second fact is that youths do not
have ﬁnancial resources that they can use to inﬂuence others. Youths are
still at the point in life where their consumption exceeds their net income.
These two facts suggest a number of diﬀerent explanations for youth
suicide. We group the alternative explanations into four categories. The
ﬁrst explanation is the strategic suicide theory: youths attempt suicide to
signal others that they are unhappy or to punish others for their unhappi-
ness. In this theory, suicide attempts are not primarily designed to result
in death. Rather, they are a way for youths to inﬂuence others in nonﬁ-
nancial ways. The second theory is the depression theory: at various points,
youths become suﬃciently unhappy that they “rationally” take their life.
The third theory is the contagion theory; it is really an extension of the ﬁrst
two theories, suggesting that a “social multiplier” may amplify the eﬀects
of stressors leading to depression or may amplify the eﬀects of factors
leading to suicidal signaling as a method of conﬂict resolution among

youths. The fourth theory has less to do with events that produce suicide
thoughts and more to do with the ability to carry out suicide plans. We
term this the instrumentality theory: when youths become particularly un-
happy, they commit suicide if the means to do so is readily available. Thus,
youths with access to guns will, for the same level of unhappiness, have
higher suicide rates than will youths without access to guns. We illustrate
each of these potential eﬀects in turn.
5.2.1
The Rational-Suicide Theory
Our ﬁrst theory is the most conventional one: suicide is a means of “ra-
tionally” ending one’s life when the expected value of the future utility of
being alive is below the value of death. The rational-suicide theory was
developed by Hamermesh and Soss (1974) as a way of explaining why
suicide seemed to increase monotonically with age. We have already seen
that this monotonic increase with age is no longer true generally. Indeed,
it was not even true for women at the time that Hamermesh and Soss’s
original paper was written. We further show in the appendix that the
simple prediction of rising suicide rates with age does not necessarily fol-
low from a rational-suicide model. But the intuition holds. Suicide is more
likely when the variability of happiness is high, when unhappiness is corre-
lated over time, and when people have high discount rates. If there is hy-
perbolic discounting, then individuals may want to precommit not to kill
themselves.
Suicide and depression are clearly correlated for youths, as we show
below. The diﬃcult question is how the rational-suicide theory can explain
the increase in youth suicide over time. It is possible that discount rates
have risen over time for the young; changes in such an enduring individual
characteristic could be the result of important changes in family structure
or social environment that determine the individual’s development of the
capacity to regulate impulse. It is also possible that mean utility levels in
youths have declined over time. If this is the driving factor, however, it
must concern goods that are not usually purchased in the market economy
since the average purchasing power of families has not declined.6 A partic-
ularly plausible explanation is that the variance of the utility distribution
has increased. If the variance of utility is greater, more youths will fall
below the utility level at which suicide is a rational action.
We examine this by considering the factors that lead to depression
among youths. Work on happiness suggests that family connections tend
to be particularly important in promoting happiness; for adolescents, the
family may be an important buﬀer for the variability of emotions. Changes
6. Hamermesh and Soss (1974) ﬁnd that suicide and income are correlated at the occupa-
tion level, but this relation is not that strong. Moreover, Durkheim’s ([1897] 1966) earlier
evidence suggests a negative relation between suicide and income.
234

in family relations may have decreased this buﬀering role. Thus, one candi-
date explanation for the rise in teenage suicides is the increase in single-
parent families. Alternatively, divorce, the partial absence of a known fa-
ther, and remarriage might be more important in producing teenage un-
happiness than the absence of a parent entirely because of conﬂict between
ex-partners, conﬂict with a stepparent, or conﬂict with a nonresident par-
ent who may not be as available as the child desires. The child may experi-
ence greater feelings of rejection and unhappiness when certain parental
resources appear to exist but are not being devoted to the child than when
it is clear that parental resources have been exhausted. This may explain
why youth suicides are lower among blacks than among whites and why
the suicide rates among black youths have been rising.
The events that cause depression need not be rationally undertaken for
the suicide itself to be rational. A youth who discounts hyperbolically may
take actions that bring short-term pleasure but long-term costs—stealing
a car, for example, and getting caught, or taking illegal drugs, or engaging
in premarital sex and getting pregnant. The youth who was caught might
prefer ex post not to have stolen the car, but, conditional on being caught,
the teen then faces the prospect of coping with an acute, painful state in
the present in which the magnitude of the present pain (negative utility)
exceeds the (discounted) present value of the possibly brighter future once
the acute pain is past. The hyperbolic discounter has even more trouble
than the “ordinary” discounter in moderating present pain with the hope
for future pleasure—just as he has trouble moderating present exuberance
with the anticipation of future pain.
Much unhappiness in teens may be related to romantic issues. In the
same way that divorce is closely linked with suicide among adults, increas-
ingly early sexual intimacy may contribute to intense turbulence in the
relationships between adolescent sex partners; disappointments, conﬂict,
and rejection in these physically intimate relationships among immature
partners may lead to acute despair. It is possible that increased sexual ac-
tivity among teenagers, stimulated by a number of factors since the 1960s,
including the increased availability of safer and more eﬀective contra-
ception, has been a cause of youth unhappiness and increased suicide.
Families may be important in preventing youths from undertaking these
types of actions, and the decline of the traditional family type may thus
have led to increased suicide through the resulting inﬂuence on impulsive,
long-term detrimental behavior. It is important to note that engaging in
these activities may increase happiness among youths on average but may
still lead to more variance in happiness, resulting in more youth suicides.
Beyond the immediate family, membership in social organizations is
also a strong correlate with happiness. The decline in social capital dis-
cussed by Putnam (2000) and Putnam, Leonardi, and Nanetti (1994) may
have created a rise in teenage unhappiness; indeed, Durkheim ([1897]
Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide
235

1966) argued that traditional societies with tight social connections had
lower suicide rates.
5.2.2
The Strategic-Suicide Theory
A second explanation for youth suicide may be that suicidal behavior is
designed, not to produce death, but merely to signal unhappiness and thus
change the distribution of family resources. We think of this theory as
applying to attempted suicides more than to successful suicides. The value
of suicide as a signal may be direct or indirect. In some cases, the signal
will convince adults that children are truly unhappy, and, thus, parents will
devote more monetary or time resources to the child. Such a signal may
be particularly credible in a repeated interaction. In other cases, the parent
might not want to distribute more resources to the child, but the internal
or external psychic cost (perhaps embarrassment) at having a child at-
tempt suicide will induce the parent to do so anyway. If parents are suﬃ-
ciently powerful in all respects, then self-harm may oﬀer the only means
available to the child of punishing the parents.
To formalize this, we consider a child with utility function V(T, Z),
where T is the amount of time or money that the parent transfers to the
child, and Z is a vector of other factors that inﬂuence child happiness.
Parents derive utility from their own consumption [U(Y  T)] and the
happiness of their child [aV(T, Z)]. The child’s happiness, Z, is known to
the child but not to the parent.
Children who are unhappy may want more parental input.7 If child util-
ity cannot be observed by the parent, children need to signal this unhappi-
ness. Suicide attempts are a credible signal if there is some probability
that they succeed and if the utility loss from death is smaller for unhappy
children. The appendix shows that, if parents have no observable informa-
tion about child happiness, the equilibrium is where children with Z 	 Z*
attempt suicide and children with Z  Z* do not. The appendix also
shows that suicide attempts are more common where Y is higher and thus
there are more resources that suicide can help transfer.
The intuition for these results is simple. Children will want to communi-
cate their unhappiness to parents so that they can get more resources.
Suicide is a signal of this because a child who is less happy values future
life less than one who is happier. As a result, children know that attempt-
ing suicide will convince their parents that they are not happy. But, for the
signal to be transmitted, it must be the case that sometimes the event hap-
pens—on occasion, the child must die.
This prediction that suicide attempts will be more common when paren-
tal resources are greater—because there is more to redistribute—is the
7. Formally, this is a statement that d 2V/dTdz 	 0—the value of parental resources is
greater when the child is exogenously less happy.
236
David M. Cutler, Edward L. Glaeser, and Karen E. Norberg

central prediction for the strategic-suicide theory. This is opposite to the
pure-depression theory, according to which a lack of parental resources
induces child unhappiness and thus increased suicide attempts. We test for
strategic suicide by examining how suicide attempts are related to family
structure and income.
5.2.3
The Contagion Theory
Durkheim argued that suicides are imitative. He gives the example of
ﬁfteen prisoners who hung themselves from exactly the same hook in a
Parisian prison and argues that this shows the power of social imitation.
Several epidemiological studies (e.g., Gould et al. 1994) suggest that social
contagion is a stronger factor in teen suicides and suicide attempts than in
those by adults. It is not surprising to ﬁnd that adolescents seem to be
particularly inﬂuenced by their peer group in this form of high-risk be-
havior.
Contagion may operate in several ways. A member of a group who com-
mits suicide may cause grief and stress within the group; this stress may
decrease the ability of the group to buﬀer the problems faced by other
members of the group or make suicide among other members more ratio-
nal. People may also learn from the suicidal behavior of others: they may
gain more exact information about the pain or discomfort involved in a
particular action, and they may gain information about its probable eﬀec-
tiveness in accomplishing some end.
An important mechanism may involve the increase in the signal value
of a suicide if some aspects become stylized. If a ﬁfteen-year-old boy com-
mits suicide, then other ﬁfteen-year-old boys may draw more than the
usual amount of attention for similar behaviors. If one person attempts or
completes suicide using a particular method, then others may draw more
than the usual attention by using a similar method, within the time frame
during which the environment is sensitized to respond. As the signal be-
comes more stylized, the “receiver” can become more sensitive in detecting
the signal. As the signal reception increases in sensitivity, the minimum
eﬀective signal can become less intense: social contagion may therefore
lead to an increase in frequency, but a decrease in severity, of suicide at-
tempts. Since bad news is more often reported than good news, an increase
in the eﬀective group size to which adolescents are exposed (which could
have occurred, e.g., through the growth of the role of television [e.g., Phil-
lips and Carstensen 1986]) could directly contribute to a rise in the rate
of suicide.
At a certain point, the environment may “catch on” to the changing
signiﬁcance of the stylized attempt and react to less severe attempts with
less attention. This may reduce suicide attempts on the part of those with
only a small desire to attempt suicide. But a more sinister form of social
contagion may also be set in motion. Members of a group may collude
Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide
237

(covertly) to provoke an escalation of tactics leading to the martyrdom of
at least one member of the group. One successful suicide (especially if
widely advertised) may greatly refresh the credibility of the less lethal
threats made by other members.
This may have been the basis for the provocations described in the case
of Jurgen Peters. It is not so much that the other young men in the crowd
were acutely suicidal—presumably they were a more or less random draw
of young men who happened to be nearby, with no more than the average
share of despair typical for young men in that community at that time—
but they may have identiﬁed with Jurgen’s age and gender, and each young
man in the crowd might have expected his own reputation for possible
dangerous action to rise with Jurgen’s violent death. In fact, if they did
not know him, his death may have been no loss to them at all—only an
emblematic event that enhanced their own strategic position in the com-
munity.
The South Boston story also highlights many of these potential eﬀects.
The ﬁrst teen’s accidental death made him a martyr whom other teens
wanted to imitate. And, as the seriousness of the epidemic grew, even hints
of suicide thoughts would be taken more seriously.
5.2.4
The Instrumentality Hypothesis
The ﬁnal theory is the instrumentality hypothesis—that access to lethal
means increases suicides. This theory stresses the immediate costs and
beneﬁts of suicide, not the long-term forward-thinking behavior of the
other models. In this theory, suicide is impulsive, and access to the appro-
priate method at the right time can determine whether a suicide occurs.
The instrumentality explanation is most commonly applied to access to
guns. As we saw above, teenagers overwhelmingly commit suicides using
guns. Brent et al. (1991) and Brent et al. (1993) show that adolescents who
committed suicide were about four times as likely to live in a home with
any gun than were a matched group of community or psychiatric controls
and were thirty-two times more likely to have lived in a home where a gun
was kept loaded. The availability of guns diﬀers greatly over space and
thus could explain some of the geographic distribution of youth suicide.
Beyond ﬁrearms, there is some evidence that diﬀerences in access to lethal
methods—tall buildings in Manhattan (Marzuk et al. 1992), coal gas in
the United Kingdom—may be associated with diﬀerences in rates of com-
pleted suicide.
The counterhypothesis is that lethal means of one kind or another—for
example, hanging or jumping from a height—are so widely available that
a suicidal person will simply substitute one method for another, depending
on which one is more accessible. A classic example is bridge barriers: if
one bridge is fenced, the suicidal person may simply ﬁnd another nearby
bridge to use instead (O’Carroll and Silverman 1993).
238
David M. Cutler, Edward L. Glaeser, and Karen E. Norberg

The strongest evidence against the instrumentality theory is noted
above: youth-suicide rates have increased the most in areas where guns
have historically been the most plentiful—rural, Western states. The in-
strumentality theory would predict the opposite, that suicide rates would
rise most in urban areas with high poverty, where guns have become in-
creasingly common in more recent years.
There could be another, more subtle role for instrumentality, linked to
the social-contagion models described above. Perhaps there has been an
increase in nonlethal suicide attempts, driven by an increase in the avail-
ability of dangerous but usually nonlethal methods: for example, prescrip-
tion psychotropic medications, which came into more common use starting
in the 1960s.
5.3
Evidence on Suicide Attempts
We start our empirical analysis by looking at suicide attempts. We ex-
amine attempts with an eye to which of our four theories appears to oﬀer
the best prediction of adolescent self-injury.
The data that we use are from AddHealth. AddHealth is a nationally
representative stratiﬁed random sample of U.S. high school students in the
ninth to the twelfth grades; the survey is based on direct interviews with
the adolescents themselves, their parents, and school administrators and
covers a wide range of topics concerning risk and protective factors for
high-risk adolescent behavior. Our sample consists of 17,004 adolescents
between the ages of twelve and eighteen in 1996 for whom we have the
necessary observations from the ﬁrst wave of the AddHealth survey. The
key features of the results presented here can also be observed when we
consider outcomes in wave 2, but the 25 percent sample attrition between
waves makes these results less statistically signiﬁcant.
Our primary dependent variable is whether the youth reported a medi-
cally screened suicide attempt. We focus on medically screened attempts
to get some measure of severity of attempt. Reporting issues may also
inﬂuence whether some youths report less severe suicide attempts. We also
examine reports of suicide attempts whether or not they were treated medi-
cally. Our results are very consistent across these two samples. We note
one obvious feature of this sample: youths who successfully committed
suicide are not in the sample. Thus, these data tell us about the determi-
nants of “unsuccessful” suicide attempts only. Four percent of teens re-
ported making a suicide attempt in wave 1, and 1 percent reported a sui-
cide attempt that resulted in some kind of medical contact.8
We relate the probability that the teen has made a suicide attempt to a
variety of factors reﬂecting the diﬀerent theories outlined above. Table 5.5
8. In wave 2, 0.7 percent of teens reported making a medically screened attempt.

describes these variables and shows the means and (where appropriate)
standard deviations. Our ﬁrst measures are demographic controls: age (in
single years), gender, ethnicity, and urban residence.
To capture family resources, we include family-income and employment
variables. The strategic-suicide theory argues that more family resources
should increase suicide attempts. The rational-suicide explanation argues
that more family resources should decrease suicide attempts if lower levels
of resources are associated with decreased happiness among youths.
We also include measures of family structure and interactions with par-
ents: how often the mother and father are home in the evening; whether
there is a father present physically or in the life of the teen; and the teen’s
relationship with the mother, with a resident father, and with a nonresident
father. The relationship variables are measured on a ﬁve-point scale aggre-
gating questions about the frequency of speciﬁc activities and interactions
between the teen and the parent. The strategic-suicide theory suggests that
having a father present but not around should increase suicide attempts,
as should a worse relationship with parents. The depression theory sug-
gests that being without a father entirely should be worse than having a
parent around but not in the household.
We include a variety of measures of activities of the teen, including mea-
sures of sexual activity (a dummy variable for whether the teen has ever
had sexual intercourse; a dummy for whether the teen has been raped),
measures of violence and delinquency (a normalized delinquency score;
whether the teen has ever used a weapon; and whether the teen was hurt
by violence), measures of drug and alcohol use (dummies for hard drug
use or alcohol problems), and participation in various clubs (the total
number of clubs; membership in an honor society; whether the child par-
ticipates in sports; and the number of hours per week spent watching tele-
vision). These partly measure happiness and partly measure the potential
for conﬂict. The happiness theory suggests that teens who engage in these
activities but have bad outcomes should attempt suicide more.
A clear issue with these variables is the endogeneity problem: children
who take drugs more, for example, may be more likely to attempt suicide

for other reasons. Without instruments for these teen activities, we cannot
resolve the causality question.9 We thus primarily think of these regres-
sions as correlations more than a strict theory of causation. Some infer-
ences can be made, however, by comparing the eﬀect of diﬀerent activities
on suicide rates. The happiness explanation argues that teens who engage
in these activities but suﬀer adverse outcomes (e.g., being arrested for drug
use) would be more likely to commit suicide. Teens who engage in these
activities but do not suﬀer adverse outcomes, however, would be no more
likely to commit suicide.
We also include measures of social contagion: whether a relative or
friend has attempted suicide and whether a relative or friend has success-
fully committed suicide. These variables permit particularly valuable tests
of the social-contagion theory.10
Table 5.6 shows our regression results. We report OLS estimates for ease
of interpretation; logit and probit models had very similar qualitative and
quantitative results (when expressed as changes in probabilities). Recall
that the dependent-variable mean is 1 percent, so small coeﬃcients are to
be expected. The ﬁrst column of the table includes the basic demographic
variables (which are included in all regressions) and the variables for fam-
ily income and employment. The ﬁrst row shows that girls are 0.8 percent-
age points, or 56 percent, more likely to report a relatively serious suicide
attempt than are boys. This is consistent with the raw data described
above: boys complete suicides more than girls, but girls attempt suicide
more than boys. The next set of variables indicates ethnicity; Native Amer-
ican teens have 67 percent higher rates, Asian American teens have 23
percent higher rates, and African American teens have 10 percent lower
suicide-attempt rates than white teens. These rates are not statistically sig-
niﬁcant, although they are statistically signiﬁcant predictors of having at-
tempted a suicide (whether or not it was medically treated).
There is a nonlinear relation between suicide attempts and age. At-
tempted suicides rise from age twelve to age ﬁfteen (the omitted age
dummy) and then decline. This stands in stark contrast to successful sui-
cides, which rise sharply over these ages. One possible explanation for
these results is that teenage independence increases at age sixteen, for ex-
ample, the ability to drive. As such, the need either to signal parents or to
punish them through self-damage may decrease with increasing age.
The next variables in the ﬁrst column are for family economic status.
9. While AddHealth has a longitudinal component, even longitudinal data would not solve
the endogeneity problem. It would still be necessary to know why teens start to engage in
these activities.
10. One might worry somewhat about depression running in families and thus there being
a common genetic component to suicide. Our results are similar for friends and relatives,
however. One might also be worried about the self-selection of friends. Without instruments
for one’s friends (and it is not clear what such instruments might be), we do not have a way
of addressing this issue.

Increased income reduces suicide attempts. A one-standard-deviation in-
crease in family income decreases the risk of suicide attempt by almost 40
percent. Similarly, individuals whose families receive welfare are 30 per-
cent more likely to attempt suicide.11 It is unclear whether the welfare vari-
able is picking up an income eﬀect or a stigma eﬀect; 1996 (the year of the
ﬁrst wave of AddHealth) was the year in which welfare reform was enacted
into law, and thus discussion of welfare in a negative context was promi-
nent. The income variables generally support the happiness explanation
over the strategic explanation.
The second regression replaces the economic variables with family-
structure variables. Teens who live with a single parent have about twice
the rate of suicide attempts of those in two-parent families, even when one
of the parents is a stepparent. Most surprisingly, we ﬁnd that teens who
know their father but whose father is not now in the home are just as likely
to attempt suicide as teens who never knew their father. This is suggestive
evidence of the strategic theory: suicide attempts may be a means to get
an absent father to pay more attention to his children.
As the next rows show, teens who engage in more activities with their
mother and nonresident father are less likely to attempt suicide. There is
no such eﬀect for relationship with a resident father. A one-standard-
deviation increase in time spent with a mother decreases the risk of suicide
attempt by about 27 percent. This is a very substantial eﬀect. The eﬀect
of time with the nonresident father but not the resident father again sug-
gests a strategic motive.
The third regression considers the relation between adolescent suicide
attempts and other kinds of adolescent behavior. Sexual activity, rape,
drug use, alcohol problems, and being hurt in a ﬁght are among the strong-
est behavioral predictors of suicide attempts. Girls who report being raped
are much more likely to attempt suicide than are other girls. Hard drug use
more than doubles the risk of suicide attempt. A one-standard-deviation
increase in minor delinquency increases the risk of suicide attempt by 25
percent.
Teens who have hurt others are more likely to have attempted suicide,
as are teens who have been hurt in conﬂicts. The latter eﬀect is particularly
large; teens who have been hurt in conﬂicts are 75 percent more likely to
attempt suicide.12 Perhaps self-injurious impulses lead to getting hurt in
a ﬁght. Alternatively, being fearful and bullied may precipitate self-
injurious impulses.
Membership in an honor society or engaging in weekly sports provided
protection from the risk of making a suicide attempt, although not statisti-
cally signiﬁcantly so.
11. In regressions that separate eﬀects by gender, the welfare eﬀect was particularly impor-
tant for girls.
12. In regressions by gender, boys who have been injured during a ﬁght are two times as
likely to attempt suicide.

The evidence is clearly consistent with the happiness theory; unhappi-
ness may cause both suicide attempts and other high-risk behavior. How-
ever, the evidence is also consistent with a strategic model: high-risk be-
havior may lead to negative consequences; suicide attempts may mitigate
negative consequences by enlisting a response from the social environ-
ment. The evidence could also reﬂect other factors—perhaps individual
biological vulnerability, early development, or present environmental con-
ditions—that jointly inﬂuence happiness, suicide attempts, and other high-
risk behavior.
The next regression considers the possible eﬀects of social contagion.
Teens who know friends or family members who have attempted suicide
are about three times more likely to attempt suicide than are teens who do
not know someone who attempted suicide. As best we can tell, this ﬁnding
is causal. When we examine wave 2 data, teens who had not already made
a suicide attempt in wave 1 are more likely to attempt suicide if they have
a friend or relative who attempted suicide. We also ﬁnd that teens who
have had a family member commit suicide are more likely to report a sui-
cide attempt in wave 1, but only half as likely to make an attempt in wave
2, as other teens. This suggests a complex model of contagion, consistent
with our strategic-suicide hypothesis: teens who have experienced the sui-
cide of an intimate may be suﬃciently aware of the pain that this causes
that they are less likely to engage in a merely symbolic attempt.
There are also signiﬁcant gender diﬀerences in the pattern of social con-
tagion. In separate regressions for girls and boys, girls are more likely to
make a suicide attempt if they know someone else who has made an at-
tempt; boys are less aﬀected by attempts of other people but more aﬀected
by knowing someone who completed suicide. This suggests a social mecha-
nism for the diﬀerence in completed suicide rates for boys and for girls.
Groups of boys may dare and shame each other into maintaining the
group’s reputation for courage or dangerousness. Girls may be more willing
to imitate a “failed” suicide attempt because they do not require the same
level of reputation for daring.
The ﬁfth column includes all these diﬀerent variables together. The re-
sults are generally consistent with the regressions including the variables
separately. The factors most strongly related to suicide attempts are the
interaction-with-parents variables, the teen-activities variables, and the
contagion variables.
In the ﬁnal regression of the table, we add a measure of depression to
the regression. The “feelings” scale used in the AddHealth survey is a
modiﬁcation of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale
(CESD) (Radloﬀ1977). The CESD is one of the most widely used mea-
sures in mental health epidemiology; it has been used in thousands of
studies, and its psychometric properties are well-known. The AddHealth
measure has dropped two items from the original twenty, rephrased two
items, and added one. In the present study, we have standardized the Add-
Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide
247

Health feelings scale with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The
eﬀect is large; a one-standard-deviation increase in reported depression
nearly doubles the suicide risk. More surprisingly, the other variables in
the regression generally still aﬀect suicide attempts, even when the depres-
sion variable is included. Most of the variables are smaller in magnitude
in column 6 than in column 5, but they generally still predict suicide at-
tempts. Thus, not all the eﬀect of these variables on suicides is through
their inﬂuence on happiness.
Table 5.7 presents estimates of similar models for the broader measure
of whether the teen reported attempting suicide, independent of whether
it was medically treated. For ease of interpretation, we report only the
results including all the variables together (equivalent to col. 5 of table 5.6
above) and that regression including the measure of depression (equivalent
to col. 6 of table 5.6).
The results are similar to, and perhaps even stronger than, the results
for medically treated suicide attempts. The signs of the coeﬃcients are
generally similar, but, because the dependent variable has a much higher
mean (4 percent), the coeﬃcients are larger, and more of them are statisti-
cally signiﬁcant. The most important variables predicting this measure of
suicide attempts are interaction with the mother and particularly a nonres-
ident father, teen variables such as drug use and having been raped, and
the social-contagion variables. The age eﬀects are also pronounced. Sui-
cide attempts peak at age fourteen and then decline through age eighteen.
Depression is clearly related to suicide attempts, but it does not fully ex-
plain this pattern of results.
5.3.1
The Roots of Depression
To understand the role of happiness in explaining suicide among youths,
we consider the determinants of depression among teens. We have already
seen the relation between the teen variables and attempted suicides, both
with and without depression as a control. These auxiliary regressions will
help us determine which of these variables inﬂuence suicide through their
eﬀect on depression. These variables are also useful as a test of our previ-
ous results. Since suicide attempts are relatively rare, it may be that these
depression results are more reliable than our results for suicide attempts.
Table 5.8 relates the depression scale to the independent variables in-
cluded in table 5.6 above. The ﬁrst regression in table 5.8 shows the rela-
tion between our demographic characteristics and depression (recall that
the index has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1). The age eﬀects
are sizable and diﬀerent than those for suicide attempts. Younger teens are
much less likely to be depressed than are older teens, by about one-third
of a standard deviation. Girls are more depressed than are boys. Again the
eﬀect is large—nearly one-quarter of a standard deviation. All the racial
and ethnic minorities have higher rates of depression than do whites. Liv-
ing in an urban area also increases depression.

Income is positively and strongly associated with happiness. Higher in-
come reduces depression, and being on welfare increases depression. There
is no eﬀect of mother’s labor force participation on depression. Economists
may be surprised that the coeﬃcient for income is not all that large. Absent
fathers and mothers appear to be more important than income in pre-
dicting depression among teenagers.

The second regression shows that the relationship with one’s parents is
a very strong determinant of teenage depression. Individuals who never
knew their fathers are particularly likely to be depressed, even more so
than those who know their father but whose father is not home. Note that
these coeﬃcients were about the same in the regressions for attempting sui-
cide. Teens who report more interactions with their parents are much less
likely to be depressed. This eﬀect is large and supports the idea that par-
ents’ behavior can make a large diﬀerence to the happiness of teenagers.
The third regression shows that sexual activity predicts depression. One
explanation for this is that romantic turmoil may increase the volatility of
emotions, but there are certainly other explanations. Possibly, individuals
who have not had sex live in more socially protective environments that
ﬁght depression in other ways. Use of drugs and alcohol is also related
(not surprisingly) to depression. Again, the direction of causality for these
variables is not completely clear. Delinquency is also correlated with de-
pression. Having been hurt is a particularly strong positive predictor of
depression, which may partially explain its earlier correlation with suicide
attempts. Indeed, in table 5.5 above, the coeﬃcient on having been hurt
falls nearly by half when the depression variable is included. These vari-
ables may again reﬂect either direction of causality. It may be, for example,
that delinquency leads people to be unhappy or that unhappiness makes
delinquency seem relatively more attractive.
There is a signiﬁcant relation between social interactions and depres-
sion. Teens who watch more television are more depressed than are teens
that watch less television, and club membership is negatively related to
depression. This corresponds well to the well-known correlation between
organization membership and happiness in adult surveys. Honors society
membership, sports participation, and religion all strongly reduce depres-
sion.
It is interesting that the maximum R2 in our depression model is only 16
percent. The factors that we identify are related to depression, but, de-
tailed as they are, there is substantial variance beyond these factors, and
they work through other dimensions as well.
5.3.2
Summary
Our analysis of suicide attempts and teen depression leads us to three
conclusions. First, we ﬁnd clear evidence for the happiness theory. More
depressed teens or teens with other problems leading to poor life prospects
are more likely to attempt suicide than are other teens. This ﬁnding is not
surprising. Second, there is strong evidence of social contagion; having a
friend or relative attempt or commit suicide increases the risk that a given
teen does as well. Third, there is suggestive evidence that the strategic
theory is true as well. The age pattern of suicide attempts matches the
predictions of the strategic theory—particularly in the light of opposite
254

ﬁndings for depression—as do factors such as the characteristics of an
absent father.
5.4
Completed Suicides
Suicide attempts are only part of our interest. We are also interested in
the determinants of youth suicide itself. In this section, we examine the
factors that predict youth suicide.
As with suicide attempts, we face data problems when attempting to
measure suicide completions. In the case of suicide completions, there are
very few data on the characteristics of individuals who commit suicide.
Death records contain some information but generally nothing about the
individual’s mood, relations with others, activities, etc. Some psychologi-
cal-autopsy studies have been performed, but these, too, have problems:
the samples are small and the information often sketchy.
Accordingly, we address the problem of suicide completions using a
diﬀerent tack. We examine suicide rates at the national, state, and county
level and consider what factors explain diﬀering levels of suicide at a point
in time and diﬀering changes in suicide rates over time. Our primary anal-
ysis is based on county-level average suicide rates for the period 1989–91.
Individual counties are identiﬁed only if they have more than 100,000
people. We thus form a sample of all counties identiﬁed individually and
group the remaining counties into one observation for each state. The re-
sult is a sample of 516 county groups. Analysis of county groups is neces-
sarily less convincing than having individual data, but, in this circum-
stance, individual data are simply not available.
As noted above, suicide completions are very diﬀerent from suicide at-
tempts. The two behaviors involve diﬀerent methods and demographic
groups. Most psychological-audit studies ﬁnd that people who successfully
commit suicide intend to die, whereas most people who attempt suicide
probably do not. Equivalently, we suspect that people who do not strongly
want to die but do constitute a small share of total suicides. Accordingly,
we move away from considerations of strategic suicide attempts in our
analysis of completed suicides. We instead consider the factors that would
lead to more people truly wishing to end their lives.
This leaves us with three principal theories of suicide to test: the rational
theory; the contagion theory; and the instrumentality theory. We examine
the evidence for each of these theories in this section.
5.4.1
A First Test of Contagion
We start by considering possible evidence of contagion in suicide rates.
To do this, we borrow a technique from Glaeser, Sacerdote, and Scheink-
man (1996) and examine the excess variance of suicide rates across areas.
The idea is simple. If each individual has a probability p of committing
Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide
255

suicide, diﬀerent areas will on average have a share p of people commit
suicide, with some variance around that. Because p is a binomial variable,
the variance of the theoretical suicide rate across areas is known. Conta-
gion in suicide will make some counties have a higher suicide rate and
other areas have a lower suicide rate. This would show up as an excess
variance of the suicide rate across counties, even if the mean suicide rate
is unaﬀected. Thus, a nonparametric test of suicide contagion is to com-
pare the theoretical variance of suicide rates across counties with the ac-
tual variance of suicide rates across counties.
Formally, the test is the following. The social interaction index is deﬁned
as follows:

where Nj refers to the population of county j, pj is the suicide rate in county
j, and pUS is the suicide rate in the United States as a whole. If there are
no social interactions, the index should take on a value of 1.
In evaluating youth suicides, the index value is 156—substantially above
the expected value. For adult suicide, the index value is 50—still high but
much smaller than that for youths. By comparison, comparable numbers
for robbery and murder are 400 and 10, respectively. The implication is
that teen suicide has signiﬁcant social interactions, at least relative to
adult suicide.
5.4.2
Explaining Suicide Rates across Counties
In the light of this result, we now look at several predictors of the youth-
suicide rate across counties designed to proxy for our diﬀerent theories.
Variable descriptions and means are reported in table 5.9. We include ba-
sic demographic controls for urbanicity (dummy variables for large urban
area, small urban area, farm) and the share of the area that is black, Native
American, and Asian American. Our primarily explanatory variables are
grouped into three categories. The ﬁrst variable is the logarithm of median
income in 1989, taken from the 1990 census. In our regressions for suicide
attempts, income was signiﬁcantly negatively associated with attempted
suicide. The rational theory suggests that income should be negatively as-
sociated with completed suicides as well.
Our second variables are measures of family characteristics—the share
of women in the county who are divorced, the share of children who are
stepchildren, and the share of female-headed families. These variables are
similar to the family-structure variables in our models for attempted sui-
cide. It is important to note that these variables refer to current living
status as of the time of the 1990 census. For example, the female divorce
256
David M. Cutler, Edward L. Glaeser, and Karen E. Norberg

rate is the share of women who are divorced and have not remarried. If
the woman were remarried, she would report herself as married in the
census. These measures are not ideal for our purpose—we would prefer to
know the share of women who have ever been divorced, but this informa-
tion is not available. About 9 percent of women are divorced, 5 percent of
children live with a stepparent, and 18 percent of households are female
headed.
Finally, to test the instrumentality theory, we include the share of people
who own guns and the share of people who hunt. Gun ownership is mea-
sured at the state level in the National Opinion Research Center’s General
Social Survey (GSS) between 1972 and 1994. We aggregate these years to
get precision; still, the variable is somewhat suspect because, while the
GSS is designed to be representative at the national level, it is not represen-
tative at the state level. The share of people who hunt is measured at the
county level by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Close to half of all
people own a gun, while only 8 percent hunt.
Table 5.10 shows regressions relating these variables to youth-suicide
rates. The ﬁrst regression includes just urbanicity and demographic con-
trols. The racial variables enter as expected. Percentage black is (insignif-
icantly) negative, and percentage Native American is signiﬁcantly posi-
tive. Percentage Asian is also positive. This corresponds with the basic
ethnic patterns described above. We ﬁnd no particular relation between

urbanization and teen suicide across counties, but the percentage of the
population living on farms positively predicts suicide.
As the second column shows, there is a negative eﬀect of median income
on suicide rates, just as the economic model of suicide predicts. As income
increases by 25 percent (roughly one standard deviation), the suicide rate
drops by nearly 1.4 per 100,000, 11 percent of the mean amount. This is a
reasonably large eﬀect. Controlling for income causes the coeﬃcients on
race and urban status to become signiﬁcant.
The third regression shows the eﬀect of the divorce rate in the county
on suicide rates. The divorce rate is strongly positive and quantitatively
important. As the divorce rate increases by 2 percent (one standard devia-
tion), the suicide rate rises by two per 100,000, 18 percent of the baseline
amount. The connection between divorce and suicide at the aggregate level
is well-known; Durkheim makes much of it. The usual explanation for
this relation is that divorced individuals are more likely to commit suicide.
Clearly, this is not the explanation for teen suicides.
There are several possible explanations for the divorce variable. One hy-
pothesis is that more women work when the divorce rate increases and that
having mothers who work is bad for teens because it reduces the amount of
attention that they receive from parents. The diﬀerence in female employ-
ment rates in the United States and Europe has been cited by some as a
reason for higher suicide rates among teens in the United States compared
to Europe. A second theory is that there are more female-headed families
in areas where there are more divorces and that children in female-headed
families are more likely to commit suicide. From the AddHealth data, we
know that the relation between single-parent families and suicide attempts
is not particularly strong, so we are somewhat skeptical of this theory. A
second explanation is that there are more stepchildren when divorce rates
are higher and that conﬂict between stepchildren and their stepparents
increases suicide rates. Again, we saw in AddHealth that there was little
eﬀect of a relation with a resident father on suicide, so we are somewhat
skeptical of this theory. A third explanation is that, when more families
divorce, teens have poorer relationships—but some relationship—with
their fathers, and this increases the risk of suicide. In the AddHealth data,
the relationship with a nonresident father was strongly predictive of sui-
cidal behavior. Glaeser and Glendon (1998) report that the persons who
are most likely to own guns are adult males, especially in the age range of
fathers of teenage children. The strategic-suicide theory predicts that ac-
cess to some parental resources (in this case, access to the father’s time or
income) predicts higher rates of self-injury than access to the least parental
resources. Strategic conﬂict with parents, or a combination of strategic
conﬂict and access to a gun owned by an adult male, may explain the
association between divorce and youth suicide. A ﬁnal explanation is that
260
David M. Cutler, Edward L. Glaeser, and Karen E. Norberg

the divorce rate proxies for other factors in a community—social disorder,
community conﬂict, general unhappiness, etc.—that inﬂuence youth-
suicide rates.
To test these theories, we include measures of female labor force partici-
pation rates, the share of children who are stepchildren, and the share of
families that are female headed. The fourth regression shows that the latter
two variables are both related to suicide but that female labor force partici-
pation is not. The ﬁfth column includes these three variables with the fe-
male divorce rate. Controlling for female divorce rates, the share of step-
children and the share of female-headed families have a negative eﬀect on
youth suicides. Having a father who was once in the household appears to
be more important for suicide than being without a father at all. Unfortu-
nately, we do not have information at the county level on contact between
children and absent fathers, so we cannot diﬀerentiate between that and
other explanations of community factors. As such, the relation between
the divorce rate and the youth-suicide rate remains something of a puzzle.
The next two columns show the relation between guns and youth sui-
cide. There is mild evidence for the instrumentality theory. In areas where
there is more hunting, suicide rates are higher. But this is not true of gun
ownership in general, which we expect would be more closely related to
youth suicide. Further, the increase in suicide in rural areas—despite the
much more rapid increase in gun ownership in urban areas—casts doubt
on the instrumentality theory.
The last column reports results for the suicide rate among adults. The
same factors may, or may not, predict adult- and youth-suicide rates. We
present the models primarily for comparison purposes. For adults, we ﬁnd
that income is a more signiﬁcant predictor of suicide than it is for children.
Comparing the seventh and eighth columns, the coeﬃcient on income is
small and statistically insigniﬁcant for youths but negative and statistically
signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level for adults. The greater income eﬀect for
adults matches the time-series evidence presented above. Female divorce
rates are also related to suicide rates for adults, but the magnitude is one-
third smaller than that for youths. This is again consistent with our theo-
ries and casual time-series evidence. Finally, we ﬁnd no evidence that the
other social characteristics aﬀect adult-suicide rates and only weak evi-
dence for the instrumentality theory.
5.4.3
Changes in Suicide Rates across States
A second test of these theories is to see whether they predict changes in
suicide rates over time. The suicide rate started to increase in about 1950,
so we consider data from 1950 to 1990. Data on suicide rates at the county
level are not available prior to 1970. Accordingly, we focus on analysis at
the state level. Such analysis is less than ideal; there were only forty-nine
Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide
261

states in 1950 (including Washington, D.C.), so our standard errors are
large. We thus consider the state-level analysis to be more suggestive
than deﬁnitive.
Table 5.11 reports regression results for changes in state suicide rates
between 1950 and 1990. The ﬁrst column reports results for youths, and
the second column reports results for total suicides. The regressions do not
include data on gun ownership or hunting; such information is not avail-
able over time. The speciﬁcation is thus equivalent to column 5 of table
5.10 above. The income eﬀects are consistent for youth suicides but not
total suicides. In states where income increased least, the youth suicide
rate rose more. Further, the magnitude of the coeﬃcient on income is very
similar in the two models of youth suicide. In contrast, income has no

eﬀect on total suicides in the state model but is associated with suicide for
adults in the cross-county model (the coeﬃcient from the regression for
adults equivalent to col. 5 is 11.60 [2.35]).
The coeﬃcient on the female divorce rate is positive but not statistically
signiﬁcant. Compared to table 5.10, the magnitude is less than one-third
as large. Increased female divorce rates are also positively related to overall
suicides but not statistically signiﬁcantly so. In contrast, the female labor
force participation rate is signiﬁcantly related to increases in youth-suicide
rates. A 7 percent increase in female labor force participation rates
(roughly one standard deviation in the cross section) raises youth-suicide
rates by two per 100,000. This eﬀect is not found for total suicides, only
for youth suicides. This ﬁnding is diﬀerent from the cross-county evidence,
where female labor force participation is not related to youth suicide.
The last two columns diﬀerentiate between male and female youth sui-
cides. The coeﬃcients on income, divorce rates, and especially female la-
bor force participation are greater for male suicides than for female sui-
cides. Since male suicide rates have increased more than female suicide
rates, this suggests that these results may contribute to the true explanation
for rising suicide among youths.
5.4.4
Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide
The natural question is which of these factors (if any) can explain the
increase in youth suicide over time. We use our cross-county regressions
to address this since we have more observations and controls with these
data. This estimate also allows us to see how well a cross-sectional analysis
can predict a time-series change, a valuable exercise in itself.
To address this question, we consider a simple decomposition. Knowing
that pr(suicide)j  i jX i
j where i indexes all the factors that determine
suicide, then  pr(suicide)  i iXi. Thus, using our estimate of the
importance of factors from the previous section, we will ask whether the
change in observable variables is large enough to justify the observed over-
all change in suicide.
The AddHealth data suggested four variables that might seem to be
robustly correlated with suicidal behavior at magnitudes that could explain
the general rise in suicide: depression; delinquency; relationships with par-
ents; and drug use. The cross-country analysis suggests that cross-sectional
diﬀerences in teen suicide rates may be related to divorce rates, and both
the AddHealth data and the cross-county data suggest that peer pressure
or social contagion may amplify the eﬀects of particular social stressors,
with the result that adolescents may be aﬀected by such community factors
as the divorce rate even if their own individual families are not directly in-
volved.
Since there are no really convincing data on teen depression over time,
we know of no direct way to evaluate whether the rising suicide rates have
Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide
263

resulted from rising levels of teen depression. Indeed, Blanchﬂower and
Oswald (2000) examine data from social surveys in the United States and
Western Europe and conclude that mean “happiness” among youths has
been increasing, not decreasing, over the last few decades. Of course, this
is a statement about the median of the distribution, not the lower tail.
Delinquency and drug use have both risen signiﬁcantly across this time
period. We do not have good data on drug-use increase, and the impor-
tance of drugs cannot therefore be estimated. As shown above, there is a
relation between the time-series movements of teen homicide and teen
suicide. However, we cannot think about the changes in drug use, delin-
quency, and homicide as exogenous variation, so we leave this issue for
further study.
Finally, although we have no national measures of the relationship be-
tween parents and children, we can measure the divorce rate. Between
1950 and 1990, the divorce rate rose from 2.3 percent to 8.8 percent. If we
use the coeﬃcient estimate from the third column of table 5.10, this sug-
gests that there should have been an increase of 7.22 teenage suicides per
100,000 owing to the increase in the divorce rate. The actual increase was
10.5 suicides. Thus, if we believe this coeﬃcient estimate, and if we treat
the increase in the divorce rate as an exogenous variable, the rise in the
divorce rate can explain more than two-thirds of the rise in teenage suicide.
Some conﬁrmation of this theory is provided by aggregate time-series
evidence. Figure 5.9 shows divorce rates and suicide rates in the twentieth
century. In the ﬁrst half of the century, the two do not seem to be highly
correlated. Divorce rates were very low and rose only modestly (from 1 to

2 percent, exclusive of the post–World War II spike), while youth-suicide
rates had a general downward trend. Since 1950, however, divorce rates
and suicide rates track each other closely. Both were ﬂat in the 1950s, rose
in the late 1960s, and plateaued in the mid-1990s. It may be that, when
divorce rates were high enough to be a signiﬁcant factor in community life,
trends in divorce rates became a signiﬁcant driving factor for youths.
Clearly, these regressions and calculations should be taken with numer-
ous shakers of salt, but they suggest that there is at least one coherent
theory that can explain the basic facts. At a minimum, this theory deserves
much further exploration.
5.5
Conclusion
Youth-suicide rates have tripled in the past three decades, and there are
as many as four hundred suicide attempts for every suicide completion.
Why the epidemic in youth suicide?
Our analysis of youth-suicide attempts and completions leads us to
three conclusions. First, we ﬁnd that suicide attempts are quite diﬀerent
from actual suicides and lend themselves to a strategic-suicide model. We
interpret many youth-suicide attempts as signals of need or as ways to
punish parents or other adults. Other suicide attempts are a result of bad
things that happen to youths; the link between delinquency, drug use, sex-
ual activity, victimization, and suicide is clear and strong. Some of these
reﬂect the bad outcomes of risks that youths take, while others may be
simply a product of the environments in which youths are raised.
It is harder to determine empirically whether completed suicides are the
result of what we might consider to be strategic motivations. But we have
found evidence for certain common factors that may have inﬂuenced the
dramatic rise in youth suicide and what has probably been a rise in suicide
attempts. The most important of these variables is the female divorce rate.
In areas where more women are divorced, youth suicides are greater. This
eﬀect is large; if one takes the increase in divorce rates over time in consid-
eration, one can explain as much as two-thirds of the increase in youth
suicide.
Social contagion also plays a particularly important role in teen suicide
and parasuicide. We ﬁnd individual-level evidence of contagion in the Add-
Health data and statistical evidence of nonrandom clustering in the
county-level Vital Statistics. Contagion may involve the direct inﬂuence of
one teen’s suicidal behavior on another, or it may involve more indirect
social and cultural processes, but, in either case, these “neighborhood ef-
fects” may multiply the eﬀects of government policies or other exogenous
shocks.
Economic opportunity plays a mixed role. The strategic-suicide model
predicts that suicidal behavior may increase under circumstances where
Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide
265

there are greater resources to be accessed. On the other hand, rising labor
force participation may have had a protective eﬀect for young women, and
higher income is associated with reductions in suicide at the county level.
The factors that we have identiﬁed all deserve more research, but we
are reasonably certain that the ﬁnal answer to this question will have to
encompass the data and explanations that we put forth here.
Appendix
The Strategic-Suicide Theory
We show in this appendix that, if parents have no knowledge about
child utility, and if transfers substitute for innate happiness, a signaling
equilibrium can exist where all children with Z 	 Z* engage in a suicide
attempt and all children with Z  Z* do not.
Consider a case where Z* is the cutoﬀpoint for attempting suicide. In
this equilibrium, the transfers conditional on attempting suicide solve
U(Y  T)  aE[V(T, Z)|Z 	 Z*], and the transfers conditional on not
attempting suicide solve U(Y  T)  aE[V(T, Z)|Z  Z*]. We will de-
note the transfers conditional on attempting suicide as T(Z*) and the
transfers conditional on not attempting suicide as T(Z*) for the same Z*.
Then Z* must be found so that individuals with that level of innate
unhappiness (Z*) are indiﬀerent between attempting suicide and not, that
is, (1  d) V[T(Z*), Z*]  V[T(Z*), Z*]. From the assumption d 2V/
dTdZ 	 0, everyone with Z  Z* strictly prefers no suicide attempt, and
everyone with Z 	 Z* strictly prefers a suicide attempt. In fact, because
the prospect of loss of life becomes less important as the teen becomes
more unhappy, even with some (bounded) positive values of d 2V/dTdZ 	
0, it will still be the case that there is a single crossing property where the
more unhappy gravitate toward suicide.
Finally, we must prove that there exists a level of Z* where this signaling
equilibrium occurs. In principle, this requires proving that there exists a
level of Z* where (1  d) V[T(Z*), Z*]  V[T(Z*), Z*] equals 0. We
speciﬁcally assume that V(T, 0) 	 0, so that the most unhappy teenagers
would actually commit suicide for nonstrategic reasons, and that dV(T, 1)
 V1(0, 1)  Y, so that the happiest person would never commit suicide.
Furthermore, we assume that all the derivatives of V(T, Z) are ﬁnite. From
the concavity of V( , ), it follows that

At Z*  0, the third term is clearly positive since V(T, Z) 	 0. At Z* 
1, the ﬁrst term is clearly negative from dV(T, 1)  V1(0, 1)  Y. As such,
(1  d) V[T(Z*), Z*]  V[T(Z*), Z*] goes from negative to positive as
Z* rises. The function is always continuous, so there must be at least one
ﬁxed point, from standard arguments. As such, as long as the happiest
teenager will never attempt suicide and the least happy will always attempt
suicide, there will exist an equilibrium where suicide serves as a signal. (In
fact, there may exist multiple equilibria in this case if the function [1  d]
V{T[Z*], Z*}  V{T[Z*], Z*} is not monotonic.)
The Rational-Suicide Model
To formalize the rational-suicide model, we assume that individuals live
three periods (youth, midlife, and old age). In each period, individuals
receive a utility level equal to t. Individuals learn the utility that they will
receive at the start of each period and at that point decide whether to
commit suicide. Utility is assumed to follow a random walk: t  t1 
εt. For simplicity, consider the possibility that εt is a binary random vari-
able that takes on values of ε and ε with equal probability. Individuals
discount the future with a discount factor  (which includes the probabil-
ity of death from other causes). The expected utility from death is normal-
ized to 0.
In the last period, the individual commits suicide if 3 	 0. In the sec-
ond period, the individual’s decision whether to commit suicide takes into
account both current utility and the option value of living for a third pe-
riod. Thus, this individual will commit suicide if second-period utility (if
the individual does not commit suicide) is 2 	 ε/(2  ). In the ﬁrst
period, the individual will commit suicide if 1 	 (2  2)ε/(4  2
 2).
Thus, the ﬁrst-period suicide rate will be highest when random shocks
are large or when discounting is very high. Obviously, anything that raises
the mean level of unhappiness in the ﬁrst period will also increase suicide.
Just as the basic model predicts, the cutoﬀfor suicide becomes progres-
sively less stringent as people age. The option value of living makes indi-
viduals less likely to respond to current happiness. But this does not mean
that individuals will be more likely to commit suicide as they age. If F()
describes the cumulative distribution of 1, then the number of suicides in
the ﬁrst period will be F[(2  2)ε/(4  2  2)]. The number of
suicides in the second period will be 0.5{F[2ε/(2  )]  F[(2  2)ε/
(4  2  2)]}. There is no reason to think that the number of suicides
will increase over time. In the ﬁrst period, individuals ﬁrst learn their un-
happiness, and the optimal suicide strategy suggests that many of them
should be expected to commit suicide initially, as long as there is signiﬁ-
cant persistence in happiness levels. Further algebra also shows that it is
quite possible that the suicide rate declines between youth and middle age
and then rises again in old age.

It is worth emphasizing that, in the rational-actor model, individuals in
the future will be grateful if the marginal suicide is prevented. The mar-
ginal suicide is sacriﬁcing a positive future expected utility to alleviate
current unhappiness. Thus, the intertemporal intrapersonal conﬂict that is
most associated with suicide occurs with exponential discounting.
With hyperbolic discounting, it will be the case that individuals would
like to commit themselves not to commit suicide at some point in the fu-
ture. For example, in the model outlined above, if discounting is hyperbolic
and individuals discount one period ahead by a factor , then the suicide
cutoﬀin the second period will be 2 	 ε/(2  ). However, with
hyperbolic discounting, individuals in period 1 discount periods 2 and 3
by , so, in period 1, individuals would like to ensure that they will commit
suicide only if 2 	 ε/(2  ). As such, in period 1, individuals would
like to prevent themselves from committing suicide in the future in some
cases.
