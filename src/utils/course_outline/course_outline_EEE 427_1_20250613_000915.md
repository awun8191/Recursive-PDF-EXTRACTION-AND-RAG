# Course Title: Introduction to Data Communications and Computer Networks

## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles, technologies, and protocols underlying modern data communications and computer networks. Starting with the basic concepts of data representation, signals, and transmission media, the course delves into key areas such as signal encoding, modulation, error detection and correction, and data compression. Students will explore the foundational network models, including the OSI and TCP/IP architectures, understanding the functions and interactions of each layer. A significant portion of the course focuses on network layer concepts, covering IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes, subnetting, CIDR, NAT, and IP header formats. The course also examines essential network functions like switching (circuit, packet, message) and routing, exploring various algorithms, design goals, and metrics. Network classifications (LAN, MAN, WAN) and physical/logical topologies are also covered, providing a holistic view of network structure and operation.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Explain the fundamental concepts, characteristics, and components of data communication systems and computer networks.
2.  Differentiate between analog and digital data and signals, and describe their key characteristics (e.g., amplitude, frequency, phase, bit rate, baud rate).
3.  Apply Fourier analysis concepts to understand the bandwidth of signals and transmission media.
4.  Calculate theoretical maximum data rates for communication channels using the Nyquist and Shannon theorems.
5.  Describe common transmission impairments (attenuation, distortion, noise) and their effects on signal transmission.
6.  Explain various signal encoding techniques for converting data to signals, including line coding schemes and modulation methods (analog-to-analog, digital-to-analog, analog-to-digital).
7.  Understand the principles of data compression and multimedia encoding.
8.  Analyze and apply techniques for error detection and correction in data transmission, including concepts like redundancy, Hamming distance, and CRC.
9.  Compare and contrast different data transmission modes (parallel, serial, synchronous, asynchronous).
10. Explain the layered architecture concept and describe the functions of each layer in the OSI and TCP/IP network models.
11. Understand and apply IPv4 addressing concepts, including classful addressing, subnetting, CIDR, and NAT.
12. Describe the structure and purpose of the IPv4 header format.
13. Explain the need for and features of IPv6, including addressing schemes, special addresses, header formats, autoconfiguration (DHCPv6), and transition mechanisms.
14. Differentiate between circuit, packet, and message switching techniques.
15. Describe common network types (LAN, MAN, WAN, private, public, point-to-point, broadcast) and physical/logical network topologies (mesh, star, tree, ring, bus, hybrid).
16. Explain the basic concepts of routing, including path determination, routing algorithms (types, design goals), and routing metrics.
