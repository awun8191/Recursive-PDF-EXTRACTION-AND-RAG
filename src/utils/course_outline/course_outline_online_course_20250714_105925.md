## Course Title
Data Communications and Networking Fundamentals

## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles and technologies of data communications and computer networking. Students will explore the foundational concepts of data transmission, including signal characteristics, bandwidth, and transmission media. The course delves into established network models like the OSI and TCP/IP suites, examining the functions and protocols associated with each layer. Key topics include data encoding, error detection and correction, network topologies, switching techniques (circuit, packet, message), and routing algorithms. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to understanding Internet Protocol (IP) addressing, covering both IPv4 (including subnetting, CIDR, and NAT) and IPv6 (addressing, header formats, and transition mechanisms). The course emphasizes the practical aspects of networking through theoretical study and analysis.
