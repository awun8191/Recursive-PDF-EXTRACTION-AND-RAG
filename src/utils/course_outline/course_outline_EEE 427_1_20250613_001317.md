## Course Title

Data Communications and Networking Fundamentals

## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the foundational concepts of data communications and computer networking. Starting with the basic principles of data representation and signal transmission, the course explores the physical and logical aspects of connecting devices and exchanging information. Key topics include the nature of data and signals, bandwidth limitations, transmission impairments, signal encoding and modulation techniques, and methods for handling errors in communication. The course delves into layered network models like the OSI and TCP/IP suites, explaining the function and interaction of each layer. A significant portion is dedicated to network layer concepts, covering IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, network infrastructure types and topologies, and the essential principles of switching and routing, including various switching methods and routing algorithms and metrics. The course aims to equip students with a solid understanding of how networks are designed, function, and enable modern communication.
